off O

sometimes O
happens O
that O

who O

it O
occurs O

fully O
worthy O

the O

bestowed O
by O
the O
disinterested O

Now O
, O
Miss O

Sedley E-PERSON
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
this O
singular O
species O

deserved O
not O
only O
all O
that O
Miss O

said O
in O
her O
praise O

but O
had O
many O
charming O
qualities O
which O
that O
pompous O
old O
Minerva S-PERSON

could O
not O
see O

from O
the O
differences O
of O
rank O

age O
between O
her O
pupil O

herself O
. O
For O
she O
could O
not O
only O
sing O
like O
a O
lark O
, O
or O
a O
Mrs. O
Billington S-PERSON
, O
and O
dance O
like O
Hillisberg S-PERSON

Parisot S-PERSON

and O
embroider O
beautifully O
| | O
and O
spell O
as O
well O
as O
a O
Dixonary O
itself O

but O
she O
had O
such O
a O
kindly O
, O
smiling O
, O
tender O
, O
gentle O
, O
generous O
heart O
of O
her O
own O
, O
as O
won O
the O
love O
of O
everybody O
who O
came O
near O
her O
, O
from O
Minerva S-PERSON
herself O
down O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
in O
the O
scullery O
, O
and O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
- O
eyed O
tart O
- O
woman’s O
daughter O
, O
who O
was O
permitted O
to O
vend O
her O
wares O
once O
a O
week O
to O
the O
young O
ladies O
in O
the O

She O
had O
twelve S-CARDINAL

bosom O

out O
of O
the O
twenty B-DATE

four E-DATE

Even O
envious O
Miss O

never O
spoke O
ill O
of O
her O
, O
high O
and O
mighty O
Miss B-WORK_OF_ART
Saltire E-WORK_OF_ART
( O
Lord O
Dexter’s S-PERSON
granddaughter O
) O
allowed O
that O
her O
figure O
was O
genteel O

and O
as O
for O
Miss O
Swartz S-PERSON
, O
the O
rich O
woolly O

haired O
mulatto O
from O
St. B-GPE
Kitt’s E-GPE
, O
on O
the O
day O
Amelia S-PERSON
went O
away O
, O
she O
was O
in O
such O
a O
passion O
of O
tears O
, O
that O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
send O
for O
Dr. O
Floss S-PERSON
, O
and O
half O
tipsify O
her O
with O
salvolatile O
. O
Miss O
Pinkerton’s S-PERSON
attachment O
was O
, O
as O
may O
be O
supposed O
, O
from O
the O
high O
position O
and O
eminent O
virtues O
of O
that O
lady O
, O
calm O
and O
dignified O
| | O
but O
Miss O
Jemima S-PERSON
had O
already O
whimpered O
several O
times O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
departure O
| | O
and O
, O
but O
for O
fear O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
would O
have O
gone O
off O
in O
downright O
hysterics O
, O
like O
the O
heiress O
( O
who O
paid O
double O
) O
of O
St. B-GPE
Kitt’s E-GPE
. O
Such O
luxury O
of O
grief O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O
allowed O
to O
parlour O
- O
boarders O
. O
Honest O
Jemima S-PERSON
had O
all O
the O
bills O
, O
and O
the O
washing O
, O
and O
the O
mending O
, O
and O
the O
puddings O
, O
and O
the O
plate O
and O
crockery O
, O
and O
the O
servants O
to O
superintend O
. O
But O
why O
speak O
about O
her O
? O
It O
is O
probable O
that O
we O
shall O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
again O
from O
this O
moment O
to O
the O
end O
of O
time O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
great O
filigree O
iron O
gates O
are O
once O
closed O
on O
her O
, O
she O
and O
her O
awful O
sister O
will O
never O
issue O
therefrom O
into O
this O
little O
world O
of O
history O
. O
But O
as O
we O
are O
to O
see O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
saying O
, O
at O
the O
outset O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a O
dear O
little O
creature O
| | O
and O
a O
great O
mercy O
it O
is O
, O
both O
in O
life O
and O
in O
novels O
, O
which O
( O
and O
the O
latter O
especially O
) O
abound O
in O
villains O
of O
the O
most O
sombre O
sort O
, O
that O
we O
are O
to O
have O
for O
a O
constant O
companion O
, O
so O
guileless O
and O
good O
- O
natured O
a O
person O
. O
As O
she O
is O
not O
a O
heroine O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
describe O
her O
person O
| | O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
her O
nose O
was O
rather O
short O
than O
otherwise O
, O
and O
her O
cheeks O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
round O
and O
red O
for O
a O
heroine O
| | O
but O
her O
face O
blushed O
with O
rosy O
health O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
with O
the O
freshest O
of O
smiles O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
which O
sparkled O
with O
the O
brightest O
and O
honestest O
good O
- O
humour O
, O
except O
indeed O
when O
they O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
that O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
often O
| | O
for O
the O
silly O
thing O
would O
cry O
over O
a O
dead O
canary O
- O
bird O
| | O
or O
over O
a O
mouse O
, O
that O
the O
cat O
haply O
had O
seized O
upon O
| | O
or O
over O
the O
end O
of O
a O
novel O
, O
were O
it O
ever O
so O
stupid O

and O
as O
for O
saying O
an O
unkind O
word O
to O
her O
, O
were O
any O
persons O
hard O
- O
hearted O
enough O
to O
do O
so O
— O
why O
, O
so O
much O
the O
worse O
for O
them O
. O
Even O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
, O
that O
austere O
and O
god O
- O
like O
woman O
, O
ceased O
scolding O
her O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
though O
she O
no O
more O
comprehended O
sensibility O
than O
she O
did O
Algebra S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
gave O
all O
masters O
and O
teachers O
particulars O
orders O
to O
treat O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
with O
the O
utmost O
gentleness O
, O
as O
harsh O
treatment O
was O
injurious O
to O
her O
. O
So O
that O
when O
the O
day O
of O
departure O
came O
, O
between O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
customs O
of O
laughing O
and O
crying O
, O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
greatly O
puzzled O
how O
to O
act O
. O
She O
was O
glad O
to O
go O
home O
, O
and O
yet O
most O
wofully O
sad O
at O
leaving O

the O

followed O
her O

The O

the O

with O
a O
grin O
, O
and O
packed O
by O
the O
coachman O
with O
a O
corresponding O
sneer O
— O
the O
hour O
for O
parting O
came O

and O
the O
grief O
of O
that O
moment O
was O
considerably O
lessened O
by O
the O
admirable O
discourse O
which O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
addressed O
to O
her O
pupil O
. O
Not O
that O
the O
parting O
speech O
caused O
Amelia S-PERSON
to O
philosophise O
, O
or O
that O
it O
armed O
her O
in O
any O
way O
with O
a O
calmness O
, O
the O
result O
of O
argument O

but O
it O
was O
intolerably O
dull O
, O
pompous O
and O
tedious O
| | O
and O
having O
the O
fear O
of O
her O
schoolmistress O
greatly O
before O
her O
eyes O
, O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
did O
not O
venture O
, O
in O
her O
presence O
, O
to O
give O
way O
to O
any O
ebullitions O
of O
private O
grief O
. O
A O
seed O
- O
cake O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
were O
produced O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
as O
on O
the O
solemn O
occasions O
of O
the O
visits O
of O
parents O
, O
and O
these O
refreshments O
being O
partaken O
of O
, O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
at O
liberty O
to O
depart O
. O
“ O
You’ll O
go O

say O
good O

by O
to O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
, O
Becky S-PERSON
! O
” O
said O
Miss O
Jemima S-PERSON
to O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
whom O
nobody O
took O
any O
notice O
and O
who O
was O
coming O
down O
stairs O
with O
her O
own O
bandbox O
. O
“ O
I O
suppose O
I O
must O
, O
” O
said O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
calmly O
, O
and O
much O
to O
the O
wonder O
of O
Miss O
Jemima S-PERSON
| | O
and O
the O
latter O
having O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
receiving O
permission O
to O
come O
in O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
advanced O
in O
a O
very O
unconcerned O
manner O
, O
and O
said O
in O
French S-LANGUAGE
, O
and O
with O
a O
perfect O
accent O
, O
“ O
Mademoiselle S-PERSON
, O
je O
viens O
vous O
faire O
mes O
adieux O
. O
” O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
did O
not O
understand O
French S-LANGUAGE
| | O
she O
only O
directed O
those O
who O
did O
: O
but O
biting O
her O
lips O
and O
throwing O
up O
her O
venerable O
and O
Roman S-NORP
- O
nosed O
head O
, O
( O
on O
the O
top O
of O
which O
figured O
a O
large O
and O
solemn O
turban O
, O
) O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
I O
wish O
you O
a O
good O
morning O
. O
” O
As O
the B-PERSON
Hammersmith I-PERSON
Semiramis E-PERSON
spoke O
, O
she O
waved O
one S-CARDINAL
hand O
, O
both O
by O
the O
way O
of O
adieu O
, O
and O
to O
give O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
an O
opportunity O
of O
shaking O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
fingers O
of O
the O
hand O
which O
was O
left O
out O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
only O
folded O
her O
own O
hands O
with O
a O
very O
frigid O
smile O
and O
bow O
, O
and O
quite O
declined O
to O
accept O
the O
proffered O
honour O
| | O
on O
which O
Semiramis S-PERSON
tossed O
up O
her O
turban O
more O
indignantly O
than O
ever O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
battle O
between O
the O
young O
lady O
and O
the O
old O
one O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
was O
worsted O
. O
“ O
Heaven O
bless O
you O
, O
my O
child O
, O
” O
said O
she O
, O
embracing O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
and O
scowling O
the O
while O
over O
the O
girl’s O
shoulder O
at O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Come O
away O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Miss O
Jemima S-PERSON
, O
pulling O
the O
young O
woman O
away O
in O
great O
alarm O
, O
and O
the O
drawingroom O
door O
closed O
upon O
them O
for O
ever O
. O
Then O
came O
the O
struggle O
and O
parting O
below O
. O
Words O
refuse O
to O
tell O
it O
. O
All O
the O
servants O
were O
there O
in O
the O
hall O
— O
all O
the O
dear O
friends O

all O
the O
young O
ladies O
— O
the O
dancing O

master O
who O
had O
just O
arrived O

and O
there O
was O
such O
a O
scuffling O
, O
and O
hugging O
, O
and O
kissing O
, O
and O
crying O
, O
with O
the O
hysterical O
yoops O
of O
Miss O
Swartz S-PERSON
, O
the O
parlour O
- O
boarder O
, O
from O
her O
room O
, O
as O
no O
pen O
can O
depict O
, O
and O
as O
the O
tender O
heart O
would O
fain O
pass O
over O
. O
The O
embracing O
was O
over O

they O
parted O
— O
that O
is O
, O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
parted O
from O
her O
friends O
. O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
had O
demurely O
entered O
the O
carriage O
some B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before E-TIME
. O
Nobody O
cried O
for O
leaving O
her O
. O
Sambo O
of O
the O
bandy O
legs O
slammed O
the O
carriage O
door O
on O
his O
young O
weeping O
mistress O
. O
He O
sprang O
up O
behind O
the O
carriage O
. O
“ O
Stop O
! O
” O
cried O
Miss O
Jemima S-PERSON
, O
rushing O
to O
the O
gate O
with O
a O
parcel O
. O
“ O
It’s O
some O
sandwiches O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
” O
said O
she O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
“ O
You O

” O
And O
the O
kind O
creature O
retreated O
into O
the O
garden O
, O
overcome O
with O
emotion O
. O
But O
, O
lo O
! O
and O
just O
as O
the O
coach O
drove O
off O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
put O
her O
pale O
face O
out O
of O
the O
window O
and O
actually O
flung O
the O
book O
back O
into O
the O
garden O
. O
This O
almost O
caused O
Jemima S-PERSON
to O
faint O
with O
terror O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
I O
never O
, O
” O
— O
said O
she O
— O
“ O
what O
an O
audacious O
” O
— O
Emotion O
prevented O
her O
from O
completing O
either O
sentence O
. O
The O
carriage O
rolled O
away O

the O
great O
gates O
were O
closed O

the O
bell O
rang O
for O

the O
young O

which O
had O
before O

an O
almost O
livid O
look O

hatred O

assumed O
a O
smile O
that O
perhaps O
was O
scarcely O
more O
agreeable O

she O
sank O
back O
in O
the O
carriage O
in O
an O
easy O

that O
talking O

this O
little O

Miss O

twice O

thank O
Heaven O

it O
has O
been O

All O
the O

this O
young O
misanthropist O

we O
may O
be O
pretty O
certain O
that O

all O

treats O
ill O

entirely O
the O
treatment O

The O
world O
is O
a O

let O
all O

Miss O
Sharp’s S-PERSON
father O
was O
an O
artist O
, O
and O
in O
that O
quality O
had O
given O
lessons O
of O
drawing O
at O
Miss B-ORG
Pinkerton’s I-ORG
school E-ORG

He O
was O
a O
clever O
man O

a O
pleasant O
companion O

a O
careless O
student O

with O
a O
great O
propensity O
for O
running O
into O
debt O

and O
a O
partiality O
for O
the O
tavern O

When O
he O
was O
drunk O
, O
he O
used O
to O
beat O
his O
wife O
and O
daughter O

and O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
with O
a O
headache O
, O
he O
would O
rail O
at O
the O
world O
for O
its O
neglect O
of O
his O
genius O
, O
and O
abuse O
, O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
cleverness O

and O
sometimes O
with O
perfect O
reason O
, O
the O
fools O
, O
his O
brother O
painters O
. O
As O
it O
was O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
that O
he O
could O
keep O
himself O
, O
and O
as O
he O
owed O
money O
for O
a O
mile O
round O
Soho S-GPE
, O
where O
he O
lived O
, O
he O
thought O
to O
better O
his O
circumstances O
by O
marrying O
a O
young O
woman O
of O
the O
French S-NORP
nation O
, O
who O
was O
by O
profession O
an O
opera- O
girl O
. O
The O
humble O
calling O
of O
her O
female O
parent O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
never O
alluded O
to O
, O
but O
used O
to O
state O
subsequently O
that O
the O
Entrechats S-PERSON
were O
a O
noble O
family O
of O
Gascony S-PERSON
, O
and O
took O
great O
pride O
in O
her O
descent O
from O
them O
. O
And O
curious O
it O
is O
, O
that O
as O
she O
advanced O
in O
life O
this O
young O
lady’s O
ancestors O
increased O
in O
rank O
and O
splendour O
. O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
mother O
had O
had O
some O
education O
somewhere O
, O
and O
the O
daughter O
spoke O
French S-LANGUAGE
with O
purity O
and O
a O
Parisian S-NORP
accent O
. O
It O
was O
in O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
rather O
a O
rare O
accomplishment O
, O
and O
led O
to O
her O
engagement O
with O
the O
orthodox O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
. O
For O
her O
mother O
being O
dead O
, O
her O
father O
, O
finding O
himself O
not O
likely O
to O
recover O
, O
after O
his O
third S-ORDINAL
attack O
of O
delirium O
tremens O
, O
wrote O
a O
manly O
and O
pathetic O
letter O
to O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
, O
recommending O
the O
orphan O
child O
to O
her O
protection O
, O
and O
so O
descended O
to O
the O
grave O
, O
after O
two S-CARDINAL
bailiffs O
had O
quarrelled O
over O
his O
corpse O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
seventeen S-DATE

she O
came O
to O
Chiswick S-GPE

was O
bound O
over O

an O
articled O
pupil O

her O
duties O
being O
to O
talk O
French S-LANGUAGE

we O

her O
privileges O
to O

cost O
free O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
few O
guineas O
a O
year O
, O
to O
gather O
scraps O
of O
knowledge O
from O
the O
professors O

attended O
the O
school O

She O
was O
small O

slight O
in O
person O

pale O

sandy O

with O
eyes O
habitually O
cast O
down O

looked O
up O

were O
very O
large O

odd O

attractive O

so O
attractive O

that O
the O

the O
Reverend O
Mr. O

fell O
in O
love O
with O
Miss O

being O
shot O
dead O
by O
a O
glance O

fired O
all O

pew O
to O
the O

This O
infatuated O
young O
man O
used O
sometimes O
to O
take O
tea O
with O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
presented O
by O
his O
mamma O
, O
and O
actually O
proposed O
something O
like O
marriage O
in O
an O
intercepted O
note O
, O
which O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
- O
eyed O
apple O

woman O
was O
charged O
to O
deliver O

Mrs. O
Crisp S-PERSON
was O
summoned O
from O
Buxton S-GPE
, O
and O
abruptly O
carried O
off O
her O
darling O
boy O

but O
the O
idea O
, O
even O
, O
of O
such O
an O
eagle O
in O
the O
Chiswick S-GPE
dovecot O
caused O
a O
great O
flutter O
in O
the O
breast O
of O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
, O
who O
would O
have O
sent O
away O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
but O
that O
she O
was O
bound O
to O
her O
under O
a O
forfeit O
, O
and O
who O
never O
could O
thoroughly O
believe O
the O
young O
lady’s O
protestations O
that O
she O
had O
never O
exchanged O
a O
single O
word O
with O
Mr. O
Crisp S-PERSON
, O
except O
under O
her O
own O
eyes O
on O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
occasions O
when O
she O
had O
met O
him O
at O
tea O

By O
the O
side O
of O
many O
tall O
and O
bouncing O
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
establishment O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp E-PERSON
looked O
like O
a O
child O
. O
But O
she O
had O
the O
dismal O
precocity O
of O
poverty O
. O
Many O
a O
dun O
had O
she O
talked O
to O
, O
and O
turned O
away O
from O
her O
father’s O
door O

many O
a O
tradesman O
had O
she O
coaxed O
and O
wheedled O
into O
goodhumour O
, O
and O
into O
the O
granting O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
meal O
more O
. O
She O
sate O
commonly O
with O
her O
father O
, O
who O
was O
very O
proud O
of O
her O
wit O
, O
and O
heard O
the O
talk O
of O
many O
of O
his O
wild O
companions O
— O
often O
but O
ill O
- O
suited O
for O
a O
girl O
to O
hear O
. O
But O
she O
never O
had O
been O
a O
girl O
, O
she O
said O

she O
had O
been O
a O
woman O
since O
she O
was O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE

O O
why O
did O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
let O
such O
a O
dangerous O
bird O
into O
her O
cage O
? O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
the O
old O
lady O
believed O
Rebecca S-PERSON
to O
be O
the O
meekest O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
, O
so O
admirably O

on O
the O
occasions O
when O
her O

brought O
her O

How O
the O

after O
the O

The O
catastrophe O

the O
prayers O

the O
walks O

which O
were O
arranged O
with O
a O
conventual O
regularity O

oppressed O
her O
almost O
beyond O
endurance O

she O
looked O
back O
to O
the O
freedom O

the O
beggary O
of O
the O
old O
studio O

so O
much O
regret O

grief O

had O
a O
little O
room O
in O
the O

where O
the O
maids O
heard O
her O
walking O

sobbing O
at O
night O

it O
was O
with O
rage O

conversation O
was O
a B-CARDINAL

the O

the O

the O
frigid O
correctness O
of O
the O

annoyed O
her O

she O
had O
no O

this O

sure O
that O
she O
showed O
Rebecca S-PERSON
over O
every O
room O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
everything O
in O
every O
one O
of O
her O
drawers O

and O
her O
books O
, O

her O

her O

all O
her O
necklaces O
, O
brooches O
, O
laces O
, O
and O
gimcracks O
. O
She O
insisted O
upon O
Rebecca S-PERSON
accepting O
the O
white O
cornelian O
and O
the O
turquoise O
rings O
, O
and O
a O
sweet O
sprigged O
muslin O
, O
which O
was O
too O
small O
for O
her O
, O
though O
it O
would O
fit O
her O
friend O
to O
a O
nicety O
| | O
and O
she O
determined O
in O
her O
heart O
to O
ask O
her O
mother’s O
permission O
to O
present O
her O
white O
Cashmere S-ORG
shawl O
to O
her O
friend O
. O
Could O
she O
not O
spare O
it O
? O
and O
had O
not O
her O
brother O
Joseph S-PERSON
just O
brought O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
from O
India S-GPE
? O
When O
Rebecca S-PERSON
saw O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
magnificent O
Cashmere S-ORG
shawls O
which O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
had O
brought O
home O
to O
his O
sister O
, O
she O
said O
, O
with O
perfect O
truth O
, O
“ O
that O
it O
must O
be O
delightful O
to O
have O
a O
brother O
, O
” O
and O
easily O
got O
the O
pity O
of O
the O
tender O
- O
hearted O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
for O
being O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
, O
an O
orphan O
without O
friends O
or O
kindred O
. O
“ O
Not O
alone O
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON

“ O
you O
know O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
I O
shall O
always O
be O
your O
friend O

and O
love O
you O
as O
a O
sister O
— O
indeed O
I O
will O
. O
” O
“ O
Ah O
, O
but O
to O
have O
parents O
, O
as O
you O
have O
— O
kind O

rich O
, O
affectionate O
parents O

who O
give O
you O
everything O
you O
ask O
for O

and O
their O
love O
, O
which O
is O
more O
precious O
than O
all O
! O
My O
poor O
papa O
could O
give O
me O
nothing O
, O
and O
I O
had O
but O
two S-CARDINAL
frocks O
in O
all O
the O
world O
! O
And O
then O
, O
to O
have O
a O
brother O

a O
dear O
brother O
! O
Oh O
, O
how O
you O
must O
love O
him O
! O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
laughed O
. O
“ O
What O
! O
don’t O
you O
love O
him O
? O
you O
, O
who O
say O
you O
love O
everybody O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
I O
do O
— O
only O
— O
” O
“ O
Only O
what O
? O
” O
“ O
Only O
Joseph S-PERSON
doesn’t O
seem O
to O
care O
much O
whether O
I O
love O
him O

not O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
two S-CARDINAL
fingers O
to O
shake O
when O
he O
arrived O
after O
ten B-DATE
years’ E-DATE
absence O
! O
He O
is O
very O
kind O
and O
good O
, O
but O
he O
scarcely O
ever O
speaks O
to O
me O
| | O
I O
think O
he O
loves O
his O
pipe O
a O
great O
deal O
better O
than O
his O
” O
… O
but O
here O
Amelia S-PERSON
checked O
herself O
, O
for O
why O
should O
she O
speak O
ill O
of O
her O
brother O
? O
“ O
He O
was O
very O
kind O
to O
me O
as O
a O
child O
, O
” O
she O
added O
| | O
“ O
I O
was O
but O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
when O
he O
went O
away O

” O
“ O
Isn’t O
he O
very O
rich O
? O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
They O
say O
all O
Indian S-NORP
nabobs O
are O
enormously O
rich O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
believe O
he O
has O
a O
very O
large O
income O
. O
” O
“ O
And O
is O
your O
sister O

in O
- O
law O
a O
nice O
pretty O
woman O
? O
” O
“ O
La O
! O
Joseph S-PERSON
is O
not O
married O
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
again O
. O
Perhaps O
she O
had O
mentioned O
the O
fact O
already O
to O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
but O
that O
young O
lady O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
remembered O
it O
| | O
indeed O
, O
vowed O
and O
protested O
that O
she O
expected O
to O
see O
a O
number O
of O
Amelia’s S-NORP
nephews O
and O
nieces O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
disappointed O
that O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
not O
married O
| | O
she O
was O
sure O
Amelia S-PERSON
had O
said O
he O
was O
, O
and O
she O
doted O
so O
on O
little O
children O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
you O
must O
have O
had O
enough O
of O
them O
at O
Chiswick S-GPE
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
rather O
wondering O
at O
the O
sudden O
tenderness O
on O
her O
friend’s O
part O
| | O
and O
indeed O
in O
later O
days O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
would O
never O
have O
committed O
herself O
so O
far O
as O
to O
advance O
opinions O
, O
the O
untruth O
of O
which O
would O
have O
been O
so O
easily O
detected O
. O
But O
we O
must O
remember O
that O
she O
is O
but O
nineteen S-DATE
as O
yet O
, O
unused O
to O
the O
art O
of O
deceiving O
, O
poor O
innocent O
creature O
! O
and O
making O
her O
own O
experience O
in O
her O
own O
person O
. O
The O
meaning O
of O
the O
above O
series O
of O
queries O
, O
as O
translated O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
this O
ingenious O
young O
woman O
, O
was O
simply O
this O
: O
— O
“ O
If O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
is O
rich O
and O
unmarried O
, O
why O
should O
I O
not O
marry O
him O
? O
I O
have O
only O
a O
fortnight O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
trying O
. O
” O
And O
she O
determined O
within O
herself O
to O
make O
this O
laudable O
attempt O
. O
She O
redoubled O
her O
caresses O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
| | O
she O
kissed O
the O
white O
cornelian O
necklace O
as O
she O
put O
it O
on O
| | O
and O
vowed O
she O
would O
never O
, O
never O
part O
with O
it O
. O
When O
the O
dinner O
- O
bell O
rang O
she O
went O
down O
stairs O
with O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
friend’s O
waist O
, O
as O
is O
the O
habit O
of O
young O
ladies O
. O
She O
was O
so O
agitated O
at O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
find O
courage O
to O
enter O
. O
“ O
Feel O
my O
heart O
, O
how O
it O
beats O
, O
dear O
! O
” O
said O
she O
to O
her O
friend O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
it O
doesn’t O
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Come O
in O
, O
don’t O
be O
frightened O

you O

in O
buckskins O

Hessian S-NORP
boots O

with O
several O
immense O
neckcloths O

that O
rose O
almost O
to O
his O
nose O

with O
a O
red O
striped O
waistcoat O
and O
an O
apple O
green O
coat O
with O
steel O
buttons O
almost O
as O
large O
as O
crown O
pieces O

( O

was O
the O
morning O
costume O
of O

dandy O

of O
those O
days O

was O
reading O
the O
paper O
by O
the O
fire O

the O
two S-CARDINAL
girls O
entered O
, O
and O
bounced O
off O
his O
arm O
- O
chair O
, O
and O
blushed O
excessively O
, O
and O
hid O
his O
entire O
face O
almost O
in O
his O
neckcloths O
at O
this O
apparition O
. O
“ O
It’s O
only O
your O
sister O
, O
Joseph S-PERSON

” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
and O
shaking O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
fingers O
which O
he O
held O
out O

“ O

“ O
No O

said O
the O
head O
under O
the O
neckcloth O

shaking O
very O
much O
, O
— O
“ O

what O
abominably O
cold O

— O

herewith O
he O
fell O
to O
poking O
the O
fire O
with O
all O
his O
might O

it O
was O
in O
the B-DATE

“ O
He’s O
very O
handsome O

whispered O
Rebecca S-PERSON
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
rather O
loud O
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
think O
so O

said O
the O
latter O

“ O

tell O
him O

” O
“ O
Darling S-PERSON

Miss O

, O
starting O
back O
as O
timid O
as O
a O
fawn O

She O
had O
previously O
made O
a O
respectful O
virgin O
- O
like O
curtsey O
to O
the O
gentleman O

her O
modest O
eyes O
gazed O
so O
perseveringly O
on O
the O
carpet O

it O
was O
a O
wonder O
how O
she O
should O
have O
found O
an O
opportunity O
to O
see O
him O

“ O
Thank O

for O
the O
beautiful O
shawls O

“ O

not O
beautiful O

“ O
O O
heavenly O

said O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON

and O
her O
eyes O
went O
from O
the O
carpet O
straight O
to O
the O
chandelier O
. O
Joseph S-PERSON
still O
continued O
a O
huge O
clattering O
at O
the O
poker O

tongs O
, O
puffing O
and O
blowing O
the O
while O
, O

turning O
as O
red O
as O
his O
yellow O
face O
would O
allow O
him O

“ O
I O

that O
article O

away O

At O

the O

rattling O
his O

true O
British S-NORP

out O

encountering O
the O

Miss O

stopped O
all O

him O

so O
Joseph S-PERSON
wrote O
home O
to O
his O
parents O
, O
when O
he O
took O
possession O
of O
his O
collectorship O
. O
He O
had O
lived O
for O
about B-DATE
eight I-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
his O
life O
, O
quite O
alone O
, O
at O
this O
charming O
place O
, O
scarcely O
seeing O
a O
Christian S-NORP
face O
except O
twice O
a O
year O
, O
when O
the O
detachment O
arrived O
to O
carry O
off O
the O
revenues O
which O
he O
had O
collected O
, O
to O
Calcutta S-GPE
. O
Luckily O
, O
at O
this O
time O
he O
caught O
a O
liver O
complaint O
, O
for O
the O
cure O
of O
which O
he O
returned O
to O
Europe S-LOC
, O
and O
which O
was O
the O
source O
of O
great O
comfort O
and O
amusement O
to O
him O
in O
his O
native O
country O
. O
He O
did O
not O
live O
with O
his O
family O
while O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
but O
had O
lodgings O
of O
his O
own O
, O
like O
a O
gay O
young O
bachelor O
. O
Before O
he O
went O
to O
India S-GPE
he O
was O
too O
young O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
delightful O
pleasures O
of O
a O
man O
about O
town O
, O
and O
plunged O
into O
them O
on O
his O
return O
with O
considerable O
assiduity O
. O
He O
drove O
his O
horses O
in O
the O
Park O
| | O
he O
dined O
at O
the O
fashionable O
taverns O
( O
for O
the B-ORG
Oriental I-ORG
Club E-ORG
was O
not O
as O
yet O
invented O
) O
| | O
he O
frequented O
the O
theatres O
, O
as O
the O
mode O
was O
in O
those O
days O
, O
or O
made O
his O
appearance O
at O
the O
opera O
, O
laboriously O
attired O
in O
tights O
and O
a O
cocked O
hat O
. O
On O
returning O
to O
India S-GPE
, O
and O
ever O
after O
, O
he O
used O
to O
talk O
of O
the O
pleasure O
of O
this O
period O
of O
his O
existence O
with O
great O
enthusiasm O
, O
and O
give O
you O
to O
understand O
that O
he O
and O
Brummel S-PERSON
were O
the O
leading O
bucks O
of O
the O
day O
. O
But O
he O
was O
as O
lonely O
here O
as O
in O
his O
jungle O
at O
Boggley B-FAC
Wollah E-FAC
. O
He O
scarcely O
knew O
a O
single O
soul O
in O
the O
metropolis O
: O
and O
were O
it O
not O
for O
his O
doctor O
, O
and O
the O
society O
of O
his O
blue O
- O
pill O
, O
and O
his O
liver O
complaint O
, O
he O
must O
have O
died O
of O
loneliness O
. O
He O
was O
lazy O
, O
peevish O
, O
and O
a O
bon-vivant O
| | O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
lady O
frightened O
him O
beyond O
measure O
| | O
hence O
it O
was O
but O
seldom O
that O
he O
joined O
the O
paternal O
circle O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
where O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
gaiety O
, O
and O
where O
the O
jokes O
of O
his O
good O
natured O
old O
father O
frightened O
his O
amour O
- O
propre O
. O
His O
bulk O
caused O
Joseph S-PERSON
much O
anxious O
thought O
and O
alarm O
| | O
now O
and O
then O
he O
would O
make O
a O
desperate O
attempt O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
his O
superabundant O
fat O
| | O
but O
his O
indolence O
and O
love O
of O
good O
living O
speedily O
got O
the O
better O
of O
these O
endeavours O
at O
reform O
, O
and O
he O
found O
himself O
again O
at O
his O
three S-CARDINAL
meals O
a O
day O
. O
he O
never O
was O
well O
dressed O
| | O
but O
he O
took O
the O
hugest O
pains O
to O
adorn O
his O
big O
person O
, O
and O
passed O
many B-TIME
hours E-TIME
daily O
in O
that O
occupation O
. O
His O
valet O
made O
a O
fortune O
out O
of O
his O
wardrobe O
: O
his O
toilet O
- O
table O
was O
covered O
with O
as O
many O
pomatums O
and O
essences O
as O
ever O
were O
employed O
by O
an O
old O
beauty O
: O
he O
had O
tried O
, O
in O
order O
to O
give O
himself O
a O
waist O
, O
every O
girth O
, O
stay O
, O
and O
waistband O
then O
invented O
. O
Like O
most O
fat O
men O
, O
he O
would O
have O
his O
clothes O
made O
too O
tight O
, O
and O
took O
care O
they O
should O
be O
of O
the O
most O
brilliant O
colours O
and O
youthful O
cut O
. O
When O
dressed O
at O
length O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
he O
would O
issue O
forth O
to O
take O
a O
drive O
with O
nobody O
in O
the O
Park O
| | O
and O
then O
would O
come O
back O
in O
order O
to O
dress O
again O
and O
go O
and O
dine O
with O
nobody O
at O
the B-FAC
Piazza I-FAC
Coffee I-FAC
- I-FAC
House E-FAC
. O
He O
was O
as O
vain O
as O
a O
girl O
| | O
and O
perhaps O
his O
extreme O
shyness O
was O
one O
of O
the O
results O
of O
his O
extreme O
vanity O
. O
If O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
can O
get O
the O
better O
of O
him O
, O
and O
at O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
entrance O
into O
life O
, O
she O
is O
a O
young O
person O
of O
no O
ordinary O
cleverness O
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
move O
showed O
considerable O
skill O
. O
When O
she O
called O
Sedley S-PERSON
a O
very O
handsome O
man O
, O
she O
knew O
that O
Amelia S-PERSON
would O
tell O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
would O
probably O
tell O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
or O
who O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
would O
be O
pleased O
by O
the O
compliment O
paid O
to O
her O
son O
. O
All O
mothers O
are O
. O
If O
you O
had O
told O
Sycorax S-PERSON
that O
her O
son O
Caliban S-PERSON
was O
as O
handsome O
as O
Apollo S-PERSON
, O
she O
would O
have O
been O
pleased O
, O
witch O
as O
she O
was O
. O
Perhaps O
, O
too O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
would O
overhear O
the O
compliment O
— O
Rebecca S-PERSON
spoke O
loud O
enough O
— O
and O
he O
did O
hear O
, O
and O
( O
thinking O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
he O
was O
a O
very O
fine O
man O
) O
, O
the O
praise O
thrilled O
through O
every O
fibre O
of O
his O
big O
body O
, O
and O
made O
it O
tingle O
with O
pleasure O
. O
Then O
, O
however O
, O
came O
a O
recoil O
. O
“ O
Is O
the O
girl O
making O
fun O
of O
me O
? O
” O
he O
thought O
, O
and O
straightway O
he O
bounced O
towards O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
was O
for O
retreating O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
when O
his O
father’s O
jokes O
and O
his O
mother’s O
entreaties O
caused O
him O
to O
pause O
and O
stay O
where O
he O
was O
. O
He O
conducted O
the O
young O
lady O
down O
to O
dinner O
in O
a O
dubious O
and O
agitated O
frame O
of O
mind O
. O
“ O
Does O
she O
really O
think O
I O
am O
handsome O
? O
” O
thought O
he O
, O
“ O
or O
is O
she O
only O
making O
game O
of O
me O
? O
” O
We O
have O
talked O
of O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
being O
as O
vain O
as O
a O
girl O
. O
Heaven O
help O
us O
! O
the O
girls O
have O
only O
to O
turn O
the O
tables O
, O
and O
say O
of O
one O
of O
their O
own O
sex O
, O
“ O
She O
is O
as O
vain O
as O
a O
man O
, O
” O
and O
they O
will O
have O
perfect O
reason O
. O
The O
bearded O
creatures O
are O
quite O
as O
eager O
for O
praise O
, O
quite O
as O
finikin O
over O
their O
toilets O
, O
quite O
as O
proud O
of O
their O
personal O
advantages O
, O
quite O
as O
conscious O
of O
their O
powers O
of O
fascination O
, O
as O
any O
coquette O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Down O
stairs O
, O
then O
, O
they O
went O
, O
Joseph S-PERSON
very O
red O
and O
blushing O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
very O
modest O
, O
and O
holding O
her O
green O
eyes O
downwards O
. O
She O
was O
dressed O
in O
white O
, O
with O
bare O
shoulders O
as O
white O
as O
snow O
— O
the O
picture O
of O
youth O
, O
unprotected O
innocence O
, O
and O
humble O
virgin O
simplicity O
. O
“ O
I O
must O
be O
very O
quiet O
, O
” O
thought O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
“ O
and O
very O
much O
interested O
about O
India S-GPE
. O
” O
Now O
we O
have O
heard O
how O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
had O
prepared O
a O
fine O
curry O
for O
her O
son O
, O
just O
as O
he O
liked O
it O
, O
and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
dinner O
a O
portion O
of O
this O
dish O
was O
offered O
to O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
What O
is O
it O
? O
” O
said O
she O
, O
turning O
an O
appealing O
look O
to O
Mr. O
Joseph S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Capital O
, O
” O
said O
he O
. O
His O
mouth O
was O
full O
of O
it O
| | O
his O
face O
quite O
red O
with O
the O
delightful O
exercise O
of O
gobbling O
. O
“ O
Mother O
, O
it’s O
as O
good O
as O
my O
own O
curries O
in O
India S-GPE
. O
” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
I O
must O
try O
some O
, O
if O
it O
is O
an O
Indian S-NORP
dish O
, O
” O
said O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
am O
sure O
everything O
must O
be O
good O
that O
comes O
from O
there O
. O
” O
“ O
Give O
Miss O
Sharp O
some O
curry O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
” O
said O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
never O
tasted O
the O
dish O
before O
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
find O
it O
as O
good O
as O
everything O
else O
from O
India S-GPE
? O
” O
said O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
excellent O
! O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
suffering O
tortures O
with O
the O
cayenne O
pepper O
. O
“ O
Try O
a O
chili O
with O
it O
, O
Miss O

, O
” O
said O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
really O
interested O
. O
“ O
A O
chili O
, O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
gasping O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
” O
She O
thought O
a O
chili O
was O
something O
cool O
, O
as O
its O
name O
imported O
, O
and O
was O
served O
with O
some O
. O
“ O
How O
fresh O
and O
green O
they O
look O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
and O
put O
one O
into O
her O
mouth O
. O
It O
was O
hotter O
than O
the O
curry O
| | O
flesh O
and O
blood O
could O
bear O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
She O
laid O
down O
her O
fork O
. O
“ O
Water O
, O
for O
Heaven’s O
sake O
, O
water O
! O
” O
she O
cried O
. O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
burst O
out O
laughing O
( O
he O
was O
a O
coarse O
man O
, O
from O

“ O

The O
paternal O
laugh O
was O
echoed O
by O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
who O
thought O
the O
joke O
capital O

The O
ladies O
only O
smiled O
a O
little O
. O
They O
thought O
poor O
Rebecca S-PERSON
suffered O
too O
much O
. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
choke O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
swallowed O
her O
mortification O
as O
well O
as O
she O
had O
the O
abominable O
curry O
before O
it O

as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
speak O

Old O

to O

thought O

a O
good O

simply O
said O

down O
again O

down O

indisputable O
correctness O

poor O

all O
this O
work O
to O

it O
is O
that O

” O
And O
she O
turned O
away O
her O
head O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
began O
to O
give O
way O
to O
that O
natural O
infirmity O
of O
tears O
which O
, O
we O
have O
said O
, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
defects O
of O
this O
silly O
little O
thing O
. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
looked O
at O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
women O
with O
a O
touched O
curiosity O

and O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
heaved O
something O
very O
like O
a O
sigh O
out O
of O
his O
big O
chest O
, O
as O
he O
cast O
his O
eyes O
down O
towards O
his O
favourite O
Hessian S-NORP
boots O
. O
“ O
Let O
us O
have O
some O
music O
, O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
— O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
George S-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
at O
that O
moment O
an O
extraordinary O
, O
almost O
irresistible O
impulse O
to O
seize O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
young O
woman O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
to O
kiss O
her O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
company O

and O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
if O
I O
should O
say O
that O
they O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
each O
other O
at O
that O
single O
instant O
of O
time O
, O
I O
should O
perhaps O
be O
telling O
an O
untruth O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
people O
had O
been O
bred O
up O
by O
their O
parents O
for O
this O
very O
purpose O
, O
and O
their O
banns O
had O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
been O
read O
in O
their O
respective O
families O
any O
time O
these B-DATE
ten I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
They O
went O
off O
to O
the O
piano O
, O
which O
was O
situated O
, O
as O
pianos O
usually O
are O
, O
in O
the O
back O
drawing O
- O
room O

and O
as O
it O
was O
rather O
dark O
, O
Miss O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
most O
unaffected O
way O
in O
the O
world O
, O
put O
her O
hand O
into O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
of O
course O
, O
could O
see O
the O
way O
among O
the O
chairs O
and O
ottomans O
a O
great O
deal O
better O
than O
she O
could O
. O
But O
this O
arrangement O
left O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON

Rebecca S-PERSON

at O
the O
drawing O

, O
where O
the O
latter O
was O
occupied O
in O
knitting O
a O
green O
silk O
purse O
. O
“ O
There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
ask O
family O
secrets O

” O
said O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Those O
two S-CARDINAL
have O
told O
theirs O

” O
“ O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
gets O
his O
company O
, O
” O
said O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
“ O
I O
believe O
the O

“ O

“ O
Happy O
the O
man O
who O
wins O
her O
! O
” O
With O
this O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
gave O
a O
great O
sigh O
. O
When O
two S-CARDINAL
unmarried O
persons O
get O
together O
, O
and O
talk O
upon O
such O
delicate O
subjects O

the O
present O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
confidence O
and O
intimacy O
is O
presently O
established O
between O
them O
. O
There O
is O
no O
need O
of O
giving O
a O
special O
report O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
which O
now O
took O
place O
between O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
and O
the O
young O
lady O
| | O
for O
the O
conversation O
, O
as O
may O
be O
judged O
from O
the O
foregoing O
specimen O
, O
was O
not O
especially O
witty O
or O
eloquent O

it O
seldom O
is O
in O
private O
societies O

any O
where O
except O
in O
very O
high O
- O
flown O

ingenious O
novels O

As O
there O
was O
music O
in O
the O
next O
room O
, O
the O
talk O
was O
carried O
on O
, O
of O
course O
, O
in O
a O
low O
and O
becoming O
tone O
, O
though O
, O
for O
the O
matter O
of O
that O
, O
the O
couple O
in O
the O
next O
apartment O
would O
not O
have O
been O
disturbed O

the O
talking O
been O
so O
loud O
, O
so O
occupied O
were O
they O
with O
their O
own O
pursuits O
. O
Almost O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
life O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
found O
himself O
talking O
, O
without O
the O
least O
timidity O
or O
hesitation O
, O
to O
a O
person O
of O
the O
other O
sex O
. O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
asked O
him O
a O
great O
number O
of O
questions O
about O
India S-GPE
, O
which O
gave O
him O
an O
opportunity O
of O
narrating O
many O
interesting O
anecdotes O
about O
that O
country O
and O
himself O
. O
He O
described O
the O
balls O
at O
Government B-ORG
House E-ORG
, O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
they O
kept O
themselves O
cool O
in O
the O
hot O
weather O
, O
with O
punkahs O
, O
tatties O
, O
and O
other O
contrivances O

and O
he O
was O
very O
witty O
regarding O
the O
number O
of O
Scotchmen S-NORP
whom O
Lord O
Minto S-PERSON
, O
the O
Governor O
- O
General O
, O
patronised O
| | O
and O
then O
he O
described O
a O
tiger O
- O
hunt O
| | O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
mahout O
of O
his O
elephant O
had O
been O
pulled O
off O
his O
seat O
by O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
infuriated O
animals O
. O
How O
delighted O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
at O
the O
Government O
balls O
, O
and O
how O
she O
laughed O
at O
the O
stories O
of O
the O
Scotch S-NORP
aides O
- O
de O
- O
camp O
, O
and O
called O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
a O
sad O
wicked O
satirical O
creature O
| | O
and O
how O
frightened O
she O
was O
at O
the O
story O
of O
the O
elephant O
! O
“ O
For O
your O
mother’s O
sake O
, O
dear O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
all O
your O
friends O
, O
promise O
never O
to O
go O
on O
one O
of O
those O
horrid O
expeditions O
. O
” O
“ O
Pooh S-PERSON
, O
pooh O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
he O
pulling O
up O
his O
shirtcollars O
| | O
“ O
the O
danger O
makes O
the O
sport O
only O
the O
pleasanter O
. O
” O
He O
had O
never O
been O
but O
once O
at O
a O
tiger O
- O
hunt O
, O
when O
the O
accident O
in O
question O
occurred O
, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
half S-CARDINAL
killed O
— O
not O
by O
the O
tiger O
, O
but O
by O
the O
fright O
. O
And O
as O
he O
talked O
on O
, O
he O
grew O
quite O
bold O
, O
and O
actually O
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
ask O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
for O
whom O
she O
was O
knitting O
the O
green O
silk O
purse O
? O
He O
was O
quite O
surprised O
and O
delighted O
at O
his O
own O
graceful O
familiar O
manner O
. O
“ O
For O
any O
one O
who O
wants O
a O
purse O
, O
” O
replied O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
him O
in O
the O
most O
gentle O
winning O
way O
. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
going O
to O
make O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
eloquent O
speeches O
possible O
, O
and O
had O
begun O
— O
“ O
O B-WORK_OF_ART
Miss I-WORK_OF_ART
Sharp E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
how O
— O
— O
” O
when O
some O
song O
which O
was O
performed O
in O
the O
other O
room O
came O
to O
an O
end O
, O
and O
caused O
him O
to O
hear O
his O
own O
voice O
so O
distinctly O
that O
he O
stopped O
, O
blushed O
, O
and O
blew O
his O
nose O
in O
great O
agitation O
. O
“ O
Did O
you O
ever O
hear O
anything O
like O
your O
brother’s O
eloquence O
? O
” O
whispered O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
your O
friend O
has O
worked O
miracles O
. O
” O
“ O
The O
more O
the O
better O
, O
” O
said O
Miss O
Amelia S-PERSON

who O
, O
like O
almost O
all O
women O
who O
are O
worth O
a O
pin O
, O
was O
a O
match O
- O
maker O
in O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
delighted O
that O
Joseph S-PERSON
should O
carry O
back O
a O
wife O
to O
India S-GPE
. O
She O
had O
, O
too O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
few O
days’ O
constant O
intercourse O
, O
warmed O
into O
a O
most O
tender O
friendship O
for O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
and O
discovered O
a O
million S-CARDINAL
of O
virtues O
and O
amiable O
qualities O
in O
her O
which O
she O
had O
not O
perceived O
when O
they O
were O
at O
Chiswick S-GPE
together O
. O
For O
the O
affection O
of O
young O
ladies O
is O
of O
as O
rapid O
growth O
as O
Jack’s O
beanstalk O
, O
and O
reaches O
up O
to O
the O
sky O
in O
a O
night O
. O
It O
is O
no O
blame O
to O
them O
that O
after O
marriage O
this O
Sehnsucht B-WORK_OF_ART
nach I-WORK_OF_ART

subsides O
. O
It O
is O
what O
sentimentalists O
, O
who O
deal O
in O
very O
big O
words O
, O
call O
a O
yearning O
after O
the O
Ideal O
, O
and O
simply O
means O
that O
women O
are O
commonly O
not O
satisfied O
until O
they O
have O
husbands O
and O
children O
on O
whom O
they O
may O
centre O
affections O
, O
which O
are O
spent O
elsewhere O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
small O
change O

Having O
expended O
her O
little O
store O
of O
songs O

having O
stayed O
long O
enough O
in O
the O
back O
drawing O

room O
, O
it O
now O
appeared O
proper O
to O
Miss O
Amelia S-PERSON
to O
ask O
her O
friend O
to O
sing O
. O
“ O
You O
would O
not O
have O
listened O
to O
me O
, O
” O
she O
said O
to O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
( O
though O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
telling O
a O
fib O
) O
, O
“ O
had O
you O
heard O
Rebecca S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL

” O
“ O
I O
give O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
warning O
, O
though O
, O
” O
said O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
“ O
that O
, O
right O

wrong O

I O
consider O

“ O
You O
shall O
hear O

said O
Amelia S-PERSON

and O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
was O
actually O
polite O
enough O
to O
carry O
the O
candles O
to O
the O
piano O
. O
Osborne S-PERSON
hinted O
that O
he O
should O
like O
quite O
as O
well O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
dark O

but O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
declined O
to O
bear O
him O
company O
any O
farther O
, O
and O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
accordingly O
followed O
Mr. O
Joseph S-PERSON
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
sang O
far O
better O
than O
her O
friend O
( O
though O
of O
course O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
free O
to O
keep O
his O
opinion O
) O
and O
exerted O
herself O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
the O
wonder O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
never O
known O
her O
perform O
so O
well O
. O
She O
sang O
a O
French S-NORP
song O
, O
which O
Joseph S-PERSON
did O
not O
understand O
in O
the O
least O
, O
and O
which O
George S-PERSON
confessed O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
, O
and O
then O
a O
number O
of O
those O
simple O
ballads O

were O
the O
fashion O
forty B-DATE

to O
the O

Ah O

Ah O

The O

An O
orphan O

And O

the O
midnight O

And O
doubly O
cold O

With O
fainting O
heart O
and O
weary O
limb O

Kind O
voices O
bade O
him O

Hark O
to O
the O

It O
was O
the O
sentiment O
of O
the O
before O

mentioned O
words O
, O
“ O
When O

over O

As O

to O
the O

, O
Miss O
Sharp’s S-PERSON
“ O

Everybody O
felt O
the O
allusion O

and O
to O
her O
hapless O
orphan O
state O
. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
fond O
of O
music O
, O
and O
softhearted O
, O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
ravishment O
during O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
song O
, O
and O
profoundly O
touched O
at O
its O
conclusion O
. O
If O
he O
had O
had O
the O
courage O

if O
George S-PERSON

Miss O

had O
remained O
, O
according O
to O
the O
former’s O
proposal O
, O
in O
the O
farther O
room O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley’s E-PERSON
bachelorhood O
would O
have O
been O
at O
an O
end O
, O
and O
this O
work O
would O
never O
have O
been O
written O
. O
But O
at O
the O
close O
of O
the O
ditty O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
quitted O
the O
piano O
, O
and O
giving O
her O
hand O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
walked O
away O
into O
the O
front O
drawingroom O
twilight O
| | O
and O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
Mr. O
Sambo S-PERSON
made O
his O
appearance O
with O
a O
tray O
, O
containing O
sandwiches O
, O
jellies O
, O
and O
some O
glittering O
glasses O
and O
decanters O
, O
on O
which O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley’s E-PERSON
attention O
was O
immediately O
fixed O
. O
When O
the O
parents O
of O
the O
house O
of O
Sedley S-PERSON
returned O
from O
their O
dinner O
- O
party O
, O
they O
found O
the O
young O
people O
so O
busy O
in O
talking O
, O
that O
they O
had O
not O
heard O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Joseph S-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
saying O
, O
“ O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
one O
little O
teaspoonful O
of O

” O
“ O
Bravo B-WORK_OF_ART

” O
said O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON

on O
hearing O
the O
bantering O
of O
which O
well O
- O
known O
voice O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
instantly O
relapsed O
into O
an O
alarmed O
silence O
, O
and O
quickly O
took O
his O
departure O
. O
He O
did O
not O
lie O
awake O
all O
night O
thinking O
whether O
or O
not O
he O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
| | O
the O
passion O
of O
love O
never O
interfered O
with O
the O
appetite O
or O
the O
slumber O
of O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
| | O
but O
he O
thought O
to O
himself O
how O
delightful O
it O
would O
be O
to O
hear O
such O
songs O
as O
those O
after O
Cutcherry S-PERSON
— O
what O
a O
distinguée O
girl O
she O
was O
— O
how O
she O
could O
speak O
French S-LANGUAGE
better O
than O
the O
Governor O
General’s S-PERSON
lady O
herself O
— O
and O
what O
a O
sensation O
she O
would O
make O
at O
the O
Calcutta S-GPE
balls O
. O
“ O
It’s O
evident O
the O
poor O
devil’s O
in O
love O
with O
me O
, O
” O
thought O
he O
. O
“ O
She O
is O
just O
as O
rich O
as O
most O
of O
the O
girls O
who O
come O
out O
to O
India S-GPE
. O
I O
might O
go O
farther O
, O
and O
fare O
worse O
, O
egad O
! O
” O
And O
in O
these O
meditations O
he O
fell O
asleep O
. O
How O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
lay O
awake O
, O
thinking O
, O
will O
he O
come O
or O
not O
to O
- O
morrow O
? O
need O
not O
be O
told O
here O
. O
To O
- O
morrow O
came O
, O
and O
, O
as O
sure O
as O
fate O
, O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
made O
his O
appearance O
before O
luncheon O
. O
He O
had O
never O
been O
known O
to O
confer O
such O
an O
honour O
on O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
was O
somehow O
there O
already O
( O
sadly O
“ O
putting O
out O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
writing O
to O
her O
twelve S-CARDINAL
dearest O
friends O
at O
Chiswick B-FAC
Mall E-FAC
) O
, O
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
employed O
upon O
her O
yesterday’s O
work O
. O
As O
Joe’s S-PERSON
buggy O
drove O
up O
, O
and O
while O
, O
after O
his O
usual O
thundering O
knock O
and O
pompous O
bustle O
at O
the O
door O
, O
the O
ex-Collector O
of O
Boggley B-PERSON
Wollah E-PERSON
laboured O
upstairs O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
knowing O
glances O
were O
telegraphed O
between O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
pair O
, O
smiling O
archly O
, O
looked O
at O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
who O
actually O
blushed O
as O
she O
bent O
her O
fair O
ringlets O
over O
her O
knitting O
. O
How O
her O
heart O
beat O
as O
Joseph S-PERSON
appeared O
, O
— O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
puffing O
from O
the O
staircase O
in O
shining O
creaking O
boots O
, O
— O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
new O
waistcoat O
red O
with O
heat O
and O
nervousness O
, O
and O
blushing O
behind O
his O
wadded O
neck O
- O
cloth O
. O
It O
was O
a O
nervous O
moment O
for O
all O
| | O
and O
as O
for O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
she O
was O
more O
frightened O
than O
even O
the O
people O
most O
concerned O
. O
Sambo S-PERSON
, O
who O
flung O
open O
the O
door O
and O
announced O
Mr. O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
followed O
grinning O
, O
in O
the O
Collector’s S-FAC
rear O
, O
and O
bearing O
two S-CARDINAL
handsome O
nosegays O
of O
flowers O
, O
which O
the O
monster O
had O
actually O
had O
the O
gallantry O
to O
purchase O
in O
Covent B-FAC
Garden I-FAC
Market E-FAC
that O
morning O
— O
they O
were O
not O
as O
big O
as O
the O
haystacks O
which O
ladies O
carry O
about O
with O
them O
now O
- O
a O
- O
days O
, O
in O
cones O
of O
filigree O
paper O
| | O
but O
the O
young O
women O
were O
delighted O
with O
the O
gift O
, O
as O
Joseph S-PERSON
presented O
one O
to O
each O
, O
with O
an O
exceedingly O
solemn O
bow O
. O
“ O
Bravo S-PERSON
, O
Jos S-PERSON
! O
” O
cried O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Thank O
you O
, O
dear O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
quite O
ready O
to O
kiss O
her O
brother O
, O
if O
he O
were O
so O
minded O
. O
( O
And O
I O
think O
for O
a O
kiss O
from O
such O
a O
dear O
creature O
as O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
I O
would O
purchase O
all O
Mr. O
Lee’s S-PERSON
conservatories O
out O
of O
hand O
. O
) O
“ O
O O
heavenly O
, O
heavenly O
flowers O
! O
” O
exclaimed O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
and O
smelt O
them O
delicately O
, O
and O
held O
them O
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
and O
cast O
up O
her O
eyes O
to O
the O
ceiling O
, O
in O
an O
ecstasy O
of O
admiration O
. O
Perhaps O
she O
just O
looked O
first S-ORDINAL
into O
the O
bouquet O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
billet O
- O
doux O
hidden O
among O
the O
flowers O
| | O
but O
there O
was O
no O
letter O
. O
“ O
Do O
they O
talk O
the O
language O
of O
flowers O
at O
Boggley B-PERSON
Wollah E-PERSON
, O
Sedley S-PERSON
? O
” O
asked O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
. O
“ O
Pooh S-PERSON
, O
nonsense O
! O
” O
replied O
the O
sentimental O
youth O
. O
“ O
Bought O
em O
at O
Nathan’s O

very O
glad O

eh O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
bought O
a O
pine O
- O
apple O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
which O
I O
gave O
to O
Sambo S-PERSON

have O
it O
for O

very O
cool O
and O
nice O
this O
hot O
weather O

” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
she O
had O
never O
tasted O
a O
pine O
, O
and O
longed O
beyond O
everything O
to O
taste O
one O
. O
So O
the O
conversation O
went O
on O
. O
I O
don’t O
know O
on O
what O
pretext O
Osborne S-PERSON
left O
the O
room O
, O
or O
why O
, O
presently O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
went O
away O
, O
perhaps O
to O
superintend O
the O
slicing O
of O
the O
pine O
- O
apple O
| | O
but O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
left O
alone O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
resumed O
her O
work O
, O
and O
the O
green O
silk O
and O
the O
shining O
needles O
were O
quivering O
rapidly O
under O
her O
white O
slender O
fingers O
. O
“ O

a O
tour O

when O
shrill O
cries O
, O
as O
of O
a O
little O
fellow O
weeping O
, O
woke O
up O
his O
pleasant O
reverie O

and O
looking O
up O
, O
he O
saw O
Cuff S-PERSON
before O
him O
, O
belabouring O
a O
little O
boy O
. O
It O
was O
the O
lad O
who O
had O
peached O
upon O
him O
about O
the O
grocer’s O
cart O

but O
he O
bore O
little O
malice O
, O
not O
at O
least O
towards O
the O
young O
and O
small O
. O
“ O
How O
dare O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
break O
the O
bottle O
? O
” O
says O
Cuff S-PERSON
to O
the O
little O
urchin O
, O
swinging O
a O
yellow O
cricketstump O
over O
him O
. O
The O
boy O
had O
been O
instructed O
to O
get O
over O
the O
play O

ground O
wall O

to O
clamber O
back O
into O
the O
playground O
again O

during O
the O
performance O
of O
which O
feat O
, O
his O
foot O
had O
slipt O
, O
and O
the O
bottle O
was O
broken O
, O
and O
the O
shrub O
had O
been O
spilt O
, O
and O
his O
pantaloons O
had O
been O
damaged O
, O
and O
he O
appeared O
before O
his O
employer O
a O
perfectly O
guilty O
and O
trembling O
, O
though O
harmless O
, O
wretch O
. O
“ O
How O
dare O
you O
, O
sir O

break O
it O
? O
” O
says O
Cuff S-PERSON

“ O
you O
blundering O
little O

You O

Down O

the O

with O
a O
great O
heavy O
thump O
on O
the O
child’s O
hand O

A O
moan O
followed O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
looked O
up O
. O
The B-PERSON

Peribanou E-PERSON

fled O
into O
the O

there O
was O
every O

honest O
William S-PERSON

and O
a O
big O

beating O
a O

“ O
Hold O
out O

” O
roars O
Cuff O
to O
his O
little O
school O
- O
fellow O
, O
whose O
face O
was O
distorted O
with O
pain O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
quivered O
, O
and O
gathered O
himself O
up O
in O
his O
narrow O
old O
clothes O
. O
“ O
Take O
that O
, O
you O
little O
devil O

” O
cried O
Mr. O
Cuff S-PERSON
to O
his O
down O
came O
the O
wicket O
again O
on O
the O
child’s O

Don’t O

horrified O

ladies O

every O

a O
public O

Your O

so O
do O

be O
done O
by O

in O
all O

Down O
came O
the O
wicket O
again O

and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
started O
up O
. O
I O
can’t O
tell O
what O
his O
motive O
was O
. O
Torture O
in O
a O
public O
school O
is O
as O
much O
licensed O
as O
the O
knout O
in O
Russia S-GPE
. O
It O
would O
me O
ungentlemanlike O
( O
in O
a O
manner O
) O
to O
resist O
it O
. O
Perhaps O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
foolish O
soul O
revolted O
against O
that O
exercise O
of O
tyranny O
| | O
or O
perhaps O
he O
had O
a O
hankering O
feeling O
of O
revenge O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
longed O
to O
measure O
himself O
against O
that O
splendid O
bully O
and O
tyrant O
, O
who O
had O
all O
the O
glory O
, O
pride O
, O
pomp O
, O
circumstance O
, O
banners O
flying O

beating O
, O
guards O
saluting O
in O
the O
place O

Whatever O
may O
have O
been O
his O
incentive O
, O
however O
, O
up O
he O
sprang O
, O
and O
screamed O
out O
, O
“ O
Hold O
off O
, O
Cuff S-PERSON

don’t O
bully O
that O
child O
any O

I’ll O

” O
“ O
Or O
you’ll O
what O
? O
” O
Cuff S-PERSON
asked O
in O
amazement O
at O
this O
interruption O
. O
“ O
Hold O
out O
your O

you O

” O
“ O
I’ll O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
thrashing O
you O
ever O
had O
in O
your O
life O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
part O
of O
Cuff’s S-PERSON
sentence O
| | O
and O
little O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
gasping O
and O
in O
tears O
, O
looked O
up O
with O
wonder O
and O
incredulity O
at O
seeing O
this O
amazing O
champion O
put O
up O
suddenly O
to O
defend O
him O
: O
while O
Cuff’s O
astonishment O
was O
scarcely O
less O
. O
Fancy O
our O
late O
monarch O
George B-PERSON
III E-PERSON
. O
when O
he O
heard O
of O
the O
revolt O
of O
the O
North B-NORP
American E-NORP
colonies O
: O
fancy O
brazen O
Goliath S-PERSON
when O
little O
David S-PERSON
stepped O
forward O
and O
claimed O
a O
meeting O

and O
you O
have O
the O
feelings O
of O
Mr. O
Reginald B-PERSON
Cuff E-PERSON
when O
this O
rencontre O
was O
proposed O
to O
him O
. O
“ O
After O
school O
, O
” O
says O
he O
, O
of O
course O

after O
a O
pause O
and O
a O
look O

as O
much O
as O
to O

, O
“ O

your O

“ O
As O
you O

“ O

” O
“ O
Well O

if O
you O
like O

” O
little O
Osborne S-PERSON
replied O

for O
you O
see O
his O
papa O
kept O
a O
carriage O
, O
and O
he O
was O
rather O
ashamed O
of O
his O
champion O
. O
Yes O
, O
when O
the O
hour O
of O
battle O
came O
, O
he O
was O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
, O
“ O
Go O
it O
, O
Figs O
| | O
” O
and O
not O
a O
single O
other O
boy O
in O
the O
place O
uttered O
that O
cry O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
rounds O
of O
this O
famous O
combat O
| | O
at O
the O
commencement O
of O
which O
the O
scientific O
Cuff S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
contemptuous O
smile O
on O
his O
face O
, O
and O
as O
light O
and O
as O
gay O
as O
if O
he O
was O
at O
a O
ball O
, O
planted O
his O
blows O
upon O
his O
adversary O
, O
and O
floored O
that O
unlucky O
champion O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
running O
. O
At O
each O
fall O
there O
was O
a O
cheer O

and O
everybody O
was O
anxious O
to O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
offering O
the O
conqueror O
a O
knee O
. O
“ O
What O
a O
licking O
I O
shall O
get O
when O
it’s O
over O
, O
” O
young O
Osborne S-PERSON
thought O
, O
picking O
up O
his O
man O
. O
“ O
You’d O
best O
give O
in O
, O
” O
he O
said O
to O
Dobbin S-PERSON

“ O
it’s O
only O
a O
thrashing O
, O
Figs O
, O
and O
you O
know O
I’m O
used O
to O
it O

” O
But O
Figs O
, O
all O
whose O
limbs O
were O
in O
a O
quiver O
, O
and O
whose O
nostrils O
were O
breathing O
rage O
, O
put O
his O
little O
bottleholder O
aside O
, O
and O
went O
in O
for O
a O
fourth S-ORDINAL
time O
. O
As O
he O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
know O
how O
to O
parry O
the O
blows O
that O
were O
aimed O
at O
himself O
, O
and O
Cuff S-PERSON
had O
begun O
the O
attack O
on O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
preceding O
occasions O
, O
without O
ever O
allowing O
his O
enemy O
to O
strike O
, O
Figs S-ORG
now O
determined O
that O
he O
would O
commence O
the O
engagement O
by O
a O
charge O
on O
his O
own O
part O
| | O
and O
accordingly O
, O
being O
a O
left O
- O
handed O
man O
, O
brought O
that O
arm O
into O
action O
, O
and O
hit O
out O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
with O
all O
his O
might O
— O
once O
at O
Mr. O
Cuff’s S-PERSON
left O
eye O
, O
and O
once O
on O
his O
beautiful O
Roman S-NORP
nose O
. O
Cuff S-PERSON
went O
down O
this O
time O
, O
to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
the O
assembly O
. O
“ O
Well O
hit O
, O
by O
Jove S-PERSON
, O
” O
says O
little O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
connoisseur O
, O
clapping O
his O
man O
on O
the O
back O
. O
“ O
Give O
it O
him O
with O
the O
left O
, O
Figs O
my O
boy O

” O
Figs’s S-PERSON
left O
made O
terrific O
play O
during O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
combat O
. O
Cuff O
went O
down O
every O
time O
. O
At O
the O
sixth S-ORDINAL
round O
, O
there O
were O
almost O
as O
many O
fellows O
shouting O
out O
, O
“ O
Go O
it O
, O
Figs O
, O
” O
as O
there O
were O
youth O
exclaiming O
, O
“ O
Go O
it O
, O
Cuff S-PERSON
. O
” O
At O
the O
twelfth S-ORDINAL
round O
the O
latter O
champion O
was O
all O
aboard O
, O
as O
the O
saying O
is O
, O
and O
had O
lost O
all O
presence O
of O
mind O

power O
of O
attack O

defence O

Figs O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
was O
as O
calm O
as O

His O
face O
being O
quite O
pale O
, O
his O
eyes O
shining O
open O
, O
and O
a O
great O
cut O
on O
his O
under O
lip O
bleeding O
profusely O
, O
gave O
this O
young O
fellow O
a O
fierce O
and O
ghastly O
air O
, O
which O
perhaps O
struck O
terror O
into O
many O
spectators O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
his O
intrepid O
adversary O
prepared O
to O
close O
for O
the O
thirteenth S-ORDINAL
time O
. O
If O
I O

the O
pen O
of O
a O
Napier S-PERSON
, O
or O
a O
Bell’s O

I O
should O
like O
to O
describe O
this O
combat O
properly O

It O
was O
the O
last O
charge O
of O
the O
Guard S-ORG

( O
that O

it O
would O
have O
been O

only O
Waterloo S-GPE

not O
yet O
taken O
place O

— O
it O
was O
Ney’s S-PERSON
column O
breasting O
the O
hill O
of O
La B-FAC
Haye I-FAC
Sainte E-FAC
, O
bristling O
with O
ten B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
bayonets O
, O
and O
crowned O
with O
twenty S-CARDINAL
eagles O
— O
it O
was O
the O
shout O
of O
the O
beef O
- O
eating O
British S-NORP
, O
as O
leaping O
down O
the O
hill O
they O
rushed O
to O
hug O
the O
enemy O

the O
savage O
arms O
of O
battle O

in O
other O
words O

Cuff S-PERSON
, O
coming O
up O
full O
of O
pluck O

quite O
reeling O

groggy O
, O
the O
Fig-merchant O
put O
in O
his O
left O
as O
usual O
on O
his O
adversary’s O
nose O

sent O
him O
down O
for O
the O
last O
time O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
that O
will O
do O
for O
him O

opponent O
dropped O
as O
neatly O
on O
the O
green O

ball O
plump O

not O
able O

did O
not O
choose O

stand O
up O
again O

And O
now O
all O
the O
boys O
set O
up O
such O
a O
shout O
for O
Figs O
as O
would O
have O
made O
you O
think O
he O
had O
been O
their O
darling O
champion O
through O
the O
whole O
battle O

and O
as O
absolutely O
brought O
Dr. O

out O
of O
his O
study O

curious O
to O
know O
the O
cause O

uproar O

flog O

In O

came O
back O

Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
modest O
a O
young O
fellow O
to O
suppose O
that O
this O
happy O
change O
in O
all O
his O
circumstances O
arose O
from O
his O
own O
generous O

manly O
disposition O
: O
he O
chose O
, O
from O
some O
perverseness O

to O
attribute O
his O
good O
fortune O
to O
the O

benevolence O
of O
little O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON

to O
whom O
henceforth O
he O
vowed O
such O
a O
love O

affection O
as O
is O
only O
felt O
by O
children O
— O
such O
an O
affection O
, O
as O
we O
read O
in O

, O
uncouth O
Orson S-PERSON
had O
for O
splendid O

He O
flung O
himself O
down O
at O

loved O
him O

Even O
before O

he O
had O
admired O
Osborne S-PERSON

Now O
he O
was O
his O
valet O

his O

his O
man O
Friday S-DATE

He O
believed O

the O

to O
be O
the O

He O
shared O
his O

the O
clumsiest O

no O

of O

from O
yellow O
fever O

, O
to O
which O
the O
fortune O
of O

ordered O

so O
many O
of O
his O
gallant O
comrades O
were O
reaping O
glory O
in O
the O
Peninsula S-LOC

He O
had O
arrived O
with O
a O
knock O
so O
very O
timid O

quiet O
, O
that O
it O
was O
inaudible O

the O

otherwise O
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
Miss O

would O
never O
have O
been O
so O
bold O
as O

come O
singing O
into O
the O
room O

it O
was O
, O
the O
sweet O
fresh O
little O
voice O
went O
right O
into O
the O
Captain’s O
heart O
, O
and O
nestled O
there O
. O
When O
she O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
for O
him O
to O
shake O
, O
before O
he O
enveloped O
it O
in O
his O
own O
, O
he O
paused O
, O
and O
thought O
— O
“ O
Well O

it O
possible O

you O
the O
little O
maid O

a O
short O
time O
ago O

the O
night O
I O
upset O
the O

just O
after O

was O
gazetted O

you O
the O
little O

George B-PERSON

you O
seem O

what O
a O
prize O
the O
rogue O
has O
got O
! O
” O
All O
this O

thought O

before O

took O
Amelia’s S-PERSON

KNOW O
that O
the O
tune O

a O
very O
mild O
one O
( O
although O
there O
are O
some O
terrific O

, O
and O
must O
beg O
the O
good O

natured O

to O
remember O

that O

has O
asked O

to O
Vauxhall S-ORG

Jos B-PERSON

in O
love O

Will O
he O
marry O
her O
? O
That O
is O
the O
great O
subject O
now O
in O
hand O
. O
We O
might O
have O
treated O
this O
subject O
in O
the O
genteel O
, O
or O
in O
the O
romantic O
, O
or O
in O
the O
facetious O
manner O
. O
Suppose O
we O
had O
laid O
the O
scene O
in O
Grosvenor B-FAC
Square E-FAC

with O
the O
very O
same O
adventures O

would O
not O
some O
people O
have O
listened O
? O

we O
had O
shown O
how O
Lord O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
fell O
in O
love O
, O
and O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
of O

became O
attached O

Lady B-PERSON

with O
the O
full O
consent O
of O
the O
Duke S-PERSON

her O
noble O
father O
: O
or O
instead O
of O
the O
supremely O
genteel O
, O
suppose O
we O
had O
resorted O
to O
the O
entirely O
low O
, O

described O
what O
was O
going O
on O
in O

how O

love O
with O
the O
cook O

as O
indeed O
he O
was O

how O
he O
fought O
a O
battle O
with O
the O
coachman O
in O
her O
behalf O

how O

refused O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
without O
a O
wax O
candle O

such O
incidents O
might O
be O
made O
to O
provoke O
much O
delightful O
laughter O
, O
and O
be O
supposed O
to O
represent O
scenes O
of O
“ O
life O

” O
Or O
if O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
we O
had O
taken O
a O
fancy O
for O
the O
terrible O

lover O

professional O
burglar O

not O
to O
be O
let O
loose O
again O
till O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
volume O
, O
we O
should O
easily O
have O
constructed O
a O
tale O
of O
thrilling O
interest O
, O
through O
the O
fiery O
chapters O
of O
which O
the O
reader O
should O
hurry O
, O
panting O
. O
But O
my O
readers O
must O
hope O
for O
no O
such O
romance O
, O
only O
a O
homely O
story O
, O
and O
must O
be O
content O
with O
a O
chapter O
about O
Vauxhall S-ORG
, O
which O
is O
so O
short O
that O
it O
scarce O
deserves O
to O
be O
called O
a O
chapter O
at O
all O
. O
And O
yet O
it O
is O
a O
chapter O
, O
and O
a O
very O
important O
one O
too O
. O
Are O
not O
there O
little O
chapters O
in O
everybody’s O
life O

that O
seem O
to O
be O
nothing O

yet O
affect O
all O

rest O
of O

us O

propose O

make O
Rebecca B-PERSON

parents O
at O

acquiesced O

the O
arrangement O

, O
between O
ourselves O
, O
old O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
had O
a O
feeling O
very O
much O
akin O

contempt O
for O
his O
son O

He O
said O
he O
was O
vain O
, O
selfish O

lazy O

and O
effeminate O

He O
could O
not O
endure O
his O
airs O
as O
a O
man O
of O
fashion O
, O
and O
laughed O
heartily O
at O
his O
pompous O
braggadocio O
stories O
. O
“ O
I O
shall O
leave O
the O
fellow O
half S-CARDINAL

Amelia S-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
as O
became O
a O
young O
woman O
of O
her O
prudence O

temperament O
, O
was O
quite O
enthusiastic O
for O
the O
match O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
been O
on O
the O
point O
of O
saying O
something O
very O
important O
to O
her O
, O
to O
which O
she O
was O
most O
willing O
to O
lend O
an O
ear O
, O

the O
fat O
fellow O
could O
not O

himself O

his O
great O
secret O

very O
much O
to O
his O
sister’s O
disappointment O

only O
rid O
himself O
of O
a O
large O
sigh O

turned O
away O

mystery O

to O
keep O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
gentle O
bosom O
in O
a O
perpetual O
flutter O
of O
excitement O

she O
did O
not O
speak O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
on O
the O
tender O
subject O
, O
she O
compensated O
herself O
with O
long O

intimate O
conversations O
with O
Mrs. O
Blenkinsop S-PERSON

Ma’am O
, O
” O
ejaculated O
Mrs. O
Blenkinsop S-PERSON
, O
“ O
we O
was O
only O
grocers O
when O
we O
married O
Mr. O
S. S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
a O
stock O
- O
broker’s O
clerk O
, O
and O
we O
hadn’t O
five B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
among O
us O
, O
and O
we’re O
rich O
enough O
now O
. O
” O
And O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
entirely O
of O
this O
opinion O
, O
to O
which O
, O
gradually O
, O
the O
good O
- O
natured O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
brought O
. O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
neutral O
. O
“ O
Let O
Jos S-PERSON
marry O
whom O
he O
likes O
, O
” O
he O
said O
| | O
“ O
it’s O
no O
affair O
of O
mine O
. O
This O
girl O
has O
no O
fortune O

no O
more O
had O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
. O
She O
seems O
good O
- O
humoured O
and O
clever O
, O
and O
will O
keep O
him O
in O
order O
, O
perhaps O
. O
Better O
she O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
than O
a O
black O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
of O
mahogany O
grandchildren O
. O
” O
So O
that O
everything O
seemed O
to O
smile O
upon O
Rebecca’s S-ORG
fortunes O
. O
She O
took O
Jos’s S-PERSON
arm O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
on O
going O
to O
dinner O
| | O
she O
had O
sate O
by O
him O
on O
the O
box O
of O
his O
open O
carriage O
( O
a O
most O
tremendous O
“ O
buck O
” O
he O
was O
, O
as O
he O
sat O
there O
, O
serene O
, O
in O
state O
, O
driving O
his O
greys O
) O
, O
and O
though O
nobody O
said O
a O
word O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
marriage O
, O
everybody O
seemed O
to O
understand O
it O
. O
All O
she O
wanted O
was O
the O
proposal O
, O
and O
ah O
! O
how O
Rebecca S-PERSON
now O
felt O
the O
want O
of O
a O
mother O
! O
— O
a O
dear O
, O
tender O
mother O
, O
who O
would O
have O
managed O
the O
business O
in O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
little O
delicate O
confidential O
conversation O
, O
would O
have O
extracted O
the O
interesting O
avowal O
from O
the O
bashful O
lips O
of O
the O
young O
man O
! O
Such O
was O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
as O
the O
carriage O
crossed O
Westminster B-FAC
- I-FAC
bridge E-FAC
. O
The O
party O
was O
landed O
at O
the B-FAC
Royal I-FAC
Gardens E-FAC
in O
due O
time O
. O
As O
the O
majestic O
Jos S-PERSON
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
creaking O
vehicle O
the O
crowd O
gave O
a O
cheer O
for O
the O
fat O
gentleman O
, O
who O
blushed O
and O
looked O
very O
big O
and O
mighty O
, O
as O
he O
walked O
away O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
under O
his O
arm O
. O
George S-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
took O
charge O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
She O
looked O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
rosetree O
in O
sunshine O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
” O
says O
George S-PERSON
, O
“ O
just O
look O
to O
the O
shawls O
and O
things O
, O
there’s O
a O
good O
fellow O
. O
” O
And O
so O
while O
he O
paired O
off O
with O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
squeezed O
through O
the O
gate O
into O
the O
gardens O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
at O
his O
side O
, O
honest O
Dobbin S-PERSON
contented O
himself O
by O
giving O
an O
arm O
to O
the O
shawls O
, O
and O
by O
paying O
at O
the O
door O
for O
the O
whole O
party O
. O
He O
walked O
very O
modestly O
behind O
them O
. O
He O
was O
not O
willing O
to O
spoil O
sport O
. O
About O
Rebecca S-PERSON
and O
Jos S-PERSON
he O
did O
not O
care O
a O
fig O
. O
But O
he O
thought O
Amelia S-PERSON
worthy O
even O
of O
the O
brilliant O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
, O
and O
as O
he O
saw O
that O
good O
- O
looking O
couple O
threading O
the O
walks O
to O
the O
girl’s O
delight O
and O
wonder O
, O
he O
watched O
her O
artless O
happiness O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
fatherly O
pleasure O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
something O
on O
his O
own O
arm O
besides O
a O
shawl O
( O
the O
people O
laughed O
at O
seeing O
the O
gawky O
young O
officer O
carrying O
this O
female O
burthen O
) O
: O
but O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
was O
very O
little O
addicted O
to O
selfish O
calculation O
at O
all O
| | O
and O
so O
long O
as O
his O
friend O
was O
enjoying O
himself O
, O
how O
should O
he O
be O
discontented O
? O
And O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
of O
all O
the O
delights O
of O
the O
Gardens O
| | O
of O
the B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
extra O
lamps O
, O
which O
were O
always O
lighted O

the O
fiddlers O
in O
cocked O
hats O
, O
who O
played O
ravishing O
melodies O
under O
the O
gilded O
cockle O

shell O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
gardens O

the O
singers O
, O
both O
of O
comic O
and O
sentimental O
ballads O
, O
who O
charmed O
the O
ears O
there O

the O
country O
dances O
, O
formed O
by O
bouncing O
cockneys O
and O
cockneyesses O
, O
and O
executed O
amidst O
jumping O
, O
thumping O
, O
and O
laughter O

the O
signal O
which O
announced O
that O
Madame B-PERSON

was O
about O
to O
mount O
skyward O
on O
a O
slack O

ascending O
to O
the O
stars O

always O
sat O
in O
the O
illuminated O
hermitage O

dark O
walks O
, O
so O
favourable O
to O
the O
interviews O
of O
young O
lovers O

stout O
handed O
about O
by O
the O
people O
in O
the O
shabby O
old O
liveries O

and O
the O
twinkling O
boxes O

in O
which O
the O
happy O
feasters O
made O

believe O
to O
eat O
slices O
of O
almost O
invisible O
ham O

— O
of O
all O
these O
things O

and O
of O
the O
gentle O
Simpson S-PERSON
, O
that O
kind O
smiling O
idiot O
, O
who O
, O
I O
daresay O
, O
presided O
even O
then O
over O
the O
place O
— O
Captain O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
did O
not O
take O
the O
slightest O
notice O
. O
He O
carried O
about O
Amelia’s O
white O
cashmere O
shawl O
, O
and O
having O
attended O
under O
the O
gilt O
cockle O

while O
Mrs. O

performed O
the B-WORK_OF_ART

lately O
met O
with O
his O
Russian S-NORP
reverses O

— O
Mr. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
tried O
to O
hum O
it O
as O
he O
walked O
away O
, O
and O
found O
he O
was O
humming O
— O
the O
tune O
which O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
sang O
on O
the O
stairs O
, O
as O
she O
came O
down O
to O
dinner O
. O
He O
burst O
out O
laughing O
at O
himself O
| | O
for O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
he O
could O
sing O
no O
better O
than O
an O
owl O
. O
It O
is O
to O
be O
understood O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
that O
our O
young O
people O
, O
being O
in O
parties O
of O
two S-CARDINAL
and O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
made O
the O
most O
solemn O
promises O
to O
keep O
together O
during O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
separated O
in O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
afterwards O
. O
Parties O
at O
Vauxhall S-ORG
always O
did O
separate O
, O
but O
’ O
twas O
only O
to O
meet O
again O
at O
supper O
- O
time O
, O
when O
they O
could O
talk O
of O
their O
mutual O
adventures O
in O
the O
interval O
. O
What O
were O
the O
adventures O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
That O
is O
a O
secret O
. O
But O
be O
sure O
of O
this O
— O
they O
were O
perfectly O
happy O
, O
and O
correct O
in O
their O
behaviour O
| | O
and O
as O
they O
had O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
being O
together O
any O
time O
these B-DATE
fifteen I-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
their O
tête O
- O
à O
- O
tête O
offered O
no O
particular O
novelty O
. O
But O
when O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp E-PERSON
and O
her O
stout O
companion O
lost O
themselves O
in O
a O
solitary O
walk O
, O
in O
which O
there O
were O
not O
above O
five S-CARDINAL
score O
more O
of O
couples O
similarly O
straying O
, O
they O
both O
felt O
that O
the O
situation O
was O
extremely O
tender O
and O
critical O
, O
and O
now O
or O
never O
was O
the O
moment O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
thought O
, O
to O
provoke O
that O
declaration O
which O
was O
trembling O
on O
the O
timid O
lips O
of O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
. O
They O
had O
previously O
been O
to O
the O
panorama O
of O
Moscow S-GPE
, O
where O
a O
rude O
fellow O
, O
treading O
on O
Miss O
Saharp’s S-PERSON
foot O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
fall O
back O
with O
a O
little O
shriek O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
little O
incident O
increased O
the O
tenderness O
and O
confidence O
of O
that O
gentleman O
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
he O
told O
her O
several O
of O
his O
favourite O
Indian S-NORP
stories O
over O
again O
for O
, O
at O
least O
, O
the O
sixth S-ORDINAL
time O
. O
“ O
How O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
India S-GPE
! O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Should O
you O
? O
” O
said O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
most O
killing O
tenderness O
| | O
and O
was O
no O
doubt O
about O
to O
follow O
up O
this O
artful O
interrogatory O
by O
a O
question O
still O
more O
tender O
( O
for O
he O
puffed O
and O
panted O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
Rebecca’s O
hand O
, O
which O
was O
placed O
near O
his O
heart O
, O
could O
count O
the O
feverish O
pulsations O
of O
that O
organ O
) O
, O
when O
, O
oh O
, O
provoking O
! O
the O
bell O
rang O
for O
the O
fireworks O
, O
and O
, O
a O
great O
scuffling O
and O
running O
taking O
place O
, O
these O
interesting O
lovers O
were O
obliged O
to O
follow O
in O
the O
stream O
of O
people O
. O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
some O
thoughts O
of O
joining O
the O
party O
at O
supper O
: O
as O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
he O
found O
the O
Vauxhall S-ORG
amusements O
not O
particularly O
lively O
— O
but O
he O
paraded O
twice O
before O
the O
box O
where O
the O
now O
united O
couples O
were O
met O
, O
and O
nobody O
took O
any O
notice O
of O
him O
. O
Covers O
were O
laid O
for O
four S-CARDINAL
. O
The O
mated O
pairs O
were O
prattling O
away O
quite O
happily O
, O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
knew O
he O
was O
as O
clean O
forgotten O
as O
if O
he O
had O
never O
existed O
in O
this O
world O
. O
“ O
I O
should O
only O
be O
de O
trop O
, O
” O
said O
the O
Captain O
, O
looking O
at O
them O
rather O
wistfully O
. O
“ O
I’d O
best O
go O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
hermit O
, O
” O
— O
and O
so O
he O
strolled O
off O
out O
of O
the O
hum O
of O
men O
, O
and O
noise O
and O
clatter O
of O
the O
banquet O
, O
into O
the O
dark O
walk O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
lived O
that O
well O
- O
known O
pasteboard O
Solitary O
. O
It O
wasn’t O
very O
good O
fun O
for O
Dobbin S-PERSON
— O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
be O
alone O
at O
Vauxhall S-ORG
, O
I O
have O
found O
, O
from O
my O
own O
experience O
, O
to O
be O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
dismal O
sports O
ever O
entered O
into O
by O
a O
bachelor O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
couples O
were O
perfectly O
happy O
then O
in O
their O
box O
: O
where O
the O
most O
delightful O
and O
intimate O
conversation O
took O
place O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
in O
his O
glory O
, O
ordering O
about O
the O
waiters O
with O
great O
majesty O
. O
He O
made O
the O
salad O
| | O
and O
uncorked O
the O
Champagne S-PRODUCT
| | O
and O
carved O
the O
chickens O
| | O
and O
ate O
and O
drank O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
refreshments O
on O
the O
tables O
. O
Finally O
, O
he O
insisted O
upon O
having O
a O
bowl O
of O
rack O
punch O
| | O
everybody O
had O
rack O
punch O
at O
Vauxhall S-ORG
. O
“ O
Waiter O
, O
rack O
punch O
. O
” O
That O
bowl O
of O
rack O
punch O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
this O

a O
liveliness O

at O
first S-ORDINAL
was O
astonishing O
, O

then O
became O
almost O
painful O

he O
talked O

laughed O
so O
loud O

, O

gracefully O
to O

come O
in O

take O
a O
share O

his O
punch O

Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
just O
on O
the O
point O
of O
knocking O
down O
a O
gentleman O
in O
top O
- O
boots O
, O
who O
proposed O
to O
take O
advantage O

this O
invitation O
, O
and O
a O
commotion O
seemed O
to O
be O
inevitable O
, O
when O
by O
the O
greatest O
good O
luck O
a O
gentleman O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
walking O
about O
the O
gardens O
, O
stepped O
up O
to O
the O
box O
. O
“ O
Be O
off O
, O
you O
fools O
! O
” O
said O
this O
gentleman O
— O
shouldering O
off O
a O
great O
number O
of O
the O
crowd O
, O
who O
vanished O
presently O
before O
his O
cocked O
hat O
and O
fierce O
appearance O
— O
and O
he O
entered O
the O
box O
in O
a O
most O
agitated O
state O
. O
“ O
Good O
Heavens O
! O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
where O
have O
you O
been O
? O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
, O
seizing O
the O
white O
cashmere O
shawl O
from O
his O
friend’s O
arm O
, O
and O
huddling O
up O
Amelia S-PERSON
in O
it O
. O
— O
“ O
Make O
yourself O
useful O
, O
take O
charge O
of O
Jos S-PERSON
here O
, O
whilst O
I O
take O
the O
ladies O
to O
the O
carriage O

” O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
for O
rising O
to O
interfere O
— O
but O
a O
single O
push O
from O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
finger O
sent O
him O
puffing O
back O
into O
his O
seat O
again O
, O

the O
lieutenant O
was O
enabled O
to O
remove O
the O
ladies O
in O
safety O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
kissed O
his O
hand O
to O
them O
as O
they O
retreated O
, O
and O
hiccupped O
out O
“ O
Bless O
you O
! O
Bless O
you O
! O
” O
Then O
, O
seizing O
Captain O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
hand O
, O
and O
weeping O
in O
the O
most O
pitiful O
way O
, O
he O
confided O
to O
that O
gentleman O
the O
secret O
of O
his O
loves O
. O
He O
adored O
that O
girl O
who O
had O
just O
gone O
out O

he O
had O
broken O
her O
heart O
, O
he O
knew O
he O
had O
, O
by O
his O
conduct O

he O
would O
marry O
her O
next B-TIME
morning E-TIME
at O
St. B-FAC
George’s I-FAC
, I-FAC
Hanover I-FAC
Square E-FAC
| | O
he’d O
knock O
up O
the B-PERSON
Archbishop I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Canterbury E-PERSON
at O
Lambeth S-GPE
: O
he O
would O
, O
by O
Jove S-PERSON
! O
and O
have O
him O
in O
readiness O
| | O
and O
, O
acting O
on O
this O
hint O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
shrewdly O
induced O
him O
to O
leave O
the O
gardens O
and O
hasten O
to O
Lambeth B-FAC
Palace E-FAC
, O
and O
, O
when O
once O
out O
of O
the O
gates O
, O
easily O
conveyed O
Mr. O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
into O
a O
hackney O
- O
coach O
, O
which O
deposited O
him O
safely O
at O
his O
lodgings O
. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
conducted O
the O
girls O
home O
in O
safety O
: O
and O
when O
the O
door O
was O
closed O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
as O
he O
walked O
across O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
laughed O
so O
as O
to O
astonish O
the O
watchman O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
looked O
very O
ruefully O
at O
her O
friend O
, O
as O
they O
went O
up O
stairs O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
without O
any O
more O
talking O
. O
“ O
He O
must O
propose O
to O
- O
morrow O
, O
” O
thought O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
He O
called O
me O
his O
soul’s O
darling O

four S-CARDINAL
times O

must O

And O
so O
thought O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
too O
. O
And O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
dress O
she O
was O
to O
wear O
as O
bridesmaid O
, O
and O
of O
the O
presents O

nice O
little O

Through O

can O
remember O

consequence O

two S-CARDINAL

glasses O

a O
quart O

abominable O

That O
next O
morning O
, O
which O
Rebecca S-PERSON
thought O
was O
to O
dawn O
upon O
her O
fortune O

found O
Sedley S-PERSON
groaning O
in O
agonies O
which O
the O
pen O
refuses O
to O
describe O
. O
Soda O

Small O
beer O

only O

the O
ex-collector O

on O
the O
sofa O
at O

Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
already O
in O
the O

good O

patient O
of O
the O
night O

The O
two S-CARDINAL

at O
the O
prostrate O
Bacchanalian S-PERSON

askance O
at O
each O

exchanged O
the O
most O
frightful O
sympathetic O
grins O

Sedley’s S-PERSON
valet O

the O
most O
solemn O

correct O
of O
gentlemen O

with O
the O
muteness O

gravity O
of O
an O
undertaker O

could O
hardly O
keep O
his O
countenance O

order O

he O
looked O
at O

unfortunate O
master O

“ O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
uncommon O
wild O
last O
night O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
he O
whispered O
in O
confidence O
to O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
as O
the O
latter O
mounted O
the O
stair O

“ O

wanted O

’ackney O

The O
Capting S-PERSON
was O
obliged O
to O
bring O
him O
up O
stairs O
in O
his O
harms O
like O
a O
babby O

” O
A O
momentary O
smile O
flickered O
over O
Mr. O
Brush’s S-PERSON
features O
as O
he O
spoke O

instantly O
, O
however O
, O
they O
relapsed O
into O
their O
usual O
unfathomable O
calm O
, O
as O
he O
flung O
open O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
, O
and O
announced O
“ O
Mr. O
Hosbin S-PERSON

” O
“ O
How O
are O
you O
, O
Sedley S-PERSON

” O
that O
young O
wag O
began O
, O
after O
surveying O
his O
victim O
. O
“ O
No O
bones O
broke O

There’s O
a O
hackney O

a O
black O
eye O

up O

“ O
What O
do O
you O
mean O

— O
law O

” O
Sedley S-PERSON
faintly O
asked O

“ O

thrashing O
him O
last B-TIME
night E-TIME

didn’t O
he O
, O

You O
hit O
out O

did O
have O
a O
round O
with O
the O
coachman O

Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
, O
“ O

showed O
plenty O

“ O

white O

roused O

ejaculated O
Jos S-PERSON
from O
the O
sofa O
, O

made O
a O
grimace O
so O
dreary O

ludicrous O

that O
the O
Captain’s O
politeness O
could O
restrain O
him O
no O
longer O

he O

Osborne S-PERSON
fired O
off O

ringing O
volley O

pursued O

from O

“ O

laughing O

enjoying O
the O

most O
ludicrous O

the O
dismal O
condition O

unhappy O

George S-PERSON
only O
laughed O
the O
more O
at O
her O
piteous O

discomfited O
mien O

persisted O
in O
thinking O
the O
joke O
a O
most O
diverting O
one O
, O

when O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
came O
down O

bantered O
her O
with O
a O
great O
deal O

out O

apothecary O

quite O
forgot O
him O

still O
on O
the O
laugh O

he O
overset O
the O
glass O
of O

at O
dinner O

Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON

, O
with O
a O
haughty O
air O

a O
toss O
of O
the O
head O
, O
“ O

I’ll S-PERSON
tell O
him O

Osborne S-PERSON
said O

and O
as O
he O
spoke O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
began O
to O
have O
a O
feeling O
of O
distrust O

hatred O
towards O
this O
young O
officer O
, O
which O
he O
was O
quite O
unconscious O

is O

make O
fun O
of O

“ O

been O
laughing O
about O

— O
A O
film O
passed O
over O
her O
eyes O

her O
heart O
beat O
quite O
quick O
. O
“ O
You’re O
always O
joking O

smiling O
as O
innocently O

she O
could O

“ O

And O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
walked O
away O
— O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
looked O
reprovingly O
at O
him O

felt O
some O
little O
manly O
compunction O
for O

inflicted O
any O

unkindness O
upon O
this O
helpless O
creature O

“ O
My O

He O
was O
off O

again O

he O
did O
it O
so O
drolly O

laughed O
too O

She O
vowed O
eternal O
gratitude O

did O
not O
intrude O
herself O
upon O
that O
good O

too O
much O

who O
was O
embarrassed O

She O
kissed O

her O
kind O

kind O

protector O

Her O
behaviour O
was O
so O
affecting O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
write O
her O
a O
cheque O
for O
twenty B-QUANTITY

he O
restrained O
his O

the O

was O
in O
waiting O

take O
him O

laugh O

for O
he O
was O
no O

respectful O

Mr. O

The O

The O
lady O
addressed O

Mrs. O
Tinker S-PERSON
, O
at O
this O
moment O
made O
her O
appearance O
with O
a O

a O

for O

Sir O

who O
had O
taken O
his O

“ O

“ O

Mrs. O

flinging O
down O
the O

“ O

“ O
And O
like O
me O
none O
the O

Miss O

said O
the O
old O
gentleman O
, O
with O
an O
air O
almost O
of O
politeness O

“ O
I O

Tinker S-PERSON

Presently O
the O
baronet O
plunged O
a O
fork O
into O
the O
saucepan O
on O
the O
fire O
and O
withdrew O
from O
the O
pot O
a O
piece O
of O

an O
onion O

which O
he O
divided O
into O
pretty O
equal O
portions O

of O
which O
he O
partook O
with O
Mrs. O

“ O

Sir O

when O

lighted O
the O

producing O
from O
an O
interminable O

a O

Sir O

the O
solemn O
Tinker S-PERSON

up O

Lady B-PERSON

slept O
her O
last O

The O
bed O

chamber O
were O
so O
funereal O

gloomy O
, O
you O
might O
have O
fancied O
, O
not O
only O
that O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
died O
in O
the O

that O
her O
ghost O
inhabited O
it O

Rebecca S-PERSON
sprang O
about O
the O
apartment O

with O
the O
greatest O
liveliness O

peeped O

examined O
the O
dreary O

while O
the O

little O
cross-questioner O

her O

place O

not O
conversation O

up O

her O
corner O

a O
snore O
as O
only O
the O
nose O

innocence O

produce O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
lay O
awake O
for O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O

thinking O
of O
the O
morrow O

of O
the O
new O
world O
into O
which O
she O
was O
going O

of O
her O
chances O

there O

The O
rushlight O
flickered O
in O
the O
basin O

The O
mantel O
- O
piece O
cast O
up O
a O
great O
black O
shadow O

over O
half O
of O
a O
mouldy O
old O
sampler O
, O
which O
her O
defunct O

had O
worked O

no O

over O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
family O
pictures O

young O

one O
in O
a O
college O

the O
other O
in O
a O
red O
jacket O
like O
a O
soldier O
. O
When O
she O
went O
to O
sleep O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
chose O
that O
one O
to O
dream O
about O

At O
four B-TIME
o’clock E-TIME
, O
on O
such O
a O
roseate O
summer’s O
morning O
as O
even O
made O
Great B-FAC
Gaunt I-FAC

look O
cheerful O

the O
faithful O

her O
prepare O

unbarred O

unbolted O
the O
great O
hall O

the O
clanging O

clapping O

startled O
the O
sleeping O
echoes O
in O
the O
street O
) O
, O
and O
taking O
her O
way O
into O
Oxford B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
summoned O
a O
coach O
from O
a O
stand O
there O
. O
It O
is O
needless O
to O
particularize O
the O
number O
of O
the O
vehicle O
, O
or O
to O
state O
that O
the O
driver O
was O
stationed O
thus O
early O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
Swallow B-FAC

in O
hopes O
that O
some O
young O
buck O
, O
reeling O
homeward O
from O
the O
tavern O

might O
need O
the O
aid O

his O
vehicle O

and O
pay O
him O
with O
the O
generosity O
of O
intoxication O

It O
is O
likewise O
needless O
to O
say O
, O
that O
the O
driver O
, O
if O
he O
had O
any O
such O
hopes O
as O
those O
above O
stated O
, O
was O
grossly O
disappointed O

and O
that O
the O
worthy O
Baronet S-PERSON
whom O
he O
drove O
to O
the O
City O
did O
not O
give O
him O
one B-MONEY
single I-MONEY
penny E-MONEY
more O
than O
his O
fare O

It O
was O
in O
vain O
that O
Jehu S-PERSON
appealed O

stormed O

that O
he O
flung O
down O
Miss O
Sharp’s S-PERSON
bandboxes O
in O
the O
gutter O
at O
the O
‘ O
Necks O

swore O

would O
take O
the O
law O
of O
his O
fare O
. O
“ O
You’d O
better O
not O

“ O

Joe S-PERSON

cried O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON

approvingly O

“ O

I’d O
like O
to O
see O

do O
me O

“ O
So O

grinning O
sulkily O

mounting O
the O
Baronet’s O
baggage O
on O
the O

“ O

exclaims O
the O
Member O

a O
touch O

the O

sulkily O
put O
his O
five S-CARDINAL

both O

But O
my O
kind O

will O
please O
to O
remember O
that O
this O
history O
has O
“ O

Fair E-WORK_OF_ART
” O
for O
a O
title O
, O
and O
that O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
is O
a O
very O
vain O
, O
wicked O
, O
foolish O
place O
, O
full O
of O
all O
sorts O
of O
humbugs O

falseness O

pretensions O

And O
while O
the O
moralist O
, O
who O
is O
holding O
forth O
on O
the O
cover O
( O
an O
accurate O
portrait O

very O
same O
long O

yet O
, O
look O
you O
, O
one O
is O
bound O
to O
speak O
the O
truth O
as O
far O
as O
one O
knows O
it O
, O
whether O
one O
mounts O
a O

or O
a O
shovel O
- O
hat O

and O
a O
deal O
of O
disagreeable O
matter O
must O
come O
out O
in O
the O
course O
of O
such O
an O
undertaking O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
a O
brother O
of O
the O
story O
- O
telling O
trade O
, O
at O
Naples S-GPE
, O
preaching O
to O
a O
pack O
of O
good O
- O
for O
- O
nothing O
honest O
lazy O
fellows O
by O
the O
sea O
- O
shore O
, O
work O
himself O
up O
into O
such O
a O
rage O
and O
passion O
with O
some O
of O
the O
villains O
whose O
wicked O
deeds O
he O
was O
describing O
and O
inventing O
, O
that O
the O
audience O
could O
not O
resist O
it O
| | O
and O
they O
and O
the O
poet O
together O
would O
burst O
out O
into O
a O
roar O
of O
oaths O
and O
execrations O
against O
the O
fictitious O
monster O
of O
the O
tale O
, O
so O
that O
the O
hat O
went O
round O
, O
and O
the O
bajocchi O
tumbled O
into O
it O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
perfect O
storm O
of O
sympathy O
. O
At O
the O
little O
Paris S-GPE
theatres O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
you O
will O
not O
only O
hear O
the O
people O
yelling O
out O
: O
“ O
Ah O
gredin O
! O
Ah O
monstre O
! O
” O
and O
cursing O
the O
tyrant O
of O
the O
play O
from O
the O
boxes O

but O
the O
actors O
themselves O
positively O
refuse O
to O
play O
the O
wicked O
parts O
, O
such O
as O
those O
of O
infâmes O
Anglais S-PERSON
, O
brutal O
Cossacks S-NORP
, O
and O
what O
not O
, O
and O
prefer O
to O
appear O
at O
a O
smaller O
salary O
, O
in O
their O
real O
characters O
as O
loyal O
Frenchmen S-NORP
. O
I O
set O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
stories O
one O
against O
the O
other O
, O
so O
that O
you O
may O
see O
that O
it O
is O
not O
from O
mere O
mercenary O
motives O
that O
the O
present O
performer O
is O
desirous O
to O
show O
up O
and O
trounce O
his O
villains O
| | O
but O
because O
he O
has O
a O
sincere O
hatred O
of O
them O
, O
which O
he O
cannot O
not O
keep O
down O
, O
and O
which O
must O
find O
a O
vent O
in O
suitable O
abuse O
and O
bad O
language O
. O
I O
warn O
my O
“ O
kyind O
friends O
, O
” O
then O
, O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
tell O
a O
story O
of O
harrowing O
villany O
and O
complicated O
— O
but O
, O
as O
I O
trust O
, O
intensely O
interesting O
— O
crime O
. O
My O
rascals O
are O
not O
milk O
- O
and O
- O
water O
rascals O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
. O
When O
we O
come O
to O
the O
proper O
places O
we O
won’t O
spare O
fine O
language O
— O
No O
. O
no O
! O
But O
when O
we O
are O
going O
over O
the O
quiet O
country O
we O
must O
perforce O
be O
calm O
. O
A O
tempest O
in O
a O
slop O
- O
basin O
is O
absurd O
We O
will O
reserve O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
for O
the O
mighty O
ocean O
and O
the O
lonely O
midnight O
. O
The O
present O
Chapter O
is O
very O
mild O

Others O

But O
we O
will O
not O
anticipate O
those O
. O
And O
, O
as O
we O
bring O
our O
characters O
forward O

I O
will O
ask O

as O
a O
man O

a O
brother O

not O
only O

occasionally O

step O
down O

talk O
about O
them O

if O

love O

shake O
them O

in O
the O

to O
abuse O
them O
in O
the O
strongest O
terms O
which O
politeness O
admits O
of O

Otherwise O
you O
might O
fancy O

sneering O

the O
practice O

which O
Miss O

so O
ridiculous O

humouredly O
at O
the O
reeling O
old O

His O
first S-ORDINAL

had O
been O
made O
under O

his O
parents O

as O
he O
often O
told O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
in O
her O
life O
- O
time O
she O
was O
such O
a O
confounded O

What O
a O
happy O
woman O
was O
Rose S-PERSON
to O
be O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
! O
Let O
us O
set O
down O
the O
items O
of O
her O
happiness O
. O
In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
, O
she O
gave O
up O
Peter B-PERSON
Butt E-PERSON
, O
a O
young O
man O
who O
kept O
company O
with O
her O
, O
and O
in O
consequence O
of O
his O
disappointment O
in O
love O

took O
to O
smuggling O

poaching O
, O
and O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
other O
bad O
courses O

Then O
she O
quarrelled O

duty O
bound O

with O
all O
the O
friends O

her O

nor O
did O
she O
find O
in O
her O

abode O
many O
persons O
who O
were O
willing O

Who O

did O
? O
Sir O
Huddleston B-PERSON
Fuddleston E-PERSON
had O
three S-CARDINAL
daughters O

all O
hoped O
to O
be O
Lady B-PERSON

Sir O
Giles B-PERSON
Wapshot’s E-PERSON

were O
insulted O
that O
one S-CARDINAL

the O

the O
remaining O
baronets O

misalliance O

Never O
mind O
the O
commoners O
, O
whom O
we O
will O
leave O
to O
grumble O
anonymously O

Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
did O
not O
care O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
a O
brass O
farden O
for O
any O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O

He O
had O
his O

what O
more O
need O

So O
he O
used O

get O
drunk O
every O
night O

beat O
his O
pretty O
Rose S-PERSON

As O
the O
only O

foolish O

her O
hold O

Sir O

not O

Her O
roses O
faded O
out O

her O

the O

left O

after O
the O
birth O

a O

Mr. O

noble O
Binkies S-PERSON

from O

came O
back O
from O
Christchurch S-GPE

of O
his O

stood O
in O

of O
him O

He O
was O
a O
man O
of O
such O
rigid O
refinement O

that O
he O
would O
have O
starved O
rather O

He O
seldom O

when O

did O
it O
was O
with O
the O

there O

I O

sorry O

his O
younger O
brother O
Rawdon S-PERSON
used O

lick O
him O
violently O

But O
though O
his O
parts O
were O
not O
brilliant O

he O
made O
up O
for O
his O
lack O
of O
talent O
by O
meritorious O
industry O

and O
was O
never O
known O
, O
during O
eight B-DATE

it O

thought O
none O

a O

At O
college O
his O
career O
was O
of O

highly O
creditable O

And O
here O
he O
prepared O
himself O
for O
public O

he O
was O

But O
though O
he O

a O

delivered O
his O
little O
voice O
with O
great O
pomposity O

pleasure O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
never O
advanced O
any O
sentiment O

opinion O
which O
was O
not O
perfectly O
trite O

stale O

and O
supported O
by O
a O
Latin S-NORP

yet O
he O
failed O
somehow O

a O

ought O

have O
insured O
any O

all O

at O

up O

began O

Sir O

at O

seldom O

with O
four S-CARDINAL

could O

Sir O

might O
have O
become O
very O
wealthy O

been O
an O
attorney O

a O
country O
town O

with O
no O
capital O

his O
brains O

it O

unluckily O

large O

both O

went O
rather O

had O
a O
taste O

law O

cost O
him O
many B-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL

grudged O
him O
the O

more O

speculated O

he O
would O
not O

had O
the O
satisfaction O

finding O

ran O
away O

took O

thus O
read O
together O
many O
delightful O
French S-LANGUAGE

English S-LANGUAGE
works O
, O
among O
which O
may O
be O
mentioned O
those O
of O
the O

Dr. O
Smollett S-PERSON
, O
of O
the O
ingenious O
Mr. O
Henry B-PERSON

Monsieur B-PERSON
Crèbillon E-PERSON
the O
younger O
, O
whom O
our O

so O
much O
admired O

and O
of O
the O
universal O
Monsieur B-PERSON

Voltaire E-PERSON
. O
Once O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
asked O
what O
the O
young O
people O
were O
reading O
, O
the O
governess O
replied O
“ O
Smollett S-PERSON
. O
” O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Smollett S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
quite O
satisfied O
. O
“ O
His O
history O
is O
more O
dull O
, O
but O
by O
no O
means O
so O
dangerous O
as O
that O
of O
Mr. O
Hume S-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
history O
you O
are O
reading O

” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
” O
said O
Miss O
Rose S-PERSON

without O
, O

, O
adding O
that O
it O
was O
the O
history O
of O
Mr. O
Humphrey B-PERSON
Clinker E-PERSON
. O
On O
another O
occasion O
he O
was O
rather O
scandalised O
at O
finding O
his O
sister O
with O
a O
book O
of O
French S-NORP
plays O
| | O
but O
as O
the O
governess O
remarked O
that O
it O
was O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
acquiring O
the O
French S-NORP
idiom O
in O
conversation O
, O
he O
was O
fain O
to O
be O
content O
. O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
diplomatist O
, O
was O
exceedingly O
proud O
of O
his O
own O
skill O
in O
speaking O
the O
French S-NORP
language O
( O
for O
he O
was O
of O
the O
world O
still O
) O
, O
and O
not O
a O
little O
pleased O
with O
the O
compliments O
which O
the O
governess O
continually O
paid O
him O
upon O
his O
proficiency O
. O
Miss O
Violet’s S-PERSON
tastes O
were O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
more O
rude O
and O
boisterous O
than O
those O
of O
her O
sister O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
sequestered O
spots O
where O
the O
hens O
laid O
their O
eggs O

She O
could O
climb O
a O
tree O

rob O
the O
nests O
of O
the O
feathered O
songsters O
of O
their O
speckled O
spoils O
. O
And O
her O
pleasure O
was O
to O
ride O
the O
young O
colts O
, O
and O
to O
scour O
the O
plains O
like O
Camilla S-PERSON

was O
the O
favourite O
of O
her O

of O
the O
stable O

She O
was O
the O
darling O
, O
and O
withal O
the O
terror O
of O
the O
cook O

for O
she O
discovered O
the O
haunt O
of O
the O
jam O

pots O
and O
would O
attack O
them O
when O
they O
were O
within O
her O
reach O
. O
She O
and O
her O
sister O
were O
engaged O
in O
constant O
battles O

Any O
of O
which O
peccadilloes O
, O
if O
Miss O

discovered O
, O
she O
did O
not O
tell O
them O

Lady B-PERSON

who O
would O

the O

worse O
, O
to O
Mr. O

promised O
not O

girl O

With O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
was O
respectful O

obedient O

She O
used O
to O
consult O
him O
on O
passages O
of O
French S-LANGUAGE

she O
could O
not O
understand O

her O
mother O

construe O

giving O
her O
his O
aid O

even O
to O

by O
his O
discourses O

an O
evening O

would O
say O

“ O
Oh O

thank O
you O

with O
a O
sigh O

a O
look O
up O
to O
heaven O
, O
that O
made O
him O
occasionally O
condescend O
to O
shake O
hands O
with O
her O

“ O
Blood O

twice O
about O
the O
propriety O

that O

the O

was O
quite O
ornament O
enough O

if O
I O
was O
born O

indeed O
to O
be O
a O
country O

quite O
cured O

Sir O

Miss O

ill O

why O
not O
the O

So O
the O
children O

came O
with O
Miss O

of O
an O
evening O
some O
of O
the O

walk O

Not O
Miss O

the O
walk O

up O

Queen’s B-GPE

was O
charming O
in O
the O
moonlight O
to O
two S-CARDINAL
such O
lovers O
of O
the O
picturesque O
as O
the O
Captain O
and O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
O O
those O
stars O
, O
those O
stars O
! O
” O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
would O
say O
, O
turning O
her O
twinkling O
green O
eyes O
up O
towards O
them O
. O
“ O
I O
feel O
myself O
almost O
a O
spirit O
when O
I O
gaze O
upon O
them O

” O
“ O
O O
— O
ah O
— O
Gad O
— O
yes O
, O
so O
do O
I O
exactly O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
” O
the O
other O
enthusiast O
replied O
. O
“ O
You O
don’t O
mind O
my O
cigar O
, O
do O
you O
, O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
? O
” O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
loved O
the O
smell O
of O
a O
cigar O
out O
of O
doors O
beyond O
everything O
in O
the O
world O
— O
and O
she O
just O
tasted O
one O
too O
, O
in O
the O
prettiest O
way O
possible O
, O
and O
gave O
a O
little O
puff O
, O
and O
a O
little O
scream O
, O
and O
a O
little O
giggle O
, O
and O
restored O
the O
delicacy O
to O
the O
Captain O
, O
who O
twirled O
his O
moustache O
, O
and O
straightway O
puffed O
it O
into O
a O
blaze O
that O
glowed O
quite O
red O
in O
the O
dark O
plantation O
, O
and O
swore O
— O
“ O
Jove O
— O
aw O

aw O

it’s O
the O
finest O

smoked O

” O
for O
his O
intellect O
and O
conversation O
were O
alike O
brilliant O

becoming O
to O
a O
heavy O
young O
dragoon O

Old O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON

who O
was O
taking O
his O

talking O
to O
John B-PERSON
Horrocks E-PERSON
about O
a O
“ O

was O
to O

the O

so O
occupied O
from O
his O
study O

window O
, O
and O
with O
dreadful O
oaths O
swore O
that O
if O
it O
wasn’t O
for O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
he’d O
take O
Rawdon S-PERSON

bundle O
un O
out O

Mr. O

“ O

more O
valuable O

those O
fugitive O
charms O
which O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years E-DATE
will O
inevitably O
tarnish O

It O
is O
quite O
edifying O
to O
hear O
women O

upon O
the O
worthlessness O

those O

very O

the O
heroic O

a O

the O
latter O

this O
consolation O

that O

for O
my O

repeatedly O
told O
by O

I O

the O

that O
Miss O

yet O
I O
know O
that O
I O

the O
most O

so O
I O
am O
tempted O
to O
think O
that O
to O
be O
despised O
by O
her O
sex O

a O
very O
great O
compliment O
to O
a O
woman O

The O
young O
ladies O
in O
Amelia’s S-NORP
society O
did O
this O
for O
her O
very O
satisfactorily O

For O
instance O
, O
there O
was O
scarcely O
any O
point O
upon O

the O
Misses B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
, O
George’s S-PERSON
sisters O

the B-PERSON
Mesdemoiselles I-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
agreed O
so O
well O
as O
in O
their O
estimate O
of O
her O
very O
trifling O
merits O
: O
and O
their O
wonder O
that O
their O
brothers O
could O
find O
any O
charms O
in O
her O
. O
“ O
We O
are O
kind O
to O
her O
, O
” O
the B-PERSON
Misses I-PERSON

the O
best O
of O

milliners O

and O
they O
treated O
her O
with O
such O
extreme O
kindness O
and O
condescension O
, O
and O
patronised O
her O
so O
insufferably O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
little O
thing O
was O
in O
fact O
perfectly O
dumb O
in O
their O
presence O
, O
and O
to O
all O
outward O
appearance O
as O
stupid O
as O
they O
thought O
her O

She O
made O
efforts O

like O
them O
, O
as O
in O
duty O
bound O
, O

as O
sisters O

She O
passed O
“ O
long O

with O
them O

the O
most O
dreary O

serious O

Miss O

these O
two S-CARDINAL
affectionate O
young O
women O
so O
earnestly O

frequently O
impressed O
upon O
George B-PERSON
Osborne’s E-PERSON
mind O
the O
enormity O
of O
the O
sacrifice O

was O

, O
and O
his O
romantic O
generosity O

throwing O
himself O
away O
upon O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
that O
I’m O
not O
sure O

that O
he O
really O
thought O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
deserving O
characters O
in O
the O
British S-NORP
army O

and O
gave O
himself O
up O

loved O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
easy O
resignation O

Somehow O

dined O
abroad O
six B-DATE

infatuated O
youth O
to O
be O
at O
Miss O

with O
Amelia S-PERSON

the O

supposed O
him O

it O
is O
that O
on O
more O
occasions O
than O
one O
, O

called O
to O
look O
for O
his O

Miss O

was O
very O

know O
about O
the O

would O

At O
which O
kind O
of O
speech O
the O
Captain O
would O
laugh O
in O
rather O
an O
absurd O
constrained O
manner O

turn O
off O

Prince’s O
last O

Carlton B-FAC

“ O
What O

innocent O
it O
is O
, O
that O
pet O

” O
Miss O
Maria S-PERSON
would O
then O
say O
to O
Miss O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
upon O
the O
Captain’s O
departure O
: O
“ O
Did O
you O
see O
how O
he O
blushed O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
poor O
George S-PERSON
on O
duty O
? O
” O
“ O
It’s O
a O
pity O
Frederick B-PERSON
Bulloch E-PERSON
hadn’t O
some O
of O
his O
modesty O
, O
Maria S-PERSON
, O
” O
replies O
the O
elder O
sister O
, O
with O
a O
toss O
of O
her O
head O
. O
“ O
Modesty O
! O
Awkwardness O
you O
mean O
, O
Jane S-PERSON

I O
don’t O
want O
Frederick S-PERSON

trample O

hole O

my O
muslin O

Captain O

did O
in O

at O

Perkins S-PERSON

” O
“ O
In O

he O
, O
he O
! O
How O
could O
he O
? O
Wasn’t O
he O
dancing O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
” O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
when O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
blushed O
so O
, O
and O
looked O
so O
awkward O
, O
he O
remembered O
a O
circumstance O
of O
which O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
inform O
the O
young O
ladies O
, O
viz. O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
calling O
at O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
house O
already O
, O
on O
the O
pretence O
of O
seeing O
George S-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
George S-PERSON
wasn’t O
there O
, O
only O
poor O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
with O
rather O
a O
sad O
wistful O
face O
, O
seated O
near O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
window O
, O
who O
, O
after O
some O
very O
trifling O
stupid O
talk O
, O
ventured O
to O
ask O
, O
was O
there O
any O
truth O
in O
the O
report O
that O
the O
regiment O
was O
soon O
to O
be O
ordered O
abroad O
| | O
and O
had O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
seen O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
that O
day O
? O
The O
regiment O
was O
not O
ordered O
abroad O
as O
yet O
| | O
and O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
not O
seen O
George S-PERSON
. O
“ O
He O
was O
with O
his O
sister O
, O
most O
likely O
, O
” O
the O
Captain O
said O
. O
“ O
Should O
he O
go O
and O
fetch O
the O
truant O
? O
” O
So O
she O
gave O
him O
her O
hand O
kindly O
and O
gratefully O
: O
and O
he O
crossed O
the O
square O
| | O
and O
she O
waited O
and O
waited O
, O
but O
George S-PERSON
never O
came O
. O
Poor O
little O
tender O
heart O
! O
and O
so O
it O
goes O
on O
hoping O
and O
beating O
, O
and O
longing O
and O
trusting O
. O
You O
see O
it O
is O
not O
much O
of O
a O
life O
to O
describe O
. O
There O
is O
not O
much O
of O
what O
you O
call O
incident O
in O
it O
. O
Only O
one S-CARDINAL
feeling O
all O
day O
— O
when O
will O
he O
come O
? O
only O
one O
thought O
to O
sleep O
and O
wake O
upon O
. O
I O
believe O
George S-PERSON
was O
playing O
billiards O
with O
Captain B-PERSON
Cannon E-PERSON
in O
Swallow B-FAC
Street E-FAC
at O
the O
time O
when O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
asking O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
about O
him O
| | O
for O
George S-PERSON
was O
a O
jolly O
sociable O
fellow O
, O
and O
excellent O
in O
all O
games O
of O
skill O
. O
Once O
, O
after O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
absence O
, O
Miss O
Amelia S-PERSON
put O
on O
her O
bonnet O
, O
and O
actually O
invaded O
the O
Osborne S-PERSON
house O
. O
“ O
What O
! O
leave O
our O
brother O
to O
come O
to O
us O
? O
” O
said O
the O
young O
ladies O
. O
“ O
Have O
you O
had O
a O
quarrel O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
Do O
tell O
us O
! O
” O
No O
, O
indeed O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O
quarrel O
. O
“ O
Who O
could O
quarrel O
with O
him O
? O
” O
says O
she O
, O
with O
her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O
She O
only O
came O
over O
to O
— O
to O
see O
her O
dear O
friends O
| | O
they O
had O
not O
met O
for O
so O
long O
. O
And O
this O
day O
she O
was O
so O
perfectly O
stupid O
and O
awkward O
, O
that O
the B-PERSON
Misses I-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
and O
their O
governess O
, O
who O
stared O
after O
her O
as O
she O
went O
sadly O
away O
, O
wondered O
more O
than O
ever O
what O
George S-PERSON
could O
see O
in O
poor O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
Of O
course O
they O
did O
. O
How O
was O
she O
to O
bare O
that O
timid O
little O
heart O
for O
the O
inspection O
of O
those O
young O
ladies O
with O
their O
bold O
black O
eyes O
? O
It O
was O
best O
that O
it O
should O
shrink O
and O
hide O
itself O
. O
I O
know O
the B-PERSON
Misses I-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
were O
excellent O
critics O
of O
a O
Cashmere O
shawl O
, O
or O
a O
pink O
satin O
slip O
| | O
and O
when O
Miss O
Turner S-PERSON
had O
hers O
dyed O
purple O
, O
and O
made O
into O
a O
spencer O
| | O
and O
when O
Miss O
Pickford S-PERSON
had O
her O
ermine O
tippet O
twisted O
into O
a O
muff O
and O
trimmings O
, O
I O
warrant O
you O
the O
changes O
did O
not O
escape O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
intelligent O
young O
women O
before O
mentioned O
. O
But O
there O
are O
things O
, O
look O
you O
, O
of O
a O
finer O
texture O
than O
fur O
or O
satin O
, O
and O
all O
Solomon’s S-NORP
glories O
, O
and O
all O
the O
wardrobe O
of O
the B-PERSON
Queen I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Sheba E-PERSON

— O
things O
whereof O
the O
beauty O
escapes O
the O
eyes O
of O
many O
connoisseurs O
. O
And O
there O
are O
sweet O
modest O
little O
souls O
on O
which O
you O
light O
, O
fragrant O

blooming O
tenderly O
in O
quiet O
shady O

that O

stare O

Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
not O
of O
the O
sunflower O
sort O

and O
I O
say O
it O
is O
out O
of O

This O

very O
first S-ORDINAL

never O

Mr. O

everybody O
praised O

Compare O
such O

Not O

only O
good O
enough O

fairy O

oh O
, O
what O
magnanimity O
to O
stoop O
to O
such O
a O
humble O
Cinderella S-PERSON
! O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
would O
have O
tried O

check O

devotion O
very O
likely O

not O
with O
much O
success O

it O

It O
is O
in O
the O
nature O

instinct O
of O
some O

are O
made O
to O

the O
sort O
that O
best O
likes O
him O

While O
under O
this O
overpowering O
impression O
, O
Miss O
Amelia S-PERSON
neglected O
her O
twelve S-CARDINAL
dear O
friends O

Chiswick S-GPE
most O
cruelly O
, O
as O
such O
selfish O
people O

had O

this O
subject O

of O
course O
, O
to O
think O
about O

Miss O
Saltire S-PERSON
was O
too O
cold O
for O
a O
confidante O
, O

she O
couldn’t O
bring O
her O
mind O
to O
tell O
Miss O

, O
the O
woolly O
- O
haired O
young O
heiress O
from O
St. B-GPE

She O
had O
little O
Laura B-PERSON
Martin E-PERSON
home O
for O
the O
holidays O

and O
my O
belief O
is O
, O
she O
made O
a O
confidante O
of O
her O
, O
and O
promised O
that O
Laura S-PERSON
should O
come O
and O
live O
with O
her O
when O
she O
was O
married O
, O
and O
gave O
Laura S-PERSON
a O
great O
deal O
of O
information O
regarding O
the O
passion O
of O
love O
, O
which O
must O
have O
been O
singularly O
useful O
and O
novel O
to O
that O
little O
person O

Alas O
, O
alas O
! O
I O
fear O
poor O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
had O
not O
a O
well O

regulated O
mind O

What O
were O
her O
parents O
doing O
, O
not O
to O
keep O
this O
little O
heart O
from O
beating O
so O
fast O

Old O

not O

He O
was O
graver O

late O

his O
City O

absorbed O
him O

Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
of O
so O
easy O

uninquisitive O
a O
nature O

that O
she O
wasn’t O
even O
jealous O

Mr. O

away O

Irish S-NORP

the O

much O

ever O
doubted O

for O

George S-PERSON
must O
be O
at O
the B-ORG

with O
the O

too O
tired O
to O
write O
long O

I O
know O
where O

kept O
that O
packet O
she O
had O

can O
steal O
in O

out O

like O
Iachimo S-PERSON

No O

that O
is O

But O
if O
Osborne’s O
were O
short O

it O

Miss O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
letters O

Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON

should O
have O
to O
extend O
this O
novel O

such O
a O
multiplicity O
of O
volumes O

not O
the O
most O
sentimental O
reader O
could O
support O

that O
she O
not O

filled O
sheets O

large O
paper O

crossed O
them O
with O
the O
most O
astonishing O
perverseness O

she O
wrote O
whole O
pages O
out O
of O
poetry O

books O
without O
the O
least O
pity O

that O

underlined O
words O

passages O
with O
quite O
a O
frantic O
emphasis O

, O
in O
fine O

gave O
the O
usual O
tokens O
of O
her O
condition O

She O
wasn’t O
a O
heroine O
. O
Her O
letters O
were O
full O
of O
repetition O
. O
She O
wrote O
rather O
doubtful O
grammar O
sometimes O
, O
and O
in O
her O
verses O
took O
all O
sorts O
of O
liberties O

the O
metre O

oh O

mesdames O

if O

went O

jolly O

Amelia S-PERSON
meanwhile O
, O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
was O
looking O
at O
the O
moon O
, O
which O
was O
shining O
upon O
that O
peaceful O
spot O
, O
as O
well O
as O
upon O
the O
square O
of O
the O
Chatham S-GPE
barracks O
, O
where O
Lieutenant O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
quartered O
, O
and O
thinking O
to O
herself O
how O
her O
hero O
was O
employed O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
is O
visiting O
the O
sentries O
, O
thought O
she O
| | O
perhaps O
he O
is O
bivouacking O
| | O
perhaps O
he O
is O
attending O
the O
couch O
of O
a O
wounded O
comrade O
, O
or O
studying O
the O
art O
of O
war O
up O
in O
his O
own O
desolate O
chamber O
. O
And O
her O
kind O
thoughts O
sped O
away O
as O
if O
they O
were O
angels O
and O
had O
wings O
, O
and O
flying O
down O
the O
river O
to O
Chatham S-GPE
and O
Rochester S-GPE
, O
strove O
to O
peep O
into O
the O
barracks O
where O
George S-PERSON
was O
…. O
All O
things O
considered O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
as O
well O
the O
gates O
were O
shut O
, O
and O
the O
sentry O
allowed O
no O
one O
to O
pass O
| | O
so O
that O
the O
poor O
little O
white O
- O
robed O
angel O
could O
not O
hear O
the O
songs O
those O
young O
fellows O
were O
roaring O
over O
the O
whisky O
- O
punch O
. O
The B-DATE
day E-DATE
after O
the O
little O
conversation O
at O
Chatham S-GPE
barracks O
, O
young O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
to O
show O
that O
he O
would O
be O
as O
good O
as O
his O
word O
, O
prepared O
to O
go O
to O
town O
, O
thereby O
incurring O
Captain O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
applause O
. O
“ O
I O
should O
have O
liked O
to O
make O
her O
a O
little O
present O
, O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
friend O
in O
confidence O
, O
“ O
only O
I O
am O
quite O
out O
of O
cash O
until O
my O
father O
tips O
up O
. O
” O
But O
Dobbin S-PERSON
would O
not O
allow O
this O
good O
nature O
and O
generosity O
to O
be O
balked O
, O
and O
so O
accommodated O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
with O
a O
few O
pound O
notes O
, O
which O
the O
latter O
took O
after O
a O
little O
faint O
scruple O
. O
And O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
would O
have O
bought O
something O
very O
handsome O
for O
Amelia S-PERSON
| | O
only O
, O
getting O
off O
the O
coach O
in O
Fleet B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
he O
was O
attracted O
by O
a O
handsome O
shirt O
- O
pin O
in O
a O
jeweller’s O
window O
, O
which O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
| | O
and O
having O
paid O
for O
that O
, O
had O
very O
little O
money O
to O
spare O
for O
indulging O
in O
any O
further O
exercise O
of O
kindness O
. O
Never O
mind O
: O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
it O
was O
not O
his O
presents O
Amelia S-PERSON
wanted O
. O
When O
he O
came O
to O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
her O
face O
lighted O
up O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
sunshine O
. O
The O
little O
cares O
, O
fears O
, O
tears O
, O
timid O
misgivings O
, O
sleepless O
fancies O
of O
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
many O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
were O
forgotten O
, O
under O
one S-CARDINAL
moment’s O
influence O
of O
that O
familiar O
irresistible O
smile O
. O
He O
beamed O
on O
her O
from O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
door O
— O
magnificent O
, O
with O
ambrosial O
whiskers O
, O
like O

Sambo S-PERSON
, O
whose O

announced O
Captain O
Osbin S-PERSON
( O
having O
conferred O
a O
brevet O
rank O
on O
that O
young O
officer O
) O
blazed O
with O
a O
sympathetic O
grin O
, O
saw O
the O
little O
girl O
start O
, O
and O
flush O

and O
jump O
up O
from O
her O
watching O

place O
in O
the O
window O
, O
and O
Sambo S-PERSON
retreated O
: O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
door O
was O
shut O
, O
she O
went O
fluttering O
to O
Lieutenant O
George B-PERSON
Osborne’s E-PERSON
heart O
as O
if O
it O
was O
the O
only O
natural O
home O
for O
her O
to O
nestle O
in O
. O
Oh O
, O
thou O
poor O
panting O
little O
soul O
! O
The O
very O
finest O
tree O
in O
the O
whole O
forest O
, O
with O
the O
straightest O
stem O
, O
and O
the O
strongest O
arms O
, O
and O
the O
thickest O
foliage O
, O
wherein O
you O
choose O
to O
build O
and O
coo O
, O
may O
be O
marked O
, O
for O
what O
you O
know O
, O
and O
may O
be O
down O
with O
a O
crash O
ere O
long O
. O
What O
an O
old O
, O
old O
simile O
that O
is O
, O
between O
man O
and O
timber O
. O
In O
the O
meanwhile O
, O
George S-PERSON
kissed O
her O
very O
kindly O
on O
her O
forehead O
and O
glistening O
eyes O
, O
and O
was O
very O
gracious O
and O
good O
| | O
and O
she O
thought O
his O
diamond O
shirt O
- O
pin O
( O
which O
she O
had O
not O
known O
him O
to O
wear O
before O
) O
the O
prettiest O
ornament O
ever O
seen O
. O
The O
observant O
reader O
, O
who O
has O
marked O
our O
young O
Lieutenant’s S-NORP
previous O
behaviour O
, O
and O
has O
preserved O
our O
report O
of O
the O
brief O
conversation O
which O
he O
has O
just O
had O
with O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
has O
possibly O
come O
to O
certain O
conclusions O
regarding O
the O
character O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
Some O
cynical O
Frenchman S-NORP
has O
said O
that O
there O
are O
two S-CARDINAL
parties O
to O
a O
love O
- O
transaction O
: O
the O
one O
who O
loves O
and O
the O
other O
who O
condescends O
to O
be O
so O
treated O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
love O
is O
occasionally O
on O
the O
man’s O
side O
| | O
perhaps O
on O
the O
lady’s O
. O
Perhaps O
some O
infatuated O
swain O
has O
ere O
this O
mistaken O
insensibility O
for O
modesty O
, O
dulness O
for O
maiden O
reserve O
, O
mere O
vacuity O
for O
sweet O
bashfulness O
, O
and O
a O
goose O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
for O
a O
swan O
. O
Perhaps O
some O
beloved O
female O
subscriber O
has O
arrayed O
an O
ass O
in O
the O
splendour O
and O
glory O
of O
her O
imagination O
| | O
admired O
his O
dulness O
as O
manly O
simplicity O
| | O
worshipped O
his O
selfishness O
as O
manly O
superiority O
| | O
treated O
his O
stupidity O
as O
majestic O
gravity O
, O
and O
used O
him O
as O
the O
brilliant O
fairy O
Titania S-PERSON
did O
a O
certain O
weaver O
at O
Athens S-GPE
. O
I O
think O
I O
have O
seen O
such O
comedies O
of O
errors O
going O
on O
in O
the O
world O
. O
But O
this O
is O
certain O
, O
that O
Amelia S-PERSON
believed O
her O
lover O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
gallant O
and O
brilliant O
men O
in O
the O
empire O
| | O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
Lieutenant B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
thought O
so O
too O
. O
He O
was O
a O
little O
wild O
: O
how O
many O
young O
men O
are O
| | O
and O
don’t O
girls O
like O
a O
rake O
better O
than O
a O
milksop O
? O
He O
hadn’t O
sown O
his O
wild O
oats O
as O
yet O
, O
but O
he O
would O
soon O
: O
and O
quit O
the O
army O
now O
that O
peace O
was O
proclaimed O
| | O
the O
Corsican S-NORP
monster O
locked O
up O
at O
Elba S-PERSON

promotion O
by O
consequence O
over O

and O
no O
chance O
left O
for O
the O
display O
of O
his O
undoubted O
military O
talents O
and O
valour O
: O
and O
his O
allowance O
, O
with O
Amelia’s O
settlement O
, O
would O
enable O
them O
to O
take O
a O
snug O
place O
in O
the O
country O
somewhere O
, O
in O
a O
good O
sporting O
neighbourhood O
| | O
and O
he O
would O
hunt O
a O
little O
, O
and O
farm O
a O
little O
| | O
and O
they O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
. O
As O
for O
remaining O
in O
the O
army O
as O
a O
married O
man O
, O
that O
was O
impossible O
. O

died O
with O
laughing O
at O
Osborne’s S-ORG
stories O
about O
Mrs. O
Major B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
He O
loved O
her O
much O
too O
fondly O
to O
subject O
her O
to O
that O
horrid O
woman O

her O
vulgarities O
, O
and O
the O
rough O
treatment O
of O
a O

He O
didn’t O
care O
for O
himself O
— O
not O
he O

his O
dear O
little O

as O
the O

only O
that O

a O

where O
he O
left O
her O
talking O

It O
was O
not O
so O
with O
old O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
When O
that O
gentleman O
came O
from O
the O
City O

was O
welcomed O
in O
the O
drawing O
room O
by O
his O
daughters O

the O
elegant O
Miss O
Wirt S-PERSON

they O
saw O
at O
once O
by O
his O
face O
— O
which O
was O
puffy O
, O
solemn O
, O
and O
yellow O
at O
the O
best O
of O

by O
the O
scowl O

twitching O
of O
his O
black O
eye O

brows O

that O
the O
heart O
within O
his O
large O

disturbed O

When O
Amelia S-PERSON
stepped O
forward O

him O
, O
which O
she O
always O
did O
with O
great O
trembling O

timidity O
, O
he O
gave O
a O
surly O
grunt O
of O
recognition O
, O
and O
dropped O
the O
little O
hand O
out O
of O
his O
great O
hirsute O
paw O
without O
any O
attempt O

He O
looked O
round O
gloomily O
at O
his O
eldest O
daughter O

who O
, O
comprehending O
the O
meaning O
of O
his O
look O

which O
asked O
unmistakably O
, O
“ O
Why O
the O
devil O
is O
she O
here O
? O
” O
said O
at O

with O

DINNER O

Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
scowled O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
trembled O
. O
A O
telegraphic O
communication O
of O
eyes O
passed O
between O
the O
other O
three S-CARDINAL
ladies O
. O
The O
obedient O
bell O
in O
the O
lower O
regions O
began O
ringing O
the O
announcement O
of O
the O
meal O

The O
tolling O
over O

the O
head O

his O
hands O
into O
the O
great O
tailpockets O
of O
his O
great O
blue O
coat O
and O
brass O
buttons O
, O
and O
without O
waiting O
for O
a O
further O
announcement O
, O
strode O
down O
stairs O
alone O
, O
scowling O
over O
his O
shoulder O
at O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
females O
. O
“ O
What’s O
the O
matter O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
” O
asked O
one O
of O
the O
other O

as O
they O
rose O

tripped O
gingerly O
behind O

“ O

so O
, O
trembling O

in O
silence O
, O
this O
hushed O
female O
company O
followed O
their O
dark O
leader O
. O
They O
took O
their O
places O
in O
silence O
. O
He O
growled O
out O
a O
blessing O
, O
which O
sounded O
as O
gruffly O
as O
a O
curse O
. O
The O
great O
silver O
dish O
- O
covers O
were O
removed O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
trembled O
in O
her O
place O
, O
for O
she O
was O
next O
to O
the O
awful O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
and O
alone O
on O
her O
side O
of O
the O
table O
— O
the O
gap O
being O
occasioned O
by O
the O
absence O
of O
George S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Soup O
? O
” O
says O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
clutching O
the O
ladle O
, O
fixing O
his O
eyes O
on O
her O
, O
in O
a O
sepulchral O
tone O

and O
having O
helped O
her O
and O
the O
rest O
, O
did O
not O
speak O
for O
a O
while O

“ O

Miss I-WORK_OF_ART
Sedley’s E-WORK_OF_ART

at O
last O
he O
said O

“ O

can’t O
eat O
the O
soup O

no O
more O

beastly O

away O
the O

and O
to O
- O
morrow O
turn O
the O
clock O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
Jane S-PERSON
. O
” O
Having O
concluded O
his O
observations O
upon O
the O
soup O
, O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
made O
a O
few O
curt O
remarks O
respecting O
the O
fish O
, O
also O
of O
a O
savage O
and O
satirical O
tendency O
, O
and O
cursed O
Billingsgate S-PERSON
with O
an O
emphasis O
quite O
worthy O
of O
the O
place O
. O
Then O
he O
lapsed O
into O
silence O
, O
and O
swallowed O
sundry O
glasses O
of O
wine O
, O
looking O
more O
and O
more O
terrible O
, O
till O
a O
brisk O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
told O
of O
George’s S-PERSON
arrival O
, O
when O
everybody O
began O
to O
rally O
. O
“ O
He O
could O
not O
come O
before O

General O
Daguilet S-PERSON
had O
kept O
him O
waiting O
at O
the B-ORG
Horse I-ORG

Never O
mind O
soup O
or O
fish O

Give O
him O
anything O
— O
he O
didn’t O
care O
what O
. O
Capital O
mutton O
— O
capital O
everything O
. O
” O
His O
good O
humour O
contrasted O
with O
his O
father’s O
severity O
| | O
and O
he O
rattled O
on O
unceasingly O
during O
dinner O
, O
to O
the O
delight O
of O
all O
— O
of O
one O
especially O
, O
who O
need O
not O
be O
mentioned O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
young O
ladies O
had O
discussed O
the O
orange O
and O
the O
glass O
of O
wine O
which O
formed O
the O
ordinary O
conclusion O
of O
the O
dismal O
banquets O
at O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
house O
, O
the O
signal O
to O
make O
sail O
for O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
was O
given O
, O
and O
they O
all O
arose O
and O
departed O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
hoped O
George S-PERSON
would O
soon O
join O
them O
there O
. O
She O
began O
playing O
some O
of O
his O
favourite O
waltzes O
( O
then O
newly O
imported O
) O
at O
the O
great O
carved O
- O
legged O
, O
leather O
- O
cased O
grand O
piano O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
overhead O
. O
This O
little O
artifice O
did O
not O
bring O
him O
. O
He O
was O
deaf O
to O
the O
waltzes O
| | O
they O
grew O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
| | O
the O
discomfited O
performer O
left O
the O
huge O
instrument O
presently O
| | O
and O
though O
her O
three S-CARDINAL
friends O
performed O
some O
of O
the O
loudest O
and O
most O
brilliant O
new O
pieces O
of O
their O
rèpertoire O
, O
she O
did O
not O
hear O
a O
single O
note O
, O
but O
state O
thinking O
, O
and O
boding O
evil O
. O
Old O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
scowl O
, O
terrific O
always O
, O
had O
never O
before O
looked O
so O
deadly O
to O
her O
. O
His O
eyes O
followed O
her O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
guilty O
of O
something O
. O
When O
they O
brought O
her O
coffee O
, O
she O
started O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
cup O
of O
poison O
which O
Mr. O
Hicks S-PERSON
, O
the O
butler O
, O
wished O
to O
propose O
to O
her O
. O
What O
mystery O
was O
there O
lurking O
? O
Oh O
, O
those O
women O
. O
They O
nurse O
and O
cuddle O
their O
presentiments O
, O
and O
make O
darlings O
of O
their O
ugliest O
thoughts O
, O
as O
they O
do O
of O
their O
deformed O
children O
. O
The O
gloom O
on O
the O
paternal O
countenance O
had O
also O
impressed O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
with O
anxiety O
. O
With O
such O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
a O
look O
so O
decidedly O
bilious O
, O
how O
was O
he O
to O
extract O
that O
money O
from O
the O
governor O
, O
of O
which O
George S-PERSON
was O
consumedly O
in O
want O
? O
He O
began O
praising O
his O
father’s O
wine O
. O
That O
was O
generally O
a O
successful O
means O
of O
cajoling O
the O
old O
gentleman O
. O
“ O
We O
never O
got O
such O
Madeira S-GPE

the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Indies E-GPE

sir O
, O
as O
yours O
. O
Colonel O
Heavytop S-PERSON
took O
off O
three S-CARDINAL
bottles O
of O
that O
you O
sent O
me O
down O
, O
under O
his O
belt O
the O
other O
day O
. O
” O
“ O
Did O
he O
? O
” O
said O
the O
old O
gentleman O
. O
“ O
It O
stands O
me O
in O
eight B-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
a O
bottle O

” O
“ O
Will O
you O
take O
six B-MONEY
guineas E-MONEY
a O
dozen O
for O
it O
, O
sir O
? O
” O
said O
George S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
. O
“ O
There’s O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
men O
in O
the O
kingdom O
wants O
some O

” O
“ O
Does O
he O
? O
” O
growled O
the O
senior O
. O
“ O
Wish O
he O
may O
get O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
When O
General O
Daguilet S-PERSON
was O
at O
Chatham S-GPE
, O
sir O
, O
Heavytop S-PERSON
gave O
him O
a O
breakfast O
, O
and O
asked O
me O
for O
some O
of O
the O
wine O
. O
The O
General O
liked O
it O
just O
as O
well O
— O
wanted O
a O
pipe O
for O
the O
Commander O

his O

“ O
It O
is O
devilish O
fine O
wine O

said O
the O
Eyebrows O
, O
and O
they O
looked O
more O
good O
- O
humoured O

and O
George S-PERSON
was O
going O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
this O
complacency O
, O
and O
bring O
the O
supply O
question O
on O
the O
mahogany O
, O
when O
the O
father O
, O
relapsing O
into O
solemnity O
, O
though O
rather O
cordial O
in O
manner O
, O
bade O
him O
ring O
the O
bell O
for O
claret O
. O
“ O
And O
we’ll O
see O

talk O

you O

” O
Amelia S-PERSON
heard O
the O
claret O
bell O
ringing O
as O
she O
sat O
nervously O
upstairs O
. O
She O
thought O
, O
somehow O
, O
it O
was O
a O
mysterious O
and O
presentimental O
bell O

Of O
the O
presentiments O

some O
people O
are O
always O

some O
surely O
must O

What O
I O

the O
old O

after O
slowly O
smacking O
his O
first S-ORDINAL

— O
“ O

The O
old O
gentleman O
pronounced O
these O
aristocratic O

with O
the O
greatest O
gusto O

Whenever O
he O
met O
a O
great O

grovelled O

came O
home O

looked O
out O
his O
history O

introduced O
his O

fell O
down O

put O
a O
little O
hand O
into O
his O

he O
stepped O
forward O
eagerly O
to O
meet O
her O

gave O
a O
glance O
of O
great O
scorn O
at O
the O
bewildered O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
and O
beckoning O
the O
young O
Guardsman O
out O
of O
the O
back O
drawing O

room O

led O
him O
downstairs O
into O
that O
now O
desolate O
dining O

parlour O
, O
where O
so O
many O
a O
good O
dinner O
had O
been O
celebrated O
. O
Here O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
talked O
for O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
, O
discussing O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
the O
symptoms O
of O
the O
old O
invalid O
above O
stairs O

at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
period O
the O
parlour O
bell O
was O
rung O
briskly O
, O
and O
answered O
on O
that O
instant O
by O
Mr. O
Bowls S-PERSON
, O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
large O
confidential O
butler O
( O
who O
, O
indeed O
, O
happened O
to O
be O
at O
the O
keyhole O
during O
the O
most O
part O
of O
the O
interview O
) O

and O
the O
Captain O
coming O
out O
, O
curling O
his O
moustachios O
, O
mounted O
the O
black O
charger O
pawing O
among O
the O
straw O
, O
to O
the O
admiration O
of O
the O
little O
blackguard O
boys O
collected O
in O
the O
street O
. O
He O
looked O
in O
at O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
window O
, O
managing O
his O
horse O
, O
which O
curvetted O
and O
capered O
beautifully O
— O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
instant O
the O
young O
person O
might O
be O
seen O
at O
the O
window O
, O
when O
her O
figure O
vanished O
, O
and O
, O
doubtless O
, O
she O
went O
upstairs O
again O
to O
resume O
the O
affecting O
duties O
of O
benevolence O
. O
Who O
could O
this O
young O
woman O
be O
, O
I O
wonder O
? O
That O
evening O
a O
little O
dinner O
for O
two S-CARDINAL
persons O
was O
laid O
in O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
— O
when O
Mrs. O
Firkin S-PERSON
, O
the O
lady’s O
maid O
, O
pushed O
into O
her O
mistress’s O
apartment O
, O
and O
bustled O
about O
there O
during O
the O
vacancy O
occasioned O
by O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
new O
nurse O
— O
and O
the O
latter O
and O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
sat O
down O
to O
the O
neat O
little O
meal O
. O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
so O
much O
choked O
by O
emotion O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
take O
a O
morsel O
of O
meat O
. O
The O
young O
person O
carved O
a O
fowl O
with O
the O
utmost O
delicacy O
, O
and O
asked O
so O
distinctly O
for O
egg O
- O
sauce O
, O
that O
poor O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
before O
whom O
that O
delicious O
condiment O
was O
placed O
, O
started O
, O
made O
a O
great O
clattering O
with O
the O
ladle O
, O
and O
once O
more O
fell O
back O
in O
the O
most O
gushing O
hysterical O
state O
. O
“ O
Had O
you O
not O
better O
give O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
? O
” O
said O
the O
person O
to O
Mr. O
Bowls S-PERSON
, O
the O
large O
confidential O
man O
. O
He O
did O
so O
. O
Briggs S-PERSON
seized O
it O
mechanically O
, O
gasped O
it O
down O
convulsively O
, O
moaned O
a O
little O
, O
and O
began O
to O
play O
with O
the O
chicken O
on O
her O
plate O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
we O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
help O
each O
other O
, O
” O
said O
the O
person O
with O
great O
suavity O
: O
“ O

have O
no O

” O
He O
went O
downstairs O
, O
where O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
he O
vented O
the O
most O
horrid O
curses O
upon O
the O
unoffending O
footman O
, O
his O
subordinate O
. O
“ O
It O

on O
so O

” O
the O
young O
lady O
said O
, O
with O
a O
cool O
, O
slightly O
sarcastic O

air O

gurgled O
out O
Briggs S-PERSON
in O
an O
agony O
of O
renewed O
grief O

Briggs S-PERSON
and O
her O
grief O
, O
which O
Rebecca S-PERSON
described O
to O
her O
. O
Briggs’ S-PERSON
weeping O
snuffle O
, O
and O
her O
manner O
of O
using O
the O
handkerchief O
, O
were O
so O
completely O
rendered O
, O
that O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
became O
quite O
cheerful O
, O
to O
the O
admiration O
of O
the O
doctors O
when O
they O
visited O
her O
, O
who O
usually O
found O
this O
worthy O
woman O
of O
the O
world O
, O
when O
the O
least O
sickness O
attacked O
her O
, O
under O
the O
most O
abject O
depression O
and O
terror O
of O
death O
. O
Captain O
Crawley S-PERSON
came O
every O
day O
, O
and O
received O
bulletins O
from O
Miss O
Rebecca S-PERSON
respecting O
his O
aunt’s O
health O
. O
This O
improved O
so O
rapidly O
, O
that O
poor O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
allowed O
to O
see O
her O
patroness O
| | O
and O
persons O
with O
tender O
hearts O
may O
imagine O
the O
smothered O
emotions O
of O
that O
sentimental O
female O
, O
and O
the O
affecting O
nature O
of O
the O
interview O
. O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
liked O
to O
have O
Briggs S-PERSON
in O
a O
good O
deal O
soon O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
used O
to O
mimic O
her O
to O
her O
face O
with O
the O
most O
admirable O
gravity O
, O
thereby O
rendering O
the O
imitation O
doubly O
piquant O
to O
her O
worthy O
patroness O
. O
The O
causes O
which O
had O
led O
to O
the O
deplorable O
illness O
of O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
departure O
from O
her O
brother’s O
house O
in O
the O
country O
, O
were O
of O
such O
an O
unromantic O
nature O
that O
they O
are O
hardly O
fit O
to O
be O
explained O
in O
this O
genteel O
and O
sentimental O
novel O
. O
For O
how O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
hint O
of O
a O
delicate O
female O
, O
living O
in O
good O
society O
, O
that O
she O
ate O
and O
drank O
too O
much O
, O
and O
that O
a O
hot O
supper O
of O
lobsters O
profusely O
enjoyed O
at O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
was O
the O
reason O
of O
an O
indisposition O
which O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
herself O
persisted O
was O
solely O
attributable O
to O
the O
dampness O
of O
the O
weather O
? O
The O
attack O
was O
so O
sharp O
that O
Matilda S-PERSON
— O
as O
his O
Reverence O
expressed O
it O
— O
was O
very O
nearly O
“ O
off O
the O
hooks O
| | O
” O
all O
the O
family O
were O
in O
a O
fever O
of O
expectation O
regarding O
the O
will O
, O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
was O
making O
sure O
of O
at B-QUANTITY
least I-QUANTITY
forty I-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
before O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
London S-GPE
season O
. O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
sent O
over O
a O
choice O
parcel O
of O
tracts O
, O
to O
prepare O
her O
for O
the O
change O
from O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
and O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
for O
another O
world O
| | O
but O
a O
good O
doctor O
from O
Southampton S-GPE
being O
called O
in O
in O
time O
, O
vanquished O
the O
lobster O
which O
was O
no O
nearly O
fatal O
to O
her O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
sufficient O
strength O
to O
enable O
her O
to O
return O
to O
London S-GPE
. O
The O
Baronet S-PERSON
did O
not O
disguise O
his O
exceeding O
mortification O
at O
the O
turn O
which O
affairs O
took O
. O
While O
everybody O
was O
attending O
on O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
and O
messengers O
every O
hour O
from O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
were O
carrying O
news O
of O
her O
health O
to O
the O
affectionate O
folks O
there O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lady O
in O
another O
part O
of O
the O
house O
, O
being O
exceedingly O
ill O
, O
of O
whom O
no O
one O
took O
any O
notice O
at O
all O
| | O
and O
this O
was O
the O
lady O
of O
Crawley S-GPE
herself O
. O
The O
good O
doctor O
shook O
his O
head O
after O
seeing O
her O
| | O
to O
which O
visit O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
consented O
, O
as O
it O
could O
be O
paid O
without O
a O
fee O
| | O
and O
she O
was O
left O
fading O
away O
in O
her O
lonely O
chamber O
, O
with O
no O
more O
heed O
paid O
to O
her O
than O
to O
a O
weed O
in O
the O
park O
. O
The O
young O
ladies O
, O
too O
, O
lost O
much O
of O
the O
inestimable O
benefit O
of O
their O
governess’s O
instruction O
. O
So O
affectionate O
a O
nurse O
was O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
that O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
would O
take O
her O
medicines O
from O
no O
other O
hand O
. O
Firkin S-PERSON
had O
been O
deposed O
long O
before O
her O
mistress’s O
departure O
from O
the O
country O
. O
That O
faithful O
attendant O
found O
a O
gloomy O
consolation O
on O
returning O
to O
London S-GPE
, O
in O
seeing O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
suffer O
the O
same O
pangs O
of O
jealousy O
and O
undergo O
the O
same O
faithless O
treatment O
to O
which O
she O
herself O
had O
been O
subject O
. O
Captain O
Rawdon S-PERSON
got O
an O
extension O
of O
leave O
on O
his O
aunt’s O
illness O
, O
and O
remained O
dutifully O
at O
home O
. O
He O
was O
always O
in O
her O
antechamber O
. O
( O
She O
lay O
sick O
in O
the O
state O
bed O
- O
room O
, O
into O
which O
you O
entered O
by O
the O
little O
blue O
saloon O
. O
) O
His O
father O
was O
always O
meeting O
him O
there O
| | O
or O
if O
he O
came O
down O
the O
corridor O
ever O
so O
quietly O
his O
father’s O
door O
was O
sure O
to O
open O
, O
and O
the O
hyæna O
face O
of O
the O
old O
gentleman O
to O
glare O
out O
. O
What O
was O
it O
set O
one O
to O
watch O
the O
other O
so O
? O
A O
generous O
rivalry O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
as O
to O
which O
should O
be O
most O
attentive O
to O
the O
dear O
sufferer O
in O
the O
state O
bed- O
room O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
used O
to O
come O
out O
and O
comfort O
both O
of O
them O
| | O
or O
one O
or O
the O
other O
of O
them O
rather O
. O
Both O
of O
these O
worthy O
gentlemen O
were O
most O
anxious O
to O
have O
news O
of O
the O
invalid O
from O
her O
little O
confidential O
messenger O
. O
At O
dinner O
— O
to O
which O
meal O
she O
descended O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
— O
she O
kept O
the O
peace O
between O
them O
: O
after O
which O
she O
disappeared O
for O
the O
night O
| | O
when O
Rawdon S-PERSON
would O
ride O
over O
to O
the O
depôt O
of O
the O
150th S-ORDINAL
at O
Mudbury S-GPE
, O
leaving O
his O
Papa S-PERSON
to O
the O
society O
of O
Mr. O
Horrocks S-PERSON
and O
his O
rum O
and O
water O
. O
She O
passed O
as O
weary O
a O
fortnight O
as O
ever O
mortal O
spent O
in O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
sick O
- O
room O
| | O
but O
her O
little O
nerves O
seemed O
to O
be O
of O
iron O
, O
as O
she O
was O
quite O
unshaken O
by O
the O
duty O
and O
the O
tedium O
of O
the O
sick O
- O
chamber O
. O
She O
never O
told O
until O
long O
afterwards O
how O
painful O
that O
duty O
was O
| | O
how O
peevish O
a O
patient O
was O
the O
jovial O
old O
lady O
| | O
how O
angry O
| | O
how O
sleepless O
| | O
in O
what O
horrors O
of O
death O
| | O
during O
what O
long O
nights O
she O
lay O
moaning O
, O
and O
in O
almost O
delirious O
agonies O
respecting O
that O
future O
world O
which O
she O
quite O
ignored O
when O
she O
was O
in O
good O
health O
. O
— O
Picture O
to O
yourself O
, O
oh O
fair O
young O
reader O
, O
a O
worldly O
, O
selfish O
, O
graceless O
, O
thankless O
, O
religionless O
old O
woman O
, O
writhing O
in O
pain O
and O
fear O
, O
and O
without O
her O
wig O
. O
Picture O
her O
to O
yourself O
, O
and O
ere O
you O
be O
old O
, O
learn O
to O
love O
and O
pray O
! O
Sharp S-PERSON
watched O
this O
graceless O
bedside O
with O
indomitable O
patience O
. O
Nothing O
escaped O
her O
| | O
and O
, O
like O
a O
prudent O
steward O
, O
she O
found O
a O
use O
for O
everything O
. O
She O
told O
many O
a O
good O
story O
about O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
illness O
in O
after O
days O
, O
— O
stories O
which O
made O
the O
lady O
blush O
through O
her O
artificial O
carnations O
. O
During O
the O
illness O
she O
was O
never O
out O
of O
temper O
| | O
always O
alert O
| | O
she O
slept O
light O
, O
having O
a O
perfectly O
clear O
conscience O
| | O
and O
could O
take O
that O
refreshment O
at O
almost O
any O
minute’s O
warning O
. O
And O
so O
you O
saw O
very O
few O
traces O
of O
fatigue O
in O
her O
appearance O
. O
Her O
face O
might O
be O
a O
trifle O
paler O
, O
and O
the O
circles O
round O
her O
eyes O
a O
little O
blacker O
than O
usual O
| | O
but O
whenever O
she O
came O
out O
from O
the O
sick O
- O
room O
she O
was O
always O
smiling O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
neat O
, O
and O
looked O
as O
trim O
in O
her O
little O
dressing O
- O
gown O
and O
cap O
, O
as O
in O
her O
smartest O
evening O
suit O
. O
The O
Captain O
thought O
so O
, O
and O
raved O
about O
her O
in O
uncouth O
convulsions O
. O
The O
barbed O
shaft O
of O
love O
had O
penetrated O
his O
dull O
hide O
. O
Six B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
— O
appropinquity O
— O
opportunity O
— O
had O
victimised O
him O
completely O
. O
He O
made O
a O
confidante O
of O
his O
aunt O
at O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
, O
of O
all O
persons O
in O
the O
world O
. O
She O
rallied O
him O
about O
it O
| | O
she O
had O
perceived O
his O
folly O
| | O
she O
warned O
him O
| | O
she O
finished O
by O
owning O
that O
little O
Sharp S-PERSON
was O
the O
most O
clever O
, O
droll O
, O
odd O
, O
good O
- O
natured O
, O
simple O
, O
kindly O
creature O
in O
England S-GPE
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
must O
not O
trifle O
with O
her O
affections O
, O
though O
— O
dear O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
would O
never O
pardon O
him O
for O
that O
| | O
for O
she O
, O
too O
, O
was O
quite O
overcome O
by O
the O
little O
governess O
, O
and O
loved O
Sharp S-PERSON
like O
a O
daughter O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
must O
go O
away O
— O
go O
back O
to O
his O
regiment O
and O
naughty O
London S-GPE
and O
not O
play O
with O
a O
poor O
artless O
girl’s O
feelings O
. O
Many O
and O
many O
a O
time O
this O
good O
- O
natured O
lady O
, O
compassionating O
the O
forlorn O
life O
- O
guardsman’s O
condition O
, O
gave O
him O
an O
opportunity O
of O
seeing O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
at O
the O
Rectory O
, O
and O
of O
walking O
home O
with O
her O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
. O
When O
men O
of O
a O
certain O
sort O
, O
ladies O
, O
are O
in O
love O

they O
see O
the O
hook O

the O
string O

and O
the O
whole O
apparatus O
with O
which O
they O
are O
to O
be O
taken O

they O
gorge O
the O
bait O

they O
must O
come O
to O
it O

they O
must O
swallow O
it O

and O
are O
presently O
struck O
and O
landed O
gasping O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
saw O
there O
was O
a O
manifest O
intention O
on O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
part O
to O
captivate O
him O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
not O
very O
wise O

but O
he O
was O
a O
man O
about O
town O

and O
had O
seen O
several B-DATE
seasons E-DATE
. O
A O
light O
dawned O
upon O
his O
dusky O
soul O
, O
as O
he O
thought O

through O
a O
speech O
of O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Mark O
my O
words O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON

“ O
You O

“ O

rallied O
her O
about O

looked O

full O
in O

agitated O

She O
was O
gone O

She O
drove O
out O
with O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON

day O

was O
before O
the O
latter’s O
illness O

dinner O
she O
was O
unusually O
brilliant O

lively O

take O
no O

the O
clumsy O

Skirmishes O

perpetually O

the O
little O
campaign O

tedious O

similar O
in O

The O
Crawley S-GPE
heavy O
cavalry O
was O
maddened O
by O
defeat O

routed O
every O

If O
the B-PERSON
Baronet I-PERSON

had O
not O

the O
fear O

losing O
his O

their O
invaluable O
governess O

seemed O
a O
desert O
without O
her O

so O
useful O

pleasant O

Rebecca S-PERSON
made O
herself O

now O

his O
little O
secretary O

away O

And O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
see O
how O
necessary O
such O
an O
amanuensis O
was O
to O
him O
, O
by O
the O
tenor O

spelling O

the O
numerous O
letters O

sent O
to O
her O

entreating O
her O

Almost O
every O
day O
brought O
a O
frank O
from O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON

enclosing O
the O
most O
urgent O
prayers O
to O
Becky S-PERSON

her O
return O

conveying O
pathetic O
statements O

the O
neglected O
state O

his O
daughters’ O
education O

of O
which O
documents O
Miss O

took O
very O
little O
heed O

Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
not O
formally O
dismissed O

her O

by O
no O

the O
latter O
regularly O

Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC

Like O
many O
wealthy O
people O
, O
it O
was O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
habit O
to O
accept O
as O
much O
service O
as O
she O
could O
get O
from O
her O
inferiors O

good O

naturedly O
to O
take O
leave O

she O
no O
longer O
found O
them O
useful O

Gratitude O
among O
certain O
rich O
folks O
is O
scarcely O
natural O
or O
to O
be O
thought O
of O

They O
take O
needy O
people’s O
services O
as O

Nor O
have O
you O
, O
O O
poor O
parasite O

humble O
hanger O

on O
, O
much O
reason O
to O
complain O
! O
Your O
friendship O
for O
Dives S-WORK_OF_ART
is O
about O
as O
sincere O
as O
the O
return O
which O
it O
usually O
gets O

It O
is O
money O

not O

upon O
whom O
these O
treasures O

were O
lavished O

had O
not O
a O
lurking O
suspicion O
all O
the O
while O
of O
her O
affectionate O
nurse O

friend O

It O
must O
have O
often O
crossed O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
mind O
that O
nobody O
does O
anything O
for O
nothing O
. O
If O
she O
measured O
her O
own O
feeling O
towards O
the O
world O
, O
she O
must O
have O
been O
pretty O
well O
able O
to O
gauge O
those O
of O
the O
world O
, O
towards O
herself O

and O
perhaps O
she O
reflected O
, O
that O
it O
is O
the O
ordinary O
lot O
of O
people O
to O
have O
no O
friends O
if O
they O
themselves O
care O
for O
nobody O

Well O
, O
meanwhile O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
the O
greatest O
comfort O
and O
convenience O
to O
her O
, O
and O
she O
gave O
her O
a O
couple O
of O
new O
gowns O
, O
and O
an O
old O
necklace O
and O
shawl O
, O
and O
showed O
her O
friendship O
by O
abusing O
all O
her O
intimate O
acquaintances O
to O
her O
new O
confidante O
( O
than O
which O
there O
can’t O
be O
a O
more O
touching O
proof O
of O
regard O
) O
, O
and O
meditated O
vaguely O
some O
great O
future O
benefit O
— O
to O
marry O
her O
perhaps O
to O
Clump O
, O
the O
apothecary O

to O
settle O
her O
in O
some O

at O

London S-GPE

When O

descended O
to O
the O
drawing O

Becky S-PERSON
sang O
to O
her O

otherwise O
amused O
her O

was O
well O
enough O

nature O

actually O
induce O

to O
Russell B-FAC

Ere O
that O

many O
notes O

passed O

as O
may O

imagined O

between O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

During O
the O
months O

Rebecca’s S-GPE

in O
Hampshire S-GPE

the O
eternal O
friendship O
had O
( O
must O
it O

owned O

suffered O
considerable O
diminution O

grown O
so O
decrepit O

feeble O
with O
old O
age O
as O
to O
threaten O
demise O
altogether O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
both O
girls O
had O
their O
own O
real O
affairs O
to O
think O
of O
: O
Rebecca S-PERSON
her O
advance O
with O
her O
employers O
— O
Amelia S-PERSON
her O
own O
absorbing O
topic O
. O
When O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
girls O
met O
, O
and O
flew O
into O
each O
other’s O
arms O
with O
that O
impetuosity O
which O
distinguishes O
the O
behaviour O
of O
young O
ladies O
towards O
each O
other O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
performed O
her O
part O
of O
the O
embrace O
with O
the O
most O
perfect O
briskness O
and O
energy O
. O
Poor O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
blushed O
as O
she O
kissed O
her O
friend O
, O
and O
thought O
she O
had O
been O
guilty O
of O
something O
very O
like O
coldness O
towards O
her O
. O
Their O
first S-ORDINAL
interview O
was O
but O
a O
very O
short O
one O

Amelia S-PERSON
was O
just O
ready O
to O
go O
out O
for O
a O
walk O

Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
waiting O
in O
her O
carriage O

themselves O

gazing O

as O
one S-CARDINAL

when O
Amelia S-PERSON

down O

her O
kind O
smiling O

Rebecca S-PERSON

an O
invitation O
to O
her O
darling O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
, O
was O
ready O
enough O
to O
accept O
it O
when O
she O
heard O
that O
George S-PERSON
was O
to O
be O
of O
the O
party O
. O
It O
was O
arranged O
that O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
to O
spend O
the O
morning O
with O
the O
ladies O
of O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC

where O
all O
were O
very O
kind O
to O
her O

Rebecca S-PERSON
patronised O
her O
with O
calm O
superiority O
: O
she O
was O
so O
much O
the O
cleverer O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

and O
her O
friend O
so O
gentle O

that O
she O
always O
yielded O
, O
when O
anybody O
chose O
to O
command O
, O

so O
took O
Rebecca’s O
orders O
with O
perfect O
meekness O

good O
humour O
. O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
graciousness O
was O
also O
remarkable O

She O
continued O
her O
raptures O
about O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
talked O
about O
her O
before O
her O
face O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
doll O
, O
or O
a O
servant O

a O
picture O

admired O
her O

the O
most O
benevolent O
wonder O
possible O

I O
admire O
that O
admiration O
which O
the O
genteel O
world O
sometimes O
extends O
to O
the O
commonalty O

no O
more O

of O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
ladies O

Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC

did O
not O
find O
honest O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
the O
most O
agreeable O

She O
sympathised O
with O
Briggs S-PERSON

with O
all O
neglected O

gentle O
people O
: O
she O
wasn’t O
what O

take O
the O

was O
offered O
for O
his O

“ O
She’d S-PERSON

the O

in O
a O
rapture O

the O
Lieutenant O
, O
by O
way O
of O
beginning O
the O

agreeably O
asked O
Rebecca S-PERSON
how O
she O
liked O
her O
new O

“ O
My O
place O

coolly O
, O
“ O
how O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
remind O
me O

it O
! O
It’s O
a O
tolerably O
good O

the O

pretty O
good O

not O
so O
good O

Miss O
Wirt’s S-PERSON
, O
I O
believe O
, O
with O
your O
sisters O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC

How O
are O
those O
young O

— O
not O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
ask O

” O
“ O
Why O
not O
? O
” O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
, O
amazed O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
they O
never O
condescended O
to O
speak O
to O
me O
, O
or O
to O
ask O
me O
into O
their O
house O
, O
whilst O
I O
was O
staying O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON

but O
we O
poor O
governesses O
, O
you O
know O
, O
are O
used O
to O
slights O
of O
this O

“ O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
! O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
ejaculated O
. O
“ O
At O
least O
in O
some O
families O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
continued O
. O
“ O
You O
can’t O
think O
what O
a O
difference O
there O
is O
though O
, O
We O
are O
not O
so O
wealthy O
in O
Hampshire S-GPE

you O
lucky O
folks O
of O
the O
City O

then O
I O
am O
in O
a O
gentleman’s O
family O

I O
suppose O
you O

Sir O

refused O

And O
you O
see O
how O
I O
am O
treated O

I O
am O
pretty O

Indeed O
it O
is O
rather O
a O
good O

But O
how O
very O
good O
of O
you O
to O
inquire O

” O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
quite O
savage O
. O
The O
little O
governess O
patronised O
him O
and O
persiffléd O
him O
until O
this O
young O
British S-NORP

felt O
quite O
uneasy O

nor O
could O
he O
muster O
sufficient O
presence O

to O
find O
a O
pretext O
for O
backing O
out O

“ O
I O
thought O
you O

” O
Thus O

next B-DATE

some O
notions O

in O
all O

opinions O
Crawley S-PERSON
agreed O
laughingly O

one O
of O

made O

added O
to O
her O
original O
regard O
for O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON

Her O
woman’s O
instinct O
had O
told O
her O
, O
that O
it O
was O
George S-PERSON
who O
had O
interrupted O
the O
success O
of O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
love O

she O
esteemed O
him O
accordingly O

“ O
I O
only O
just O
warn O
you O

he O
said O
to O
Rawdon B-PERSON

with O
a O
knowing O
look O

a O
look O

peculiar O
gratitude O

“ O
You’re O
wide O
awake O

And O
George S-PERSON
went O
off O
, O
thinking O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
quite O
right O
. O
He O
told O
Amelia S-PERSON
of O
what O
he O
had O
done O
, O

how O
he O
had O
counselled O

a O
devilish O

“ O
Against O

“ O
Your O

was O
invisible O
to O

to O

virgin O

the O
stupid O
peepers O
of O

For O

where O
these O

an O

for O
a O
little O

see O
it O
all O

Rebecca S-PERSON
kissed O
her O

regarding O

utterly O
without O

illness O

But O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
would O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
departure O

for O
though O
there O

no O
lady O

London S-GPE

would O
desert O
her O

more O
complacently O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
tired O

them O

she O
clung O

energy O

Rebecca S-PERSON

The O
news O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley’s E-PERSON
death O
provoked O
no O
more O
grief O

comment O
than O
might O
have O
been O
expected O
in O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
family O
circle O
. O
“ O
I O
suppose O
I O

put O
off O
my O
party O

the O
3rd S-ORDINAL

” O
Miss O

said O

added O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
“ O
I O

rage O

be O

” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
remarked O
, O
with O
his O
usual O
regard O
for O
his O
elder O
brother O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
nothing O
. O
She O
seemed O
by O
far O
the O
gravest O
and O
most O
impressed O
of O
the O
family O
. O
She O
left O
the O
room O
before O
Rawdon S-PERSON
went O
away O
that O
day O

but O
they O
met O
by O
chance O
below O
, O
as O
he O
was O
going O
away O
after O
taking O
leave O

had O
a O
parley O
together O

On O
the O
morrow O
, O
as O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
gazing O
from O
the O
window O
, O
she O
startled O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
placidly O
occupied O
with O
a O
French S-NORP
novel O
, O
by O
crying O
out O
in O
an O
alarmed O
tone O
, O
“ O
Here’s O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
Ma’am O
! O
” O
and O
the O
Baronet’s S-WORK_OF_ART

followed O
this O
announcement O

“ O

cried O
out O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
and O
resumed O
the O
novel O
. O
“ O
She’s O
too O
ill O

Rebecca S-PERSON

tripping O
down O
to O
Sir O

who O
was O
preparing O
to O
ascend O

“ O
So O

Sir O

his O

its O
great O

His O
eyes O
had O
such O
a O
strange O
look O
, O
and O
fixed O
upon O
her O
so O
steadfastly O
, O
that O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp E-PERSON
began O
almost O
to O
tremble O

“ O
I O

she O

how O

Miss O

with O
a O
look O

voice O
of O
great O
scorn O

“ O
They O

more O
bewildered O

Miss O

“ O

answered O
Sir O

, O
with O
a O
coolness O

good O
- O
humour O

set O
Miss O

almost O
mad O
with O
bewilderment O

That O

fall O
on O
his O

wildly O
through O
this O

— O
her O
impatience O
had O
overcome O
her O

she O
could O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
tardy O
operations O
of O
her O
ambassadress O
: O
so O
she O
came O
in O
person O
, O
and O
ordered O
Briggs S-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
And O
expressing O
her O
approval O
of O
Rebecca’s O
conduct O
, O
she O
asked O
particulars O
of O
the O
interview O
, O
and O
the O
previous O
transactions O
which O
had O
brought O
about O
the O
astonishing O
offer O
of O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
she O
had O
long O
had O
some O
notion O
of O
the O
partiality O
with O
which O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
honoured O
her O
, O
( O
for O
he O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
making O
his O
feelings O
known O
in O
a O
very O
frank O
and O
unreserved O
manner O
, O
) O
but O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
private O
reasons O
with O
which O
she O
would O
not O
for O
the O
present O
trouble O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
age O
, O
station O
, O
and O
habits O
were O
such O
as O
to O
render O
a O
marriage O
quite O
impossible O

and O
could O
a O
woman O
with O
any O
feeling O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
and O
any O
decency O
listen O
to O
proposals O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
, O
when O
the O
funeral O
of O
the O
lover’s O
deceased O
wife O
had O
not O
actually O
taken O
place O
? O
“ O
Nonsense O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
would O
never O
have O
refused O
him O

there O
not O
been O
some O
one O
else O
in O
the O
case O
, O
” O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
said O
, O
coming O
to O
her O
point O
at O
once O
. O
“ O
Tell O
me O
the O
private O
reasons O

are O
the O
private O

some O
one O

who O
is O
it O
that O
has O
touched O
your O

” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
cast O
down O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
owned O
there O
was O
. O
“ O
You O
have O
guessed O
right O
, O
dear O
lady O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
sweet O
simple O
faltering O
voice O
. O
“ O
You O
wonder O
at O
one O
so O
poor O
and O
friendless O
having O
an O
attachment O
, O
don’t O
you O
? O
I O
have O
never O
heard O
that O
poverty O

any O

it O

I O
wish O
it O
were O
. O
” O
“ O
My O
poor O
dear O
child O
, O
” O
cried O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
always O
quite O
ready O
to O
be O
sentimental O
, O
“ O
is O
our O
passion O
unrequited O
, O
then O
? O
Are O
we O
pining O
in O
secret O

Tell O
me O
all O

me O

“ O
I O
wish O
you O
could O

dear O
Madam S-PERSON
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
in O
the O
same O
tearful O
tone O
. O
“ O
Indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
need O
it O
. O
” O
And O
she O
laid O
her O
head O
upon O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
shoulder O
and O
wept O
there O
so O
naturally O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
surprised O
into O
sympathy O
, O
embraced O
her O
with O
an O
almost O
maternal O
kindness O
, O
uttered O
many O
soothing O
protests O
of O
regard O
and O
affection O
for O
her O
, O
vowed O
that O
she O
loved O
her O
as O
a O
daughter O
, O
and O
would O
do O
everything O
in O
her O
power O

serve O
her O

“ O
And O
now O
, O
who O
is O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
Is O
it O
that O
pretty O
Miss O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
brother O
? O
You O
said O
something O
about O
an O
affair O
with O
him O

I’ll O
ask O
him O
here O
, O
my O

you O
shall O
have O
him O

” O
“ O
Don’t O
ask O
me O
now O

Rebecca S-PERSON

“ O
You O
shall O
know O
all O
soon O

you O

Dear O
kind O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
— O
Dear O
friend O
, O
may O
I O
say O
so O
? O
” O
“ O
That O
you O
may O
, O
my O
child O
, O
” O
the O
old O
lady O
replied O
, O
kissing O
her O
. O
“ O
I O
can’t O
tell O
you O
now O
, O
” O
sobbed O
out O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
“ O
I O
am O
very O
miserable O
. O
But O
O O
! O
love O
me O
always O

promise O
you O
will O
love O
me O
always O

” O
And O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
mutual O
tears O
— O
for O
the O
emotions O
of O
the O
younger O
woman O
had O
awakened O
the O
sympathies O
of O
the O
elder O
— O
this O
promise O
was O
solemnly O
given O
by O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
who O
left O
her O
little O
protégée O
, O
blessing O
and O
admiring O
her O
as O
a O
dear O
, O
artless O
, O
tender O
- O
hearted O
, O
affectionate O
, O
incomprehensible O
creature O
. O
And O
now O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
to O
think O
over O
the O
sudden O
and O
wonderful O
events O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
of O
what O
had O
been O
and O
what O
might O
have O
been O
. O
What O
think O
you O
were O
the O
private O
feelings O
of O
Miss O
, O
no O
( O
begging O
her O
pardon O
) O
of O
Mrs. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
? O
If O
, O
a O
few O
pages O
back O
, O
the O
present O
writer O
claimed O
the O
privilege O
of O
peeping O
into O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley’s E-PERSON
bedroom O
, O
and O
understanding O
with O
the O
omniscience O
of O
the O
novelist O
all O
the O
gentle O
pains O
and O
passions O
which O
were O
tossing O
upon O
that O
innocent O
pillow O
, O
why O
should O
he O
not O
declare O
himself O
to O
be O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
confidante O
too O
, O
master O
of O
her O
secrets O
, O
and O
seal O
- O
keeper O
of O
that O
young O
woman’s O
conscience O
? O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
gave O
way O
to O
some O
very O
sincere O
and O
touching O
regrets O
that O
a O
piece O
of O
marvellous O
good O
fortune O
should O
have O
been O
so O
near O
her O
, O
and O
she O
actually O
obliged O
to O
decline O
it O
. O
In O
this O
natural O
emotion O
every O
properly O
regulated O
mind O
will O
certainly O
share O
. O
What O
good O
mother O
is O
there O
that O
would O
not O
commiserate O
a O
penniless O
spinster O
, O
who O
might O
have O
been O
my O
lady O
, O
and O
have O
shared O
four B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
a I-DATE
year E-DATE
? O
What O
well O
- O
bred O
young O
person O
is O
there O
in O
all O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG

who O
will O
not O
feel O
for O
a O
hard O
working O
, O
ingenious O

meritorious O
girl O
, O
who O
gets O
such O
an O
honourable O

provoking O
offer O
, O
just O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
it O
is O
out O
of O
her O
power O
to O
accept O
it O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
our O
friend O
Becky’s S-PERSON
disappointment O
deserves O
and O
will O
command O
every O
sympathy O
. O
I O
remember O
one B-TIME
night E-TIME
being O
in O
the O
Fair O
myself O
, O
at O
an O
evening O
party O
. O
I O
observed O
old O
Miss O
Today O
there O
also O
present O
, O
single O
out O
for O
her O
special O
attentions O
and O
flattery O
little O
Mrs. O
Briefless S-PERSON
, O
the O
barrister’s O
wife O
, O
who O
is O
of O
a O
good O
family O
certainly O
, O
but O
, O
as O
we O
all O
know O
, O
is O
as O
poor O
as O
poor O
can O
be O
. O
What O
, O
I O
asked O
in O
my O
own O
mind O
, O
can O
cause O
this O
obsequiousness O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Miss O
Toady S-PERSON
| | O
has O
Briefless S-PERSON
got O
a O
county O
court O
, O
or O
his O
wife O
had O
a O
fortune O
left O
her O
? O
Miss O
Toady S-PERSON
explained O
presently O
, O
with O
that O
simplicity O
which O
distinguishes O
all O
her O
conduct O
. O
“ O
You O
know O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
Mrs. O
Briefless S-PERSON
is O
granddaughter O
of O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
Redhand E-PERSON

so O
ill O

Mrs. O

so O
you O
see O
she O
will O
be O
a O
baronet’s O
daughter O
, O
” O
And O
Toady S-PERSON
asked O
Briefless S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
to O
dinner O
the B-DATE
very I-DATE
next I-DATE
week E-DATE
. O
If O
the O
mere O
chance O
of O
becoming O
a O
baronet’s O
daughter O
can O
procure O
a O
lady O
such O
homage O
in O
the O
world O
, O
surely O
, O
surely O
we O
may O
respect O
the O
agonies O
of O
a O
young O
woman O
who O
has O
lost O
the O
opportunity O
of O
becoming O
a O
baronet’s O
wife O
. O
Who O
would O
have O
dreamed O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
dying O
so O
soon O
? O
She O
was O
one O
of O
those O
sickly O
women O
that O
might O
have O
lasted O
these O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE
— O
Rebecca S-PERSON
thought O
to O
herself O
, O
in O
all O
the O
woes O
of O
repentance O
— O
and O
I O
might O
have O
been O
my O
lady O
! O
I O
might O
have O
led O
that O
old O
man O
whither O
I O
would O
. O
I O
might O
have O
thanked O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
for O
her O
patronage O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Pitt S-PERSON
for O
his O
insufferable O
condescension O

I O
would O
have O
had O
the O
town O

house O
newly O
furnished O

decorated O

I O
would O
have O
had O
the O
handsomest O
carriage O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
and O
a O
box O
at O
the O
opera O

and O
I O
would O
have O
been O
presented O
next B-DATE
season E-DATE
. O
All O
this O
might O
have O
been O
, O
and O
now O
— O
now O
all O
was O
doubt O
and O
mystery O
. O
But O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
too O
much O
resolution O
and O
energy O
of O
character O
to O
permit O
herself O
much O
useless O
and O
unseemly O
sorrow O
for O
the O
irrevocable O
past O
| | O
so O
, O
having O
devoted O
only O
the O
proper O
portion O
of O
regret O
to O
it O
, O
she O
wisely O
turned O
her O
whole O
attention O
towards O
the O
future O
, O
which O
was O
now O
vastly O
more O
important O
to O
her O
. O
And O
she O
surveyed O
her O
position O
, O
and O
its O
hopes O
, O
doubts O
, O
and O
chances O
. O
In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
, O
she O
was O
married O

— O
that O
was O
a O
great O
fact O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
knew O
it O
. O
She O
was O
not O
so O
much O
surprised O
into O
the O
avowal O
, O
as O
induced O
to O
make O
it O
by O
a O
sudden O
calculation O
. O
It O
must O
have O
come O
some O
day O
: O
and O
why O
not O
now O
as O
at O
a O
later O
period O
? O
He O
who O
would O
have O
married O
her O
himself O
must O
at O
least O
be O
silent O
with O
regard O
to O
her O
marriage O
. O
How O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
would O
bear O
the O
news O
— O
was O
the O
great O
question O
. O
Misgivings O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
| | O
but O
she O
remembered O
all O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
said O

the O
old O
lady’s O
avowed O
contempt O
for O
birth O
| | O
her O
daring O
liberal O
opinions O

her O
general O
romantic O
propensities O

her O
almost O
doting O
attachment O
to O
her O
nephew O
, O
and O
her O
repeatedly O
- O
expressed O
fondness O
for O
Rebecca S-PERSON
herself O
. O
She O
is O
so O
fond O
of O
him O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
thought O
, O
that O
she O
will O
forgive O
him O
anythin O
she O
is O
so O
used O
to O
me O
that O
I O
don’t O
think O
she O
could O
be O
comfortable O
without O
me O
: O
when O
the O
éclaircissement O
comes O
there O
will O
be O
a O
scene O
, O
and O
hysterics O
, O
and O
a O
great O
quarrel O
, O
and O
then O
a O
great O
reconciliation O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
what O
use O
was O
there O
in O
delaying O
? O
the O
die O
was O
thrown O
, O
and O
now O
or O
to O
- O
morrow O
the O
issue O
must O
be O
the O
same O
. O
And O
so O
, O
resolved O
that O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
should O
have O
the O
news O
, O
the O
young O
person O
debated O
in O
her O
mind O
as O
to O
the O
best O
means O
of O
conveying O
it O
to O
her O
| | O
and O
whether O
she O
should O
face O
the O
storm O
that O
must O
come O
, O
or O

— O
The O
great O
crisis O

we O

debated O
about O
so O
often O

come O
. O
Half S-CARDINAL
of O
my O
secret O

known O

and O
I O
have O
thought O
and O
thought O
, O
until O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
that O
now O
is O
the O
time O
to O
reveal O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
mystery O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
came O
to O
me O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
and O
made O
— O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O
— O
a O
declaration O
in O
form O
. O
Think O
of O
that O
! O
Poor O
little O
me O
. O
I O
might O
have O
been O
Lady B-PERSON

How O
pleased O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
and O
ma O
tante O
if O
I O
had O
taken O
precedence O
of O
her O
. O
I O
might O
have O
been O
somebody’s O
mamma O
, O
instead O
of O
— O
O O
, O
I O
tremble O
, O
I O
tremble O
, O
when O
I O
think O
how O
soon O
we O
must O
tell O
all O
! O
— O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
knows O
I O
am O
married O
, O
and O
not O
knowing O
to O
whom O
, O
is O
not O
very O
much O
displeased O
as O
yet O
. O
Ma S-PERSON
tante O
is O
actually O
angry O
that O
I O
should O
have O
refused O
him O
. O
But O
she O
is O
all O
kindness O
and O
graciousness O
. O
She O
condescends O
to O
say O
I O
would O
have O
made O
him O
a O
good O
wife O

and O
vows O
that O
she O
will O
be O
a O
mother O

your O
little O
Rebecca S-PERSON

She O
will O
be O
shaken O
when O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
hears O
the O
news O
. O
But O
need O
we O
fear O
anything O
beyond O
a O
momentary O
anger O
? O
I O
think O
not O
: O
I O
am O
sure O
not O
. O
She O
dotes O
upon O
you O
so O
( O
you O
naughty O

good O
- O
for O

nothing O

, O
that O
she O
would O
pardon O
you O
anythin O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
the O
next O
place O
in O
her O
heart O
is O
mine O

and O
that O
she O
would O
be O
miserable O

me O

Dearest O

who O
, O
after O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour’s O
interval O
, O
escorted O
her O
back O
to O
the O
hackney O

coach O
in O
waiting O

that O
this O
was O
a O
quiet O
bridal O

And O
who O
on O
earth O
, O
after O
the O
daily O
experience O
we O
have O
, O
can O
question O
the O
probability O
of O
a O

How O
many O
of O

Did O
not O
Lord O

himself O

the O
most O
prudent O

make O

Achilles S-PERSON

Ajax S-PERSON
both O
in O

are O

to O
expect O
a O
heavy O

strong O
desires O

small O
brains O
, O
who O
had O
never O
controlled O
a O
passion O
in O
his O
life O

to O
become O
prudent O
all O
of O
a O

to O
refuse O

pay O
any O

seems O
to O
me O
, O
for O
my O
part O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
marriage O
was O
one O

the O
honestest O
actions O

, O
by O

this O

little O
Rebecca S-PERSON

were O
feelings O

the O

at O

will O
pronounce O
were O
not O
altogether O
discreditable O
to O
him O

When O
she O
sang O
, O
every O
note O
thrilled O
in O
his O
dull O
soul O
, O
and O
tingled O
through O
his O
huge O
frame O
. O
When O
she O
spoke O
, O
he O
brought O
all O
the O
force O
of O
his O
brains O
to O
listen O
and O
wonder O
. O
If O
she O
was O
jocular O
, O
he O
used O
to O
revolve O
her O
jokes O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
and O
explode O
over O
them O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
afterwards O
in O
the O

to O
the O

the O
comrade O
riding O
with O
him O
in O
Rotten B-WORK_OF_ART
Row E-WORK_OF_ART

Her O
words O
were O
oracles O

him O
, O
her O
smallest O
actions O
marked O
by O
an O
infallible O
grace O

wisdom O

“ O
How O

rode O
that O
kicking O
mare O
at O
Queen’s B-FAC
Crawley E-FAC

” O
And O
he O
would O
say O
to O
her O
in O
confidential O
moments O
, O
“ O

Becky S-PERSON
told O
him O
that O

was O
near O

the O
time O
for O
action O

Rawdon S-PERSON
expressed O
himself O
as O
ready O

act O

be O

was O

him O

put O
his O
letter O
into O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
volume O

Porteus S-PERSON

a O

communicated O
to O
Rawdon S-PERSON
the O
result O

And O
wherefore O
? O
I O
inquired O
of O
my O
own O
soul O
: O
she O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
married O
. O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
Briggs S-PERSON
in O
a O
word O
, O
after O
the O
affair O
of O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
indulged O
in O
the O
utmost O
luxury O
of O
sentiment O
, O
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
became O
an O
object O
of O
the O
most O
tender O
interest O
to O
them O
. O
In O
her O
absence O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
solaced O
herself O
with O
the O
most O
sentimental O
of O
the O
novels O
in O
her O
library O
. O
Little O
Sharp S-PERSON
, O
with O
her O
secret O
griefs O
, O
was O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
day O
. O
That O
night O
Rebecca S-PERSON
sang O
more O
sweetly O
and O
talked O
more O
pleasantly O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
heard O
to O
do O
in O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
. O
She O
twined O
herself O
round O
the O
heart O
of O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
. O
She O
spoke O
lightly O
and O
laughingly O
of O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
proposal O
, O
ridiculed O
it O
as O
the O
foolish O
fancy O
of O
an O
old O
man O

and O
her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
Briggs’s S-PERSON
heart O
with O
unutterable O
pangs O
of O
defeat O
, O
as O
she O
said O
she O
desired O
no O
other O
lot O
than O
to O
remain O
for O
ever O
with O
her O
dear O
benefactress O
. O
“ O
My O
dear O
little O
creature O
, O
” O
the O
old O
lady O
said O
, O
“ O

that O
odious O
brother O

what O
has O
passed O

it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O

Here O
you O
stay O
with O
me O
and O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
Briggs S-PERSON
wants O
to O
go O
to O
see O
her O
relations O
very O
often O
. O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
go O
when O
you O
like O
. O
But O
as O
for O
you O
, O
my O
dear O

you O
must O
stay O
and O
take O
care O
of O
the O
old O
woman O
. O
” O
If O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
had O
been O
then O
and O
there O
present O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
at O
the O
club O
nervously O
drinking O
claret O
, O
the O
pair O
might O
have O
gone O
down O
on O
their O
knees O
before O
the O
old O
spinster O
, O
avowed O
all O
, O
and O
been O
forgiven O
in O
a O
twinkling O
. O
But O
that O
good O
chance O
was O
denied O
to O
the O
young O
couple O
, O
doubtless O
in O
order O
that O
this O
story O
might O
be O
written O
, O
in O
which O
numbers O
of O
their O
wonderful O
adventures O
are O
narrated O
— O
adventures O
which O
could O
never O

occurred O
to O
them O

they O
had O
been O
housed O

sheltered O
under O
the O
comfortable O
uninteresting O
forgiveness O
of O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON

Under O
Mrs. O
Firkin’s S-PERSON
orders O
, O
in O
the O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
establishment O
, O
was O
a O
young O
woman O
from O
Hampshire S-GPE
, O
whose O
business O
it O
was O
, O
among O

Miss B-FAC

which O
Firkin S-ORG
would O
rather O
have O
perished O
than O
have O
presented O

the O
intruder O
. O
This O
girl O
, O
bred O
on O
the O
family O
estate O
, O
had O
a O
brother O
in O
Captain O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
troop O
, O
and O
if O
the O
truth O
were O
known O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
it O
would O
come O
out O
that O

three S-CARDINAL
guineas O

Rebecca S-PERSON
gave O
her O

as O
little O
Sharp S-PERSON
was O
by O
no O

too O
liberal O
with O
her O
money O

no O
doubt O
it O
was O

Betty B-PERSON
Martin E-PERSON

the O

at O
the O

No O

Silence O

still O

Betty S-PERSON

with O
the O

opened O
the O

entered O
the O

The O
little O
white O
dimity O

was O
as O
smooth O
and O
trim O
as O
on O
the O
day O
previous O

when O
Betty’s S-PERSON
own O
hands O
had O

the O

lay O
a O

had O
been O
reposing O

probably O
all O
night O

Betty S-PERSON
advanced O
towards O
it O
on O
tiptoe O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
afraid O
to O
awake O
it O
— O
looked O
at O
it O

and O
round O
the O
room O

with O
an O
air O
of O
great O
wonder O

satisfaction O

took O
up O
the O
letter O

grinned O
intensely O
as O
she O
turned O
it O
round O

over O
, O
and O
finally O
carried O
it O
into O
Miss O

How O
could O
Betty S-PERSON
tell O
that O
the O
letter O
was O
for O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
I O
should O
like O

at O
Mrs. O

much O

good O
an O
opinion O

not O

out O

out O
of O

could O
be O
serviceable O

no O
possible O
manner O

Rebecca S-PERSON

entirely O
surprised O

the O
sight O

had O
met O
with O
no O
small O
kindness O

ransacked O

its O
quiet O

up O

the O
readiness O
with O
which O
the O
closest O
of O
friends O
and O
honestest O
of O
men O
suspect O
and O
accuse O
each O
other O
of O
cheating O
when O
they O
fall O
not O
on O
money O
matters O
? O
Everybody O
does O
it O
. O
Everybody O
is O
right O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
and O
the O
world O
is O
a O
rogue O
. O
Then O
Osborne S-PERSON
had O
the O
intolerable O
sense O
of O
former O
benefits O
to O
goad O
and O
irritate O
him O
: O
these O
are O
always O
a O
cause O
of O
hostility O
aggravated O
. O
Finally O
, O
he O
had O
to O
break O
off O
the O
match O
between O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
daughter O
and O
his O
son O
| | O
and O
as O
it O
had O
gone O
very O
far O
indeed O
, O
and O
as O
the O
poor O
girl’s O
happiness O
and O
perhaps O
character O
were O
compromised O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
show O
the O
strongest O
reasons O
for O
the O
rupture O
, O
and O
for O
John B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
to O
prove O
John B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
to O
be O
a O
very O
bad O
character O
indeed O
. O
At O
the O
meetings O
of O
creditors O
, O
then O
, O
he O
comported O
himself O
with O
a O
savageness O
and O
scorn O
towards O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
which O
almost O
succeeded O
in O
breaking O
the O
heart O
of O
that O
ruined O
bankrupt O
man O
. O
On O
George’s O
intercourse O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
he O
put O
an O
instant O
veto O
— O
menacing O
the O
youth O
with O
maledictions O
if O
he O
broke O
his O
commands O
, O
and O
vilipending O
the O
poor O
innocent O
girl O
as O
the O
basest O
and O
most O
artful O
of O
vixens O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
great O
conditions O
of O
anger O
and O
hatred O
is O
, O
that O
you O
must O
tell O
and O
believe O
lies O
against O
the O
hated O
object O
, O
in O
order O
, O
as O
we O
said O
, O
to O
be O
consistent O
. O
When O
the O
great O
crash O
came O
— O
the O
announcement O
of O
ruin O
, O
and O
the O
departure O
from O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
and O
the O
declaration O
that O
all O
was O
over O
between O
her O
and O
George S-PERSON
— O
all O
over O
between O
her O
and O
love O
, O
her O
and O
happiness O
, O
her O
and O
faith O
in O
the O
world O
— O
a O
brutal O
letter O
from O
John B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
told O
her O
in O
a O
few O
curt O
lines O
that O
her O
father’s O
conduct O
had O
been O
of O
such O
a O
nature O
that O
all O
engagements O
between O
the O
families O
were O
at O
an O
end O
— O
when O
the O
final O
award O
came O
, O
it O
did O
not O
shock O
her O
so O
much O
as O
her O
parents O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
rather O
expected O
( O
for O
John B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
himself O
was O
entirely O
prostrate O
in O
the O
ruins O
of O
his O
own O
affairs O
and O
shattered O
honour O
) O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
took O
the O
news O
very O
palely O
and O
calmly O
. O
It O
was O
only O
the O
confirmation O
of O
the O
dark O
presages O
which O
had O
long O
gone O
before O
. O
It O
was O
the O
mere O
reading O
of O
the O
sentence O
— O
of O
the O
crime O
she O
had O
long O
ago O
been O
guilty O
— O
the O
crime O
of O
loving O
wrongly O
, O
too O
violently O
, O
against O
reason O
. O
She O
told O
no O
more O
of O
her O
thoughts O
now O
than O
she O
had O
before O
. O
She O
seemed O
scarcely O
more O
unhappy O
now O
when O
convinced O
all O
hope O
was O
over O
, O
than O
before O
when O
she O
felt O
but O
dared O
not O
confess O
that O
it O
was O
gone O
. O
So O
she O
changed O
from O
the O
large O
house O
to O
the O
small O
one O
without O
any O
mark O
or O
difference O
| | O
remained O
in O
her O
little O
room O
for O
the O
most O
part O
| | O
pined O
silently O
| | O
and O
died O
away O
day O
by O
day O
. O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
all O
females O
are O
so O
. O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Bullock S-PERSON
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
your O
heart O
would O
break O
in O
this O
way O
. O
You O
are O
a O
strong O
- O
minded O
young O
woman O
with O
proper O
principles O
. O
I O
do O
not O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
mine O
would O
| | O
it O
has O
suffered O
, O
and O
, O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
, O
survived O
. O
But O
there O
are O
some O
souls O
thus O
gently O
constituted O
, O
thus O
frail O
, O
and O
delicate O
, O
and O
tender O
. O
Whenever O
old O
John B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
thought O
of O
the O
affair O
between O
George S-PERSON
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
or O
alluded O
to O
it O
, O
it O
was O
with O
bitterness O
almost O
as O
great O
as O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
himself O
had O
shown O
. O
He O
cursed O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
his O
family O
as O
heartless O
, O
wicked O
, O
and O
ungrateful O
. O
No O
power O
on O
earth O
, O
he O
swore O
, O
would O
induce O
him O
to O
marry O
his O
daughter O
to O
the O
son O
of O
such O
a O
villain O
, O
and O
he O
ordered O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
to O
banish O
George S-PERSON
from O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
to O
return O
all O
the O
presents O
and O
letters O
which O
she O
had O
ever O
had O
from O
him O
. O
She O
promised O
acquiescence O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
obey O
. O
She O
put O
up O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
or O
three S-CARDINAL
trinkets O
: O
and O
, O
as O
for O
the O
letters O
, O
she O
drew O
them O
out O
of O
the O
place O
where O
she O
kept O
them O
| | O
and O
read O
them O
over O
— O
as O
if O
she O
did O
not O
know O
them O
by O
heart O
already O
| | O
but O
she O
could O
not O
part O
with O
them O
. O
That O
effort O
was O
too O
much O
for O
her O
| | O
she O
placed O
them O
back O
in O
her O
bosom O
again O
— O
as O
you O
have O
seen O
a O
woman O
nurse O
a O
child O
that O
is O
dead O
. O
Young O
Amelia S-PERSON
felt O
that O
she O
would O
die O
or O
lose O
her O
senses O
outright O
, O
if O
torn O
away O
from O
this O
last O
consolation O
. O
How O
she O
used O
to O
blush O
and O
lighten O
up O
when O
those O
letters O
came O
! O
How O
she O
used O
to O
trip O
away O
with O
a O
beating O
heart O
, O
so O
that O
she O
might O
read O
unseen O
! O
If O
they O
were O
cold O
, O
yet O
how O
perversely O
this O
fond O
little O
soul O
interpreted O
them O
into O
warmth O
. O
If O
they O
were O
short O
or O
selfish O
, O
what O
excuses O
she O
found O
for O
the O
writer O
! O
It O
was O
over O
these O
few O
worthless O
papers O
that O
she O
brooded O
and O
brooded O
. O
She O
lived O
in O
her O
past O
life O
— O
every O
letter O
seemed O
to O
recall O
some O
circumstance O
of O
it O
. O
How O
well O
she O
remembered O
them O
all O
! O
His O
looks O
and O
tones O
, O
his O
dress O
, O
what O
he O
said O
and O
how O
— O
these O
relics O
and O
remembrances O
of O
dead O
affection O
were O
all O
that O
were O
left O
her O
in O
the O
world O
. O
And O
the O
business O
of O
her O
life O
, O
was O
— O
to O
watch O
the O
corpse O
of O
Love S-WORK_OF_ART
. O
To O
death O
she O
looked O
with O
inexpressible O
longing O
. O
Then O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
I O
shall O
always O
be O
able O
to O
follow O
him O
. O
I O
am O
not O
praising O
her O
conduct O
or O
setting O
her O
up O
as O
a O
model O
for O
Miss O
Bullock S-PERSON
to O
imitate O
. O
Miss O
B. S-PERSON
knows O
how O
to O
regulate O
her O
feelings O
better O
than O
this O
poor O
little O
creature O

Miss O
B. S-PERSON
would O
never O
have O
committed O
herself O
as O
that O
imprudent O
Amelia S-PERSON
had O
done O

pledged O
her O
love O
irretrievably O

confessed O
her O
heart O
away O
, O
and O
got O
back O
nothing O
— O
only O
a O
brittle O
promise O
which O
was O
snapt O
and O
worthless O
in O
a O
moment O

long O
engagement O

too O
. O
yesterday S-DATE
, O
before O
he O
came O
down O
to O
Chatham S-GPE
| | O
and O
, O
what O
is O
more O
, O
he O
had O
brought O
that O
farewell O
letter O
and O
packet O
which O
had O
so O
moved O
them O
. O
The O
good O
- O
natured O
fellow O
had O
found O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
only O
too O
willing O
to O
receive O
him O
, O
and O
greatly O
agitated O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
piano O
, O
which O
, O
as O
she O
conjectured O
, O
must O
have O
come O
from O
George S-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
a O
signal O
of O
amity O
on O
his O
part O
. O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
did O
not O
correct O
this O
error O
of O
the O
worthy O
lady O
, O
but O
listened O
to O
all O
her O
story O
of O
complaints O
and O
misfortunes O
with O
great O
sympathy O
— O
condoled O
with O
her O
losses O
and O
privations O
, O
and O
agreed O
in O
reprehending O
the O
cruel O
conduct O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
towards O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
benefactor O
. O
When O
she O
had O
eased O
her O
overflowing O
bosom O
somewhat O
, O
and O
poured O
forth O
many O
of O
her O
sorrows O
, O
he O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
ask O
actually O
to O
see O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
above O
in O
her O
room O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
whom O
her O
mother O
led O
trembling O
downstairs O
. O
Her O
appearance O
was O
so O
ghastly O
, O
and O
her O
look O
of O
despair O
so O
pathetic O
, O
that O
honest O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
was O
frightened O
as O
he O
beheld O
it O
| | O
and O
read O
the O
most O
fatal O
forebodings O
in O
that O
pale O
fixed O
face O
. O
After O
sitting O
in O
his O
company O
a O
minute O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
she O
put O
the O
packet O
into O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
Take O
this O
to O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
and O
— O
and O
I O
hope O
he’s O
quite O
well O
— O
and O
it O
was O
very O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
come O
and O
see O
us O
— O
and O
we O
like O
our O
new O
house O
very O
much O
. O
And O
I O
— O
I O
think O
I’ll O
go O
upstairs O
, O
Mamma O
, O
for O
I’m O
not O
very O
strong O
. O
” O
And O
with O
this O
, O
and O
a O
curtsey O
and O
a O
smile O
, O
the O
poor O
child O
went O
her O
way O
. O
The O
mother O
, O
as O
she O
led O
her O
up O
, O
cast O
back O
looks O
of O
anguish O
towards O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
The O
good O
fellow O
wanted O
no O
such O
appeal O
. O
He O
loved O
her O
himself O
too O
fondly O
for O
that O
. O
Inexpressible O
grief O
, O
and O
pity O
, O
and O
terror O
pursued O
him O
, O
and O
he O
came O
away O
as O
if O
he O
was O
a O
criminal O
after O
seeing O
her O
. O
When O
Osborne S-PERSON
heard O
that O
his O
friend O
had O
found O
her O
, O
he O
made O
hot O
and O
anxious O
inquiries O
regarding O
the O
poor O
child O
. O
How O
was O
she O
? O
How O
did O
she O
look O
? O
What O
did O
she O
say O
? O
His O
comrade O
took O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
looked O
him O
in O
the O
face O
. O
“ O
George S-PERSON
, O
she’s O
dying O
, O
” O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
said O
, O
— O
and O
could O
speak O
no O
more O
. O
There O
was O
a O
buxom O
Irish S-NORP
servant O
- O
girl O
, O
who O
performed O
all O
the O
duties O
of O
the O
little O
house O
where O
the O
Sedley S-PERSON
family O
had O
found O
refuge O
: O
and O
this O
girl O
had O
in O
vain O
, O
on O
many B-DATE
previous I-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
striven O
to O
give O
Amelia S-PERSON
aid O
or O
consolation O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
was O
much O
too O
sad O
to O
answer O
, O
or O
even O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
attempts O
the O
other O
was O
making O
in O
her O
favour O
. O
Four B-TIME
hours E-TIME
after O
the O
talk O
between O
Dobbin S-PERSON
and O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
this O
servant O
maid O
came O
into O
Amelia’s O
room O
, O
where O
she O
sat O
as O
usual O
, O
brooding O
silently O
over O
her O
letters O
— O
her O
little O
treasures O
. O
The O
girl O
, O
smiling O
, O
and O
looking O
arch O
and O
happy O
, O
made O
many O
trials O
to O
attract O
poor O
Emmy’s S-NORP
attention O
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
took O
no O
heed O
of O
her O
. O
“ O
Miss B-WORK_OF_ART
Emmy E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
” O
said O
the O
girl O
. O
“ O
I’m O
coming O
, O
” O
Emmy S-PERSON
said O
, O
not O
looking O
round O
. O
“ O
There’s O
a O
message O
, O
” O
the O
maid O
went O
on O
. O
“ O
There’s O
something O
— O
somebody O
— O
sure O
, O
here’s O
a O
new O
letter O
for O
you O
— O
don’t O
be O
reading O
them O
old O
ones O
any O
more O
. O
” O
And O
she O
gave O
her O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
Emmy S-PERSON
took O
, O
and O
read O
. O
“ O
I O
must O
see O
you O
, O
” O
the O
letter O
said O

“ O
Dearest O
Emmy S-PERSON
— O
dearest O

dearest O
wife O

come O
to O
me O

” O
George S-PERSON
and O
her O
mother O
were O
outside O
, O
waiting O
until O
she O
had O
read O
the O
letter O

XIX O
. O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
at O
Nurse O
WE O
have O
seen O
how O
Mrs. O
Firkin S-PERSON
, O
the O
lady’s O
maid O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
any O
event O
of O
importance O
to O
the O
Crawley S-PERSON
family O
came O
to O
her O
knowledge O
, O
felt O
bound O
to O
communicate O
it O
to O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
| | O
and O
have O
before O
mentioned O
how O
particularly O
kind O
and O
attentive O
that O
good O
- O
natured O
lady O
was O
to O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
confidential O
servant O
. O
She O
had O
been O
a O
gracious O
friend O
to O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
the O
companion O
, O
also O
| | O
and O
had O
secured O
the O
latter’s O
good O
- O
will O
by O
a O
number O
of O
those O
attentions O
and O
promises O
, O
which O
cost O
so O
little O
in O
the O
making O
, O
and O
are O
yet O
so O
valuable O
and O
agreeable O
to O
the O
recipient O
. O
Indeed O
every O
good O
economist O
and O
manager O
of O
a O
household O
must O
know O
how O
cheap O
and O
yet O
how O
amiable O
these O
professions O
are O
, O
and O
what O
a O
flavour O
they O
give O
to O
the O
most O
homely O
dish O
in O
life O
. O
Who O
was O
the O
blundering O
idiot O
who O
said O
that O
“ O
fine O
words O
butter O
no O
parsnips O
” O
? O
Half S-CARDINAL
the O
parsnips O
of O
society O
are O
served O
and O
rendered O
palatable O
with O
no O
other O
sauce O
. O
As O
the O
immortal O
Alexis B-PERSON
Soyer E-PERSON
can O
make O
more O
delicious O
soup O
for O
a O
halfpenny O
than O
an O
ignorant O
cook O
can O
concoct O
with O
pounds O
of O
vegetables O
and O
meat O
, O
so O
a O
skilful O
artist O
will O
make O
a O
few O
simple O
and O
pleasing O
phrases O
go O
farther O
than O
ever O
so O
much O
substantial O
benefit O
- O
stock O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
mere O
bungler O
. O
Nay O
, O
we O
know O
that O
substantial O
benefits O
often O
sicken O
some O
stomachs O
| | O
whereas O
, O
most O
will O
digest O
any O
amount O
of O
fine O
words O
, O
and O
be O
always O
eager O
for O
more O
of O
the O
same O
food O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
had O
told O
Briggs S-PERSON
and O
Firkin S-PERSON
so O
often O
of O
the O
depth O
of O
her O
affection O
for O
them O

and O
what O
she O
would O
do O
, O
if O
she O
had O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
fortune O
, O
for O
friends O
so O
excellent O
and O
attached O
, O
that O
the O
ladies O
in O
question O
had O
the O
deepest O
regard O
for O
her O
| | O
and O
felt O
as O
much O
gratitude O
and O
confidence O
as O
if O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
had O
loaded O
them O
with O
the O
most O
expensive O
favours O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
like O
a O
selfish O
heavy O
dragoon O
as O
he O
was O
, O
never O
took O
the O
least O
trouble O
to O
conciliate O
his O
aunt’s O
aides O
- O
de O
- O
camp O
, O
showed O
his O
contempt O
for O
the O
pair O
with O
entire O
frankness O
— O
made O
Firkin S-PERSON
pull O
off O
his O
boots O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
occasion O
— O
sent O
her O
out O
in O
the O
rain O
on O
ignominious O
messages O
— O
and O
if O
he O
gave O
her O
a O
guinea O
, O
flung O
it O
to O
her O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
box O
on O
the O
ear O
. O
As O
his O
Aunt O
, O
too O
, O
made O
a O
butt O
of O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
the O
Captain O
followed O
the O
example O
, O
and O
levelled O
his O
jokes O
at O
her O
— O
jokes O
about O
as O
delicate O
as O
a O
kick O
from O
his O
charger O
. O
Whereas O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
consulted O
her O
in O
matters O
of O
taste O
or O
difficulty O
, O
admired O
her O
poetry O
, O
and O
by O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
acts O
of O
kindness O
and O
politeness O
, O
showed O
her O
appreciation O
of O
Briggs S-PERSON
| | O
and O
if O
she O
made O
Firkin S-PERSON
a O
twopenny O
- O
halfpenny O
present O
, O
accompanied O
it O
with O
so O
many O
compliments O
, O
that O
the O
twopence O
- O
halfpenny O
was O
transmuted O
into O
gold O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
grateful O
waiting O
- O
maid O
, O
who O
, O
besides O
, O
was O
looking O
forwards O
quite O
contentedly O
to O
some O
prodigious O
benefit O
which O
must O
happen O
to O
her O
on O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
when O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
came O
into O
her O
fortune O
. O
The O
different O
conduct O
of O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
people O
is O
pointed O
out O
respectfully O
to O
the O
attention O
of O
persons O
commencing O
the O
world O
. O
Praise O
everybody O
, O
I O
say O
to O
such O
: O
never O
be O
squeamish O
, O
but O
speak O
out O
your O
compliment O
both O
point O
blank O
in O
a O
man’s O
face O
, O
and O
behind O
his O
back O
, O
when O
you O
know O
there O
is O
a O
reasonable O
chance O
of O
his O
hearing O
it O
again O
. O
Never O
lose O
a O
chance O
of O
saying O
a O
kind O
word O
. O
As O
Collingwood S-PERSON
never O
saw O
a O
vacant O
place O
in O
his O
estate O
but O
he O
took O
an O
acorn O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
and O
popped O
it O
in O
| | O
so O
deal O
with O
your O
compliments O
through O
life O
. O
An O
acorn O
costs O
nothing O
| | O
but O
it O
may O
sprout O
into O
a O
prodigious O
bit O
of O
timber O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
during O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley’s E-PERSON
prosperity O
, O
he O
was O
only O
obeyed O
with O
sulky O
acquiescence O

when O
his O
disgrace O
came O
, O
there O
was O
nobody O
to O
help O
or O
pity O
him O
. O
Whereas O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
took O
the O
command O
at O
Miss B-FAC
Crawley’s I-FAC
house E-FAC

the O

promotion O
from O
her O

her O

That O

Mrs. O

She O
knew O
Rebecca S-PERSON

spirited O

desperate O
a O
woman O
to O
submit O
without O

felt O
that O

prepare O

be O
incessantly O
watchful O
against O

out O

a O
secret O

The O
old O

liked O
Rawdon S-PERSON

who O
amused O

the O

owned O
to O

“ O
She O
always O
used O

go O

sleep O
when O
Martha S-PERSON

Louisa S-PERSON
played O
their O
duets O

poor O
dear O
Bute’s S-PERSON
talk O
about O
his O
dogs O

always O
annoyed O
her O

If O
I O
took O
her O
to O
the O
Rectory O
, O
she O
would O
grow O
angry O
with O
us O
all O
, O
and O
fly O
, O
I O
know O
she O
would O

and O
might O
fall O
into O
that O
horrid O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
clutches O
again O
, O
and O
be O
the O
victim O
of O
that O
little O
viper O
of O
a O
Sharp S-PERSON

Meanwhile O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
she O
is O
exceedingly O
unwell O
, O
and O
cannot O
move O
for O
some B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
at O
any O
rate O

during O
which O
we O
must O
think O
of O
some O
plan O

protect O
her O
from O
the O
arts O
of O
those O
unprincipled O
people O

” O
In O
the O
very O
best O
of O
moments O
, O
if O
anybody O
told O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
that O
she O
was O
, O

looked O
ill O
, O
the O
trembling O
old O
lady O
sent O
off O
for O
her O
doctor O

and O
I O
daresay O
she O
was O
very O
unwell O
after O
the O
sudden O
family O
event O
, O
which O
might O
serve O
to O
shake O
stronger O
nerves O

hers O

At O
least O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O
her O
duty O
to O
inform O
the O
physician O

the O
apothecary O

and O
the O
dame O

de- O
compagnie O
, O
and O
the O
domestics O
, O
that O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
in O
a O
most O
critical O
state O
, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
to O
act O
accordingly O
. O
She O
had O
the O
street O
laid O
knee O
- O
deep O
with O
straw O

and O
the O
knocker O
put O
by O
with O
Mr. O
Bowls’s S-PERSON
plate O
. O
She O
insisted O
that O
the O
Doctor O
should O
call O
twice O
a O
day O

and O
deluged O
her O
patient O

draughts O
every B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
When O
anybody O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
she O
uttered O
a O
shshshsh O
so O
sibilant O
and O
ominous O
, O
that O
it O
frightened O
the O
poor O
old O
lady O
in O
her O
bed O
, O
from O
which O
she O
could O
not O
look O
without O
seeing O
Mrs. O

beady O
eyes O
eagerly O
fixed O
on O
her O

as O
the O

sate O
steadfast O
in O
the O
arm O

chair O
by O
the O
bedside O

They O
seemed O
to O
lighten O
in O
the O
dark O
( O
for O
she O
kept O
the O
curtains O
closed O

as O
she O
moved O
about O
the O

on O
velvet O

There O
Miss O

the O

lost O
man O

and O
the O
moral O
to O
be O
inferred O
from O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
tale O
was O
, O
that O
the O
knavery O
of O
the O
pair O
was O
irremediable O
, O
and O
that O
no O
properly O
- O
conducted O
person O
should O
ever O
notice O
them O
again O
. O
These O
were O
the O
materials O
which O
prudent O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
gathered O
together O
in O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
, O
the O
provisions O

ammunition O
as O
it O
were O
with O
which O
she O
fortified O
the O
house O
against O
the O
siege O

she O
knew O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON

his O
wife O
would O
lay O
to O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
. O
But O
if O
a O
fault O
may O
be O
found O
with O
her O
arrangements O
, O
it O
is O
this O
, O
that O
she O
was O
too O
eager O
: O
she O
managed O
rather O
too O
well O
| | O
undoubtedly O
she O
made O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
more O
ill O
than O
was O
necessary O
| | O
and O
though O
the O
old O
invalid O
succumbed O
to O
her O
authority O
, O
it O
was O
so O
harassing O
and O
severe O
, O
that O
the O
victim O
would O
be O
inclined O
to O
escape O
at O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
chance O
which O
fell O
in O
her O
way O

much O
better O

any O

sometimes O

possibility O
of O

upon O
other O
extreme O
consequences O

, O
Mrs. O

, O
with O
the O
best O

no O

for O
the O

of O

carried O
her O
conviction O
of O
the O
old O
lady’s O
illness O
so O
far O
that O
she O
almost O
managed O
her O
into O
her O
coffin O
. O
She O
pointed O
out O
her O

the O
constant O

she O

” O
Mr. O
Clump S-PERSON
now O
said O
bluntly O
, O
“ O
I O
won’t O
answer O
for O
her O
life O
if O
she O
remains O
locked O
up O

that O
dark O
room O

She O
is O
so O
nervous O
that O
we O
may O
lose O
her O
any O
day O

and O
if O
you O
wish O
Captain O
Crawley S-PERSON

be O
her O
heir O

I O
warn O
you O
frankly O

your O
very O

” O
“ O
Gracious O
mercy O
! O
is O
her O
life O
in O
danger O
? O
” O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
cried O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
why O
, O
Mr. O
Clump S-PERSON
, O
did O
you O
not O
inform O
me O
sooner O
? O
” O
The O
night O
before O
, O
Mr. O
Clump S-PERSON
and O
Dr. O
Squills S-PERSON
had O
had O
a O
consultation O
( O
over O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
at O
the O
house O
of O
Sir O
Lapin B-PERSON

, O
whose O
lady O
was O
about O

present O
him O
with O
a O
thirteenth S-ORDINAL
blessing O
) O
, O
regarding O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
her O
case O
. O
“ O
What O

little O
harpy O
that O

Squills S-PERSON

“ O

“ O

Squills S-PERSON

“ O

is O
something O
about O

” O
“ O
A O

the O
apothecary O

“ O
Of O

the O
old O

will O
fling O
him O

” O
said O
the O
physician O
, O
and O
after O
a O
pause O
added O
, O
“ O
She’ll S-PERSON

” O
“ O
Cut O

says O
Clump O
with O
a O
grin O
: O
“ O
I O

“ O

Dr. O

“ O

two B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
a O
year O
. O
” O
And O
it O
was O
acting O
upon O
this O
hint O
that O
the O
worthy O
apothecary O
spoke O
with O
so O
much O
candour O
to O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
. O
Having O
the O
old O
lady O
under O
her O
hand O
: O
in O
bed O
: O
with O
nobody O
near O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
had O
made O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
assault O
upon O
her O
, O
to O
induce O
her O
to O
alter O
her O
will O
. O
But O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
usual O
terrors O
regarding O
death O
increased O
greatly O
when O
such O
dismal O
propositions O
were O
made O
to O
her O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
saw O
that O
she O
must O
get O
her O
patient O
into O
cheerful O
spirits O
and O
health O
before O
she O
could O
hope O
to O
attain O
the O
pious O
object O
which O
she O
had O
in O
view O
. O
Whither O
to O
take O
her O
was O
the O
next O
puzzle O
. O
The O
only O
place O
where O
she O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
meet O
those O
odious O
Rawdons S-PERSON
is O
at O
church O
, O
and O
that O
won’t O
amuse O
her O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
justly O
felt O
. O
“ O
We O
must O
go O
and O
visit O
our O
beautiful O
suburbs O
of O
London S-GPE
, O
” O
she O
then O
thought O
. O
“ O
I O
hear O
they O
are O
the O
most O
picturesque O
in O
the O
world O
| | O
” O
and O
so O
she O
had O
a O
sudden O
interest O
for O
Hampstead S-GPE
, O
and O
Hornsey S-PERSON
, O
and O
found O
that O
Dulwich S-PERSON
had O
great O
charms O
for O
her O
, O
and O
getting O
her O
victim O
into O
her O
carriage O
, O
drove O
her O
to O
those O
rustic O
spots O
, O
beguiling O
the O
little O
journeys O
with O
conversations O
about O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
telling O
every O
story O
to O
the O
old O
lady O
which O
could O
add O
to O
her O
indignation O
against O
this O
pair O
of O
reprobates O
. O
Perhaps O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
pulled O
the O
string O
unnecessarily O
tight O
. O
For O
though O
she O
worked O
up O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
to O
a O
proper O
dislike O
of O
her O
disobedient O
nephew O
, O
the O
invalid O
had O
a O
great O
hatred O
and O
secret O
terror O
of O
her O
victimizer O
, O
and O
panted O
to O
escape O
from O
her O
. O
After O
a O
brief O
space O
, O
she O
rebelled O
against O
Highgate S-GPE
and O
Hornsey S-PERSON
utterly O
. O
She O
would O
go O
into O
the O
Park O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
knew O
they O
would O
meet O
the O
abominable O
Rawdon S-PERSON
there O
, O
and O
she O
was O
right O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
day O
in O
the O
ring O
, O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
stanhope O
came O
in O
sight O
| | O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
seated O
by O
him O
. O
In O
the O
enemy’s O
equipage O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
occupied O
her O
usual O
place O
, O
with O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
on O
her O
left O
, O
the O
poodle O
and O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
on O
the O
back O
seat O
. O
It O
was O
a O
nervous O
moment O
, O
and O
Rebecca’s O
heart O
beat O
quick O
as O
she O
recognized O
the O
carriage O
| | O
and O
as O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
vehicles O
crossed O
each O
other O
in O
a O
line O
, O
she O
clasped O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
looked O
towards O
the O
spinster O
with O
a O
face O
of O
agonized O
attachment O
and O
devotion O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
himself O
trembled O
, O
and O
his O
face O
grew O
purple O
behind O
his O
dyed O
mustachios O
. O
Only O
old O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
moved O
in O
the O
other O
carriage O
, O
and O
cast O
her O
great O
eyes O
nervously O
towards O
her O
old O
friends O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
bonnet O
was O
resolutely O
turned O
towards O
the O
Serpentine S-LOC
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
happened O
to O
be O
in O
ecstasies O
with O
the O
poodle O
, O
and O
was O
calling O
him O
a O
little O
darling O
, O
and O
a O
sweet O
little O
zoggy O
, O
and O
a O
pretty O
pet O
. O
The O
carriages O
moved O
on O
, O
each O
in O
his O
line O
. O
“ O
Done O
, O
by O
Jove S-PERSON
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
wife O
. O
“ O
Try O
once O
more O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
answered O
. O
“ O
Could O
not O
you O
lock O
your O
wheels O
into O
theirs O
, O
dearest O
? O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
not O
the O
heart O
for O
that O
manœuvre O
. O
When O
the O
carriages O
met O
again O
, O
he O
stood O
up O
in O
his O
stanhope O
| | O
he O
raised O
his O
hand O
ready O
to O
doff O
his O
hat O
| | O
he O
looked O
with O
all O
his O
eyes O
. O
But O
this O
time O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
face O
was O
not O
turned O
away O
| | O
she O
and O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
looked O
him O
full O
in O
the O
face O
, O
and O
cut O
their O
nephew O
pitilessly O
. O
He O
sank O
back O
in O
his O
seat O
with O
an O
oath O
and O
striking O
out O
of O
the O
ring O
, O
dashed O
away O
desperately O
home O
, O
wards O
. O
It O
was O
a O
gallant O
and O
decided O
triumph O
for O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
. O
But O
she O
felt O
the O
danger O
of O
many O
such O
meetings O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
the O
evident O
nervousness O
of O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
| | O
and O
she O
determined O
that O
it O
was O
most O
necessary O
for O
her O
dear O
friend’s O
health O
, O
that O
they O
should O
leave O
town O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
recommended O
Brighton S-GPE
very O
strongly O
. O
XX O
. O
In O
Which O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
Acts E-PERSON
As O
the B-PERSON
Messenger I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Hymen E-PERSON
WITHOUT O
knowing O
how O
, O
Captain O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
found O
himself O
the O
great O
promoter O
, O
arranger O
, O
and O
manager O
of O
the O
match O
between O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
But O
for O
him O
it O
never O
would O
have O
taken O
place O
: O
he O
could O
not O
but O
confess O
as O
much O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
smiled O
rather O
bitterly O
as O
he O
thought O
that O
he O
of O
all O
men O
in O
the O
world O
should O
be O
the O
person O
upon O
whom O
the O
care O
of O
this O
marriage O
had O
fallen O
. O
But O
though O
indeed O
the O
conducting O
of O
this O
negotiation O
was O
about O
as O
painful O
a O
task O
as O
could O
be O
set O
to O
him O
, O
yet O
when O
he O
had O
a O
duty O
to O
perform O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
accustomed O
to O
go O
through O
it O
without O
many O
words O
or O
much O
hesitation O
: O
and O
, O
having O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
completely O
, O
that O
if O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
balked O
of O
her O
husband O
she O
would O
die O
of O
the O
disappointment O
, O
he O
was O
determined O
to O
use O
all O
his O
best O
endeavours O
to O
keep O
her O
alive O
. O
I O
forbear O
to O
enter O
into O
minute O
particulars O
of O
the O
interview O
between O
George S-PERSON
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
when O
the O
former O
was O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
feet O
( O
or O
should O
we O
venture O
to O
say O
the O
arms O
? O
) O
of O
his O
young O
mistress O
by O
the O
intervention O
of O
his O
friend O
honest O
William S-PERSON
. O
A O
much O
harder O
heart O
than O
George’s S-PERSON
would O
have O
melted O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
that O
sweet O
face O
so O
sadly O
ravaged O
by O
grief O
and O
despair O
, O
and O
at O
the O
simple O
tender O
accents O
in O
which O
she O
told O
her O
little O
broken O
- O
hearted O
story O
: O
but O
as O
she O
did O
not O
faint O
when O
her O
mother O
, O
trembling O
, O
brought O
Osborne S-PERSON
to O
her O
| | O
and O
as O
she O
only O
gave O
relief O
to O
her O
overcharged O
grief O
, O
by O
laying O
her O
head O
on O
her O
lover’s O
shoulder O
and O
there O
weeping O
for O
a O
while O
the O
most O
tender O
, O
copious O
, O
and O
refreshing O
tears O
— O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
too O
greatly O
relieved O
, O
thought O
it O
was O
best O
to O
leave O
the O
young O
persons O
to O
themselves O
| | O
and O
so O
quitted O
Emmy O
crying O
over O
George’s S-PERSON
hand O
, O
and O
kissing O
it O
humbly O
as O
if O
he O
were O
her O
supreme O
chief O
and O
master O
, O
and O
as O
if O
she O
were O
quite O
a O
guilty O
and O
unworthy O
person O
needing O
every O
favour O
and O
grace O
from O
him O
. O
This O
prostration O
and O
sweet O
unrepining O
obedience O
exquisitely O
touched O
and O
flattered O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
. O
He O
saw O
a O
slave O
before O
him O
in O
that O
simple O
yielding O
faithful O
creature O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
within O
him O
thrilled O
secretly O
somehow O
at O
the O
knowledge O
of O
his O
power O
. O
He O
would O
be O
generous O
- O
minded O
, O
Sultan S-PERSON
as O
he O
was O
, O
and O
raise O
up O
this O
kneeling O
Esther S-PERSON
and O
make O
a O
queen O
of O
her O
: O
besides O
, O
her O
sadness O
and O
beauty O
touched O
him O
as O
much O
as O
her O
submission O
, O
and O
so O
he O
cheered O
her O
, O
and O
raised O
her O
up O
and O
forgave O
her O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O
All O
her O
hopes O
and O
feelings O
, O
which O
were O
dying O
and O
withering O
, O
this O
her O
sun O
having O
been O
removed O
from O
her O
, O
bloomed O
again O
and O
at O
once O
, O
its O
light O
being O
restored O
. O
You O
would O
scarcely O
have O
recognized O
the O
beaming O
little O
face O
upon O
Amelia’s O
pillow O
that O
night O
as O
the O
one O
that O
was O
laid O
there O
the O
night O
before O
, O
so O
wan O
, O
so O
lifeless O
, O
so O
careless O
of O
all O
round O
about O
. O
The O
honest O
Irish S-NORP
maid O
- O
servant O
, O
delighted O
with O
the O
change O
, O
asked O
leave O
to O
kiss O
the O
face O
that O
had O
grown O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
so O
rosy O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
put O
her O
arms O
round O
the O
girl’s O
neck O
and O
kissed O
her O
with O
all O
her O
heart O
, O
like O
a O
child O
. O
She O
was O
little O
more O
. O
She O
had O
that O
night O
a O
sweet O
refreshing O
sleep O
, O
like O
one O
— O
and O
what O
a O
spring O
of O
inexpressible O
happiness O
as O
she O
woke O
in O
the O
morning O
sunshine O
! O
“ O
He O
will O
be O
here O
again O
to O
- O
day O
, O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
thought O
. O
“ O
He O
is O
the O
greatest O
and O
best O
of O
men O
. O
” O
And O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
George S-PERSON
thought O
he O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
generousest O
creatures O
alive O
: O
and O
that O
he O
was O
making O
a O
tremendous O
sacrifice O
in O
marrying O
this O
young O
creature O
. O
While O
she O
and O
Osborne S-PERSON
were O
having O
their O
delightful O
tête O
- O
à O
- O
tête O
above O
stairs O
, O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
and O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
were O
conversing O
below O
upon O
the O
state O
of O
the O
affairs O
, O
and O
the O
chances O
and O
future O
arrangements O
of O
the O
young O
people O
. O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
having O
brought O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
lovers O
together O
and O
left O
them O
embracing O
each O
other O
with O
all O
their O
might O
, O
like O
a O
true O
woman O
, O
was O
of O
opinion O
that O
no O
power O
on O
earth O
would O
induce O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
to O
consent O
to O
the O
match O
between O
his O
daughter O
and O
the O
son O
of O
a O
man O
who O
had O
so O
shamefully O
, O
wickedly O
, O
and O
monstrously O
treated O
him O
. O
And O
she O
told O
a O
long O
story O
about O
happier O
days O
and O
their O
earlier O
splendours O
, O
when O
Osborne S-PERSON
lived O
in O
a O
very O
humble O
way O
in O
the B-FAC
New I-FAC
Road E-FAC
, O
and O
his O
wife O
was O
too O
glad O
to O
receive O
some O
of O
Jos’s S-PERSON
little O
baby O
things O
, O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
accommodated O
her O
at O
the O
birth O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
own O
children O
. O
The O
fiendish O
ingratitude O
of O
that O
man O
, O
she O
was O
sure O
, O
had O
broken O
Mr. O
S.’s S-PERSON
heart O
: O
and O
as O
for O
a O
marriage O
, O
he O
would O
never O
, O
never O
, O
never O
, O
never O
consent O
. O
“ O
They O
must O
run O
away O
together O
, O
Ma’am O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
, O
laughing O
, O
“ O
and O
follow O
the O
example O
of O
Captain O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
and O
Miss O
Emmy’s S-PERSON
friend O
the O
little O
governess O
. O
” O
Was O
it O
possible O
? O
Well O
she O
never O
! O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
all O
excitement O
about O
this O
news O
. O
She O
wished O
that O
Blenkinsop S-PERSON
were O
here O
to O
hear O
it O
: O
Blenkinsop S-PERSON
always O
mistrusted O
that O
Miss O
Sharp S-PERSON
. O
— O
What O
an O
escape O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
had O
! O
and O
she O
described O
the O
already O
well O
- O
known O
love O
- O
passages O
between O
Rebecca S-PERSON
and O
the O
Collector O
of O
Boggley B-PERSON
Wollah E-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
not O
, O
however O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
wrath O
which O
Dobbin S-PERSON
feared O
, O
so O
much O
as O
that O
of O
the O
other O
parent O
concerned O
, O
and O
he O
owned O
that O
he O
had O
a O
very O
considerable O
doubt O
and O
anxiety O
respecting O
the O
behaviour O
of O
the O
black O
- O
browed O
old O
tyrant O
of O
a O
Russia S-GPE
merchant O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
. O
He O
has O
forbidden O
the O
match O
peremptorily O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
thought O
. O
He O
knew O
what O
a O
savage O
determined O
man O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
, O
and O
how O
he O
stuck O
by O
his O
word O
. O
“ O
The O
only O
chance O
George S-PERSON
has O
of O
reconcilement O
, O
” O
argued O
his O
friend O
, O
“ O
is O
by O
distinguishing O
himself O
in O
the O
coming O
campaign O
. O
If O
he O
dies O
they O
both O
go O
together O
. O
If O
he O
fails O
in O
distinction O
— O
what O
then O
? O
He O
has O
some O
money O
from O
his O
mother O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
— O
enough O
to O
purchase O
his O
majority O
— O
or O
he O
must O
sell O
out O
and O
go O
and O
dig O
in O
Canada S-GPE
, O
or O
rough O
it O
in O
a O
cottage O
in O
the O
country O
. O
” O
With O
such O
a O
partner O
Dobbin S-PERSON
thought O
he O
would O
not O
mind O
Siberia S-LOC
— O
and O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
this O
absurd O
and O
utterly O
imprudent O
young O
fellow O
never O
for O
a O
moment O
considered O
that O
the O
want O
of O
means O
to O
keep O
a O
nice O
carriage O

horses O
, O
and O
of O
an O
income O
which O
should O
enable O
its O
possessors O
to O
entertain O
their O
friends O
genteelly O
, O
ought O
to O
operate O
as O
bars O
to O
the O
union O
of O
George S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Sedley S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
these O
weighty O
considerations O
which O
made O
him O
think O
too O
that O
the O
marriage O
should O
take O
place O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O
Was O
he O
anxious O
himself O
, O
I O
wonder O
, O
to O
have O
it O
over O
? O
— O
as O
people O
, O
when O
death O
has O
occurred O
, O
like O
to O
press O
forward O
the O
funeral O
, O
or O
when O
a O
parting O
is O
resolved O
upon O
, O
hasten O
it O
. O
It O
is O
certain O
that O
Mr. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
having O
taken O
the O
matter O
in O
hand O
, O
was O
most O
extraordinarily O
eager O
in O
the O
conduct O
of O
it O
. O
He O
urged O
on O
George S-PERSON
the O
necessity O
of O
immediate O
action O
: O
he O
showed O
the O
chances O
of O
reconciliation O
with O
his O
father O
, O
which O
a O
favourable O
mention O
of O
his O
name O
in O
the O
Gazette S-ORG
must O
bring O
about O
. O
If O
need O
were O
he O
would O
go O
himself O
and O
brave O
both O
the O
fathers O
in O
the O
business O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
he O
besought O
George S-PERSON
to O
go O
through O
with O
it O
before O
the O
orders O
came O
, O
which O
everybody O
expected O
, O
for O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
regiment O
from O
England S-GPE
on O
foreign O
service O

Bent O
upon O

the O
applause O

consent O
of O
Mrs. O

not O

to O
break O
the O
matter O
personally O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
Mr. O

fate O
had O
overtaken O
him O

poor O

them O
up O

mysterious O
bundles O

several O

he O
carried O
in O
the O
flaps O

his O
coat O

I O
don’t O
know O
anything O
more O

that O

those O

builds O
his O

My O

no O

found O
the O
once O
florid O

jovial O

prosperous O
John B-PERSON

His O

so O
glossy O

was O
white O
at O
the O

have O
all O
the O

round O
him O

was O
quite O
painful O
to O

civil O

was O

John B-PERSON

As O

William B-PERSON

repeatedly O

the O
old O

called O
him O
“ O

A O
feeling O
of O
shame O

remorse O
took O
possession O
of O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
as O
the O
broken O
old O
man O

received O

addressed O
him O

guilty O

” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
hesitation O

protested O
that O

not O
in O
the O

hungry O

thirsty O

that O
he O
had O
no O
business O

only O
came O
to O
ask O
if O
Mr. O

well O
, O

to O
shake O
hands O
with O
an O
old O

added O

with O
a O
desperate O
perversion O
of O
truth O
, O
“ O
My O

The O

were O
wandering O

spoke O

he O
was O
thinking O

we O
gave O
’em O

could O
I O
suppose O

And O
I O
say O
that O
the O

A O
light O
of O
something O

break O
over O

wore O
something O

the O
astonishment O

when O
Osborne S-PERSON
had O
left O

Mr. O

how O
attached O

George B-PERSON

good O
feelings O

his O
good O

back O

him O

which O
they O
never O
dreamed O
he O
would O
resist O
. O
When O
the O
elder O
Osborne S-PERSON
gave O
what O
he O
called O
“ O
a O
hint O
, O
” O
there O
was O
no O
possibility O
for O
the O
most O
obtuse O
to O
mistake O
his O
meaning O

He O
called O
kicking O
a O
footman O
down O

stairs O

a O
hint O
to O
the O
latter O
to O
leave O
his O
service O

With O
his O
usual O
frankness O
and O
delicacy O
he O
told O
Mr. O
Haggistoun S-PERSON
that O
he O
would O
give O
her O
a O
cheque O
for O
five B-QUANTITY

called O
that O
proposal O
a O
hint O

and O
considered O
it O
a O
very O
dexterous O
piece O
of O
diplomacy O
. O
He O
gave O
George S-PERSON
finally O
such O
another O
hint O
regarding O
the O
heiress O

ordered O
him O
to O
marry O
her O
out O

hand O

his O
clerk O

write O
a O
letter O

This O
imperative O
hint O
disturbed O
George S-PERSON
a O
good O
deal O

He O
was O
in O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
enthusiasm O

delight O
of O
his O
second S-ORDINAL
courtship O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
which O
was O
inexpressibly O
sweet O
to O
him O
. O
The O
contrast O
of O
her O
manners O
and O
appearance O
with O
those O
of O
the O
heiress O
, O
made O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
union O
with O
the O
latter O
appear O
doubly O
ludicrous O
and O
odious O

Carriages O

opera-boxes O

fancy O

the O
side O
of O
such O

that O
! O
Add O
to O
all O

that O
the O
junior O
Osborne S-PERSON

it O

quite O
as O
violent O
when O
angered O

as O
his O
father O
in O
his O
most O
stern O
moments O
. O
On O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day E-DATE
when O
his O
father O
formally O
gave O
him O
the O
hint O
that O
he O
was O
to O
place O
his O
affections O
at O
Miss O

George S-PERSON
temporised O

then O
he O
represented O

time O

was O
daily O

with O
his O
majority O

“ O
for O

I O
promise O
you O

said O
he O
, O
with O
a O
satisfied O
air O
, O
“ O

” O
The O

George S-PERSON
interposed O

remark O
staggered O

and O
, O
taking O
all O
the O
young O
ladies’ O
flattery O
for O
genuine O
sentiment O
, O
and O
being O
, O
as O
we O
have O
before O

occasion O

of O
a O
very O
warm O

impetuous O
nature O

responded O
to O
their O
affection O

quite O
a O
tropical O
ardour O
. O
And O
if O
the O
truth O
may O
be O
told O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
that O
she O
too O
had O
some O
selfish O
attraction O
in O
the B-FAC
Russell I-FAC
Square E-FAC
house O

and O
in O
a O
word O
, O
thought O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
a O
very O
nice O
young O
man O
. O
His O
whiskers O
had O
made O
an O
impression O
upon O
her O
, O
on O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
night O
she O
beheld O
them O
at O
the O
ball O
at O
Messrs S-ORG
. O
Hulkers S-PERSON
| | O
and O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
she O
was O
not O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
woman O
who O
had O
been O
charmed O
by O
them O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
an O
air O
at O
once O
swaggering O
and O
melancholy O
, O
languid O
and O
fierce O
. O
He O
looked O
like O
a O
man O
who O
had O
passions O
, O
secrets O
, O
and O
private O
harrowing O
griefs O
and O
adventures O
. O
His O
voice O
was O
rich O
and O
deep O
. O
He O
would O
say O
it O
was O
a O
warm O
evening O
, O
or O
ask O
his O
partner O
to O
take O
an O
ice O
, O
with O
a O
tone O
as O
sad O
and O
confidential O
as O
if O
he O
were O
breaking O
her O
mother’s O
death O
to O
her O
, O
or O
preluding O
a O
declaration O
of O
love O
. O
He O
trampled O
over O
all O
the O
young O
bucks O
of O
his O
father’s O
circle O
, O
and O
was O
the O
hero O
among O
those O
third S-ORDINAL
- O
rate O
men O
. O
Some O
few O
sneered O
at O
him O
and O
hated O
him O
. O
Some O
, O
like O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
fanatically O
admired O
him O
. O
And O
his O
whiskers O
had O
begun O
to O
do O
their O
work O
, O
and O
to O
curl O
themselves O
round O
the O
affections O
of O
Miss O
Swartz S-PERSON
. O
Whenever O
there O
was O
a O
chance O
of O
meeting O
him O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
that O
simple O

good O
- O
natured O
young O
woman O
was O
quite O
in O
a O
flurry O
to O
see O
her O
dear O
Misses B-PERSON

She O
went O

great O

and O
bracelets O
, O
and O
bonnets O

and O
in O
prodigious O

She O
adorned O
her O
person O
with O
her O
utmost O
skill O
to O
please O
the O
Conqueror O
, O
and O
exhibited O
all O
her O
simple O
accomplishments O
to O
win O
his O
favour O
. O
The O
girls O
would O
ask O
her O
, O
with O
the O
greatest O
gravity O
, O
for O
a O
little O
music O
, O
and O
she O
would O
sing O
her O
three S-CARDINAL
songs O
and O
play O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
pieces O
as O
often O
as O

they O
asked O

and O
with O
an O
always O
increasing O
pleasure O
to O
herself O

During O
these O
delectable O

, O
Miss O

the O

talked O
about O
the O

The O

he O
was O
perfectly O
sick O

He O
contrasted O

volubility O
which O
surprised O
himself O
, O
and O
made O
his O
father O
doubly O
nervous O
for O
the O
fight O
which O
was O
to O
take O
place O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
ladies O
were O
gone O
. O
The O
difference O
between O
the O
pair O
was O
, O
that O
while O
the O
father O
was O
violent O
and O
a O
bully O
, O
the O
son O
had O
thrice O
the O
nerve O
and O
courage O
of O
the O
parent O
, O
and O
could O
not O
merely O
make O
an O
attack O
, O
but O
resist O
it O

and O
finding O
that O
the O
moment O
was O
now O
come O
when O
the O
contest O
between O
him O
and O
his O
father O
was O
to O
be O
decided O
, O
he O
took O
his O
dinner O
with O
perfect O
coolness O
and O
appetite O
before O
the O
engagement O
began O
. O
Old O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
was O
nervous O
, O
and O
drank O
much O
. O
He O
floundered O
in O
his O
conversation O
with O
the O
ladies O
, O
his O
neighbours O
: O
George’s S-PERSON
coolness O
only O
rendering O
him O
more O
angry O
. O
It O
made O
him O
half O
mad O
to O
see O
the O
calm O
way O
in O
which O
George S-PERSON
, O
flapping O
his O
napkin O
, O
and O
with O
a O
swaggering O
bow O
, O
opened O
the O
door O
for O
the O
ladies O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
| | O
and O
filling O
himself O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
, O
smacked O
it O
, O
and O
looked O
his O
father O
full O
in O
the O
face O
, O
as O
if O
to O
say O
, O
“ O
Gentlemen O
of O
the O

first S-ORDINAL

” O
The O
old O
man O
also O
took O
a O
supply O
of O
ammunition O
, O
but O
his O
decanter O
clinked O
against O
the O
glass O
as O
he O
tried O
to O
fill O
it O
. O
After O
giving O
a O
great O
heave O
, O
and O
with O
a O
purple O
choking O
face O
, O
he O
then O
began O
. O
“ O

says O
George S-PERSON
, O
“ O

a O

used O
to O
a O
Captain O

” O
“ O

can O

him O
off O

the O

” O
Whenever O
the O

assumed O
his O
haughty O
manner O
, O
it O
always O
created O
either O
great O
awe O

great O
irritation O
in O
the O
parent O
. O
Old O
Osborne S-PERSON
stood O
in O
secret O
terror O
of O
his O
son O
as O
a O
better O
gentleman O
than O
himself O

perhaps O
my O

their O
experience O
of O
this B-WORK_OF_ART

that O
there O
is O
no O
character O

a O
low O

man O
so O
much O
mistrusts O

as O
that O
of O

most O
sarcastic O

the O

felt O
himself O

only O
waited O

told O
the O

the O

at O
the O

the O

down O

the O
people O

clinked O
by O

left O
long O
reflections O

tattooed O
at O

in O

practised O
those O
desperate O

at O
amusement O

which O

employ O
when O
very O
anxious O

expectant O

perturbed O
in O

Some O
of O
his O
comrades O

used O
the O

joked O
him O
about O

Dobbin S-PERSON
laughed O

would O
send O
his O
acquaintance O
( O
Major O
Wagstaff S-PERSON

Engineers O

a O

when O
that O

took O

At O
length O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
made O
his O
appearance O
, O
very O
smartly O
dressed O
, O
but O
very O
pale O
and O
agitated O
as O
we O
have O
said O

He O
wiped O
his O
pale O
face O
with O
a O
large O
yellow O
bandanna O
pocket O
- O
handkerchief O
that O
was O
prodigiously O
scented O

He O
shook O
hands O
with O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
looked O
at O
the O

told O
John S-PERSON

the O
waiter O

to O
bring O
him O
some O
curaçoa O

Of O

off O

His O

“ O

No O

A O
coach O

Captain O

put O
his O

dressing O

waiting O

some O
time O

into O
this O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
hurried O
under O
an O
umbrella O
, O
and O
the O
valet O
mounted O
on O
the O
box O
, O
cursing O
the O
rain O
and O
the O
dampness O
of O
the O
coachman O
who O
was O
steaming O
beside O
him O
. O
“ O
We O
shall O
find O
a O

” O
says O
he O

“ O
that’s O
a O
comfort O

” O
And O
the O
carriage O
drove O
on O
, O
taking O
the O
road O
down O
Piccadilly S-GPE
, O
where O
Apsley B-FAC
House E-FAC

St. B-FAC
George’s I-FAC

wore O
red O

still O

where O
there O
were O
oil O

where O
Achilles S-PERSON

not O

the O

and O
so O
they O
drove O
down O
by O
Brompton S-GPE
to O
a O
certain O
chapel O
near O
the O
Fulham B-FAC

there O
. O
A O
chariot O
was O
in O
waiting O
with O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O

likewise O
a O
coach O
of O
the O
kind O
called O
glass O
coaches O

Only O
a O
very O
few O
idlers O
were O
collected O
on O
account O
of O
the O
dismal O
rain O

“ O
Hang O

George S-PERSON
, O
“ O
I O

” O
“ O
My O

Mr. O

Sedley’s E-PERSON

, O
who O
was O
in O
waiting O

and O
he O
and O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
man O
agreed O
as O
they O
followed O
George S-PERSON
and O
William S-PERSON
into O
the O
church O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
“ O
reg’lar O
shabby O

and O
with O
scarce O
so O
much O
as O
a O
breakfast O

a O
wedding O
faviour O
. O
” O
“ O
Here O
you O
are O
, O
” O
said O
our O
old O
friend O
, O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
, O
coming O
forward O
. O
“ O
You’re O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
late O

George S-PERSON
, O
my O
boy O

What O
a O
day O
, O
eh O
? O
Demmy S-PERSON
, O
it’s O
like O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
rainy O
season O
in O
Bengal S-GPE
. O
But O
you’ll O
find O
my O
carriage O
is O
water O
- O
tight O
. O
Come O
along O
, O
my O
mother O
and O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
are O
in O
the O
vestry O
. O
” O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
was O
splendid O
. O
He O
was O
fatter O
than O
ever O
. O
His O
shirt O
collars O
were O
higher O
| | O
his O
face O
was O
redder O
| | O
his O
shirt O
- O
frill O
flaunted O
gorgeously O
out O
of O
his O
variegated O
waistcoat O
. O
Varnished O
boots O
were O
not O
invented O
as O
yet O
| | O
but O
the O
Hessians S-NORP
on O
his O
beautiful O
legs O
shone O
so O
that O
they O
must O
have O
been O
the O
identical O
pair O
in O
which O
the O
gentleman O
in O
the O
old O
picture O
used O
to O
shave O
himself O

and O
on O
his O
light O
green O
coat O
there O
bloomed O
a O
fine O
wedding O
favour O
, O
like O
a O
great O
white O
spreading O
magnolia O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
George S-PERSON
had O
thrown O
the O
great O
cast O
. O
He O
was O
going O
to O
be O
married O
. O
Hence O
his O
pallor O
and O
nervousness O
— O
his O
sleepless O
night O
and O
agitation O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
people O
who O
have O
gone O
through O
the O
same O
thing O
own O
to O
the O
same O
emotion O
. O
After O
three S-CARDINAL
of O
four S-CARDINAL
ceremonies O
, O
you O
get O
accustomed O
to O
it O
, O
no O
doubt O
| | O
but O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
dip O
, O
everybody O
allows O
, O
is O
awful O
. O
The O
bride O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
brown O
silk O
pelisse O
( O
as O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
has O
since O
informed O
me O
) O
, O
and O
wore O
a O
straw O
bonnet O
with O
a O
pink O
ribbon O
| | O
over O
the O
bonnet O
she O
had O
a O
veil O
of O
white O
Chantilly O
lace O
, O
a O
gift O
from O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
, O
her O
brother O
. O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
himself O
had O
asked O
leave O
to O
present O
her O
with O
a O
gold O
chain O
and O
watch O
. O
Which O
she O
sported O
on O
this O
occasion O

and O
her O
mother O
gave O
her O
her O
diamond O
brooch O
— O
almost O
the O
only O
trinket O
which O
was O
left O
to O
the O
old O
lady O
. O
As O
the O
service O
went O
on O
, O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
sat O
and O
whimpered O
a O
great O
deal O
in O
a O
pew O
, O
consoled O
by O
the O
Irish S-NORP
maid O
- O
servant O
and O
Mrs. O
Clapp S-PERSON
from O
the O
lodgings O
. O
Old O
Sedley S-PERSON
would O
not O
be O
present O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
acted O
for O
his O
father O
, O
giving O
away O
the O
bride O
whilst O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
stepped O
up O
as O
groom’s O
- O
man O
to O
his O
friend O
George S-PERSON
. O
There O
was O
nobody O
in O
the O
church O
besides O
the O
officiating O
persons O
and O
the O
small O
marriage O
party O
and O
their O
attendants O
. O
The O
two S-CARDINAL
valets O
sat O
aloof O
superciliously O
. O
The O
rain O
came O
rattling O
down O
on O
the O
windows O
. O
In O
the O
intervals O
of O
the O
service O
you O
heard O
it O
, O
and O
the O
sobbing O
of O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
in O
the O
pew O
. O
The O
person’s O
tones O
echoed O
sadly O
through O
the O
empty O
walls O
. O
Osborne’s O
“ O
I O
will O
” O
was O
sounded O
in O
very O
deep O
bass O
. O
Emmy’s O
response O
came O
fluttering O
up O
to O
her O
lips O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
but O
was O
scarcely O
heard O
by O
anybody O
except O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
When O
the O
service O
was O
completed O
, O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
came O
forward O
and O
kissed O
his O
sister O
, O
the O
bride O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
for O
many O
months O
— O
George’s S-PERSON
look O
of O
gloom O
had O
gone O
, O
and O
he O
seemed O
quite O
proud O
and O
radiant O
. O
“ O
It’s O
your O
turn O
, O
William S-PERSON
, O
” O
says O
he O
, O
putting O
his O
hand O
fondly O
upon O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
shoulder O
| | O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
went O
up O
and O
touched O
Amelia S-PERSON
on O
the O
cheek O
. O
Then O
they O
went O
into O
the O
vestry O
and O
signed O
the O
register O
. O
“ O
God O
bless O
you O
, O
Old O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
said O
, O
grasping O
him O
by O
the O
hand O
, O
with O
something O
very O
like O
moisture O
glistening O
in O
his O
eyes O
. O
William S-PERSON
replied O
only O
by O
nodding O
his O
head O
. O
His O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
say O
much O
. O
“ O
Write O
directly O
, O
and O
come O
down O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
, O
you O
know O
, O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
. O
After O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
had O
taken O
an O
hysterical O
adieu O
of O
her O
daughter O
, O
the O
pair O
went O
off O
to O
the O
carriage O
. O
“ O
Get O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
you O
little O
devils O
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
cried O
to O
a O
small O
crowd O
of O
damp O
urchins O
that O
were O
hanging O
about O
the O
chapel O
- O
door O
. O
The O
rain O
drove O
into O

until O
Jos S-PERSON
presently O
joined O
them O
. O
Nor O
was O
he O
the O
only O
companion O
they O
found O
there O
. O
As O
they O
were O
coming O
into O
the O
Hotel O
from O
a O
sea O
- O
side O
walk O
one B-TIME

, O
on O
whom O
should O
they O
light O
but O
Rebecca S-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
. O
The O
recognition O
was O
immediate O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
flew O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
her O
dearest O
friend O
. O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
Osborne S-PERSON
shook O
hands O
together O
cordially O
enough O

and O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
very O
few O
hours O
, O
found O
means O
to O
make O
the O
latter O
forget O
that O
little O
unpleasant O
passage O
of O
words O
which O
had O
happened O
between O
them O
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
we O
met O
at O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
, O
when O
I O
was O
so O
rude O
to O
you O
, O
dear O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
? O
I O
thought O
you O
seemed O
careless O
about O
dear O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
that O
made O
me O
angry O
: O
and O
so O
pert O
: O
and O
so O
unkind O
: O
and O
so O
ungrateful O
. O
Do O
forgive O
me O
! O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
and O
she O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
with O
so O
frank O
and O
winning O
a O
grace O
, O
that O
Osborne S-PERSON
could O
not O
but O
take O
it O
. O
By O
humbly O
and O
frankly O
acknowledging O
yourself O
to O
be O
in O
the O
wrong O
, O
there O
is O
no O
knowing O
, O
my O
son O
, O
what O
good O
you O
may O
do O
. O
I O
knew O
once O
a O
gentleman O
and O
very O
worthy O
practitioner O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
, O
who O
used O
to O
do O
little O
wrongs O
to O
his O
neighbours O
on O
purpose O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
apologise O
for O
them O
in O
an O
open O
and O
manly O
way O
afterwards O
— O
and O
what O
ensued O
? O
My O
friend O
Crocky B-PERSON
Doyle E-PERSON
was O
liked O
everywhere O
, O
and O
deemed O
to O
be O
rather O
impetuous O
— O
but O
the O
honestest O
fellow O
. O
Becky’s S-PERSON
humility O
passed O
for O
sincerity O
with O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
. O
These O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
couples O
had O
plenty O
of O
tales O
to O
relate O
to O
each O
other O
. O
The O
marriages O
of O
either O
were O
discussed O

and O
their O
prospects O
in O
life O
canvassed O
with O
the O
greatest O
frankness O
and O
interest O
on O
both O
sides O
. O
George’s S-PERSON
marriage O
was O
to O
be O
made O
known O
to O
his O
father O
by O
his O
friend O
Captain B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON

and O
young O
Osborne S-PERSON
trembled O
rather O
for O
the O
result O
of O
that O
communication O
. O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
on O
whom O
all O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
hopes O
depended O
, O
still O
held O
out O
. O
Unable O
to O

an O
entry O
into O
her O
house O
in O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
, O
her O
affectionate O
nephew O

niece O
had O
followed O
her O
to O
Brighton S-GPE
, O
where O
they O
had O
emissaries O
continually O
planted O
at O
her O
door O
. O
“ O
I O
wish O
you O
could O

some O
of O
Rawdon’s S-NORP
friends O
who O

always O
about O
our O

, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
laughing O
. O
“ O
Did O
you O
ever O
see O
a O

my O

a O
bailiff O

all O
last B-DATE

If O

” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
with O
roars O
of O
laughter O
, O
related O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
amusing O
anecdotes O
of O
his O
duns O
, O
and O
Rebecca’s O
adroit O
treatment O
of O
them O

He O
vowed O
with O
a O
great O
oath O
, O
that O
there O
was O
no O
woman O
in O
Europe S-LOC
who O
could O
talk O
a O
creditor O
over O

she O
could O
. O
Almost O
immediately O
after O
their O
marriage O
, O
her O
practice O
had O
begun O
, O
and O
her O
husband O
found O
the O
immense O
value O
of O
such O
a O
wife O
. O
They O
had O
credit O
in O
plenty O
, O
but O
they O
had O
bills O
also O
in O
abundance O
, O
and O
laboured O
under O
a O
scarcity O
of O
ready O
money O
. O
Did O
these O
debt O
- O
difficulties O
affect O
Rawdon’s O
good O
spirits O
? O
No. O
Everybody O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
must O
have O
remarked O
how O
well O
those O
live O
who O
are O
comfortably O

thoroughly O
in O
debt O

how O

themselves O
nothing O

how O
jolly O

easy O
they O
are O
in O

Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O

had O
the O
very O
best O
apartments O
at O
the O

at O
Brighton S-GPE

the O

, O
bowed O
before O
them O
as O
to O
his O
greatest O
customers O
: O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
abused O
the O
dinners O
and O
wine O
with O
an O
audacity O
which O
no O
grandee O
in O
the O
land O
could O
surpass O
. O
Long O
custom O
, O
a O
manly O
appearance O

faultless O
boots O

clothes O
, O
and O
a O
happy O
fierceness O
of O

often O
help O
a O

as O
much O

a O
great O
balance O
at O
the O
banker’s O

The O
two S-CARDINAL
wedding O
parties O
met O
constantly O
in O
each O

After O
two B-DATE

the O

This O

the O

played O
a O
few O

at O

with O
Captain B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
replenished O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
purse O
somewhat O
, O
and O
gave O
him O
the O
benefit O
of O
that O
ready O
money O
for O
which O
the O
greatest O
spirits O
are O
sometimes O
at O
a O

So O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
walked O
down O
to O
see O
the O
Lightning S-PRODUCT

come O
in O

Punctual O
to O
the O

the O

out O

the O

blowing O
his O

the O
Lightning S-PRODUCT

down O

pulled O
up O
at O
the O

“ O
Hullo S-PERSON

George S-PERSON
cried O

shaking O
his O

warmly O
by O
the O

as O
soon O
as O
his O
descent O

Dobbin S-PERSON
bethought O
him O
that O
it O
would O

politic O
to O
make O

and O
, O
if O

They O
can’t O
be O
angry O
in O
their O

No O

ever O
was O
really O
angry O
at O
a O
romantic O

A O
little O
crying O
out O
, O

they O
must O
come O
round O
to O
their O

: O
when O
the O
three S-CARDINAL

will O
lay O
siege O
to O

So O
this O
Machiavellian S-NORP
captain O
of O

cast O
about O
him O
for O
some O
happy O
means O
of O
stratagem O
by O
which O
he O
could O
gently O
and O
gradually O
bring O
he O
Misses B-PERSON

to O
a O
knowledge O
of O
their O

secret O
. O
By O
a O
little O
inquiry O
regarding O
his O
mother’s O
engagements O
, O
he O
was O
pretty O
soon O
able O
to O
find O
out O
by O
whom O
of O
her O

friends O
parties O
were O
given O
at O
that O
season O

where O
he O
would O
be O
likely O
to O
meet O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
sisters O

, O
though O
he O
had O
that O
abhorrence O
of O
routs O

evening O
parties O
, O
which O
many O
sensible O
men O
, O
alas O

entertain O
, O
he O
soon O
found O
one O
where O
the B-PERSON

were O
to O

Making O
his O

he O
danced O
a O

was O
prodigiously O
polite O

actually O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
ask O

her O
news O
of O
the O
very O

What O
was O
it O
that O
made O

start O
back O

gaze O
upon O
him O
for O
a O

then O
on O

make O

most O
sincerely O

you O

We O
never O
thought O

though O
we O
were O
always O
very O
kind O
to O

very O

But O
papa O
will O
never O

I O
am O
sure O

And O
a O

up O
young O

with O
a O

George S-PERSON
must O
give O

up O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
indeed O
he O
must O

” O
“ O
Ought O
a O
man O
to O
give O
up O
the O
woman O
he O
loved O
, O
just O
when O
misfortune O
befel O
her O
? O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
, O
holding O
out O
his O
hand O
. O
“ O
Dear O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
is O
this O
the O
counsel O
I O
hear O
from O
you O
? O
My O
dear O
young O
lady O
! O
you O
must O
befriend O
her O
. O
He O
can’t O
give O
her O
up O
. O
He O
must O
not O
give O
her O
up O
. O
Would O
a O
man O
, O
think O
you O
, O
give O
you O
up O
if O
you O
were O
poor O
? O
” O
This O
adroit O
question O
touched O
the O
heart O
of O
Miss O
Jane B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
not O
a O
little O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
know O
whether O
we O
poor O
girls O
ought O
to O
believe O
what O
you O
men O
say O
, O
Captain O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
There O
is O
that O
in O
woman’s O
tenderness O
which O
induces O
her O
to O
believe O
too O
easily O
. O
I’m O
afraid O
you O
are O
cruel O
, O
cruel O
deceivers O
, O
” O
— O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
certainly O
thought O
he O
felt O
a O
pressure O
of O
the O
hand O
which O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
had O
extended O
to O
him O
. O
He O
dropped O
it O
in O
some O
alarm O
. O
“ O
Deceivers O
! O
” O
said O
he O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
dear O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
all O
men O
are O
not O

your O
brother O
is O
not O

George S-PERSON
has O
loved O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
ever O
since O
they O
were O
children O

no O
wealth O
would O
make O
him O
marry O
any O
but O
her O
. O
Ought O
he O
to O
forsake O
her O
? O
Would O
you O
counsel O
him O
to O
do O
so O
? O
” O
What O
could O
Miss O
Jane S-PERSON
say O
to O
such O
a O
question O
, O
and O
with O
her O
own O
peculiar O
views O
? O
She O
could O
not O
answer O
it O
, O
so O
she O
parried O
it O
by O
saying O
, O
“ O
Well O
, O
if O
you O
are O
not O
a O
deceiver O
, O
at O
least O
you O
are O
very O
romantic O
| | O
” O
and O
Captain O
William S-PERSON
let O
this O
observation O
pass O
without O
challenge O
. O
At O
length O
when O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
farther O
polite O
speeches O
, O
he O
deemed O
that O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
sufficiently O
prepared O
to O
receive O
the O
whole O
news O
, O
he O
poured O
it O
into O
her O
ear O
. O
“ O
George S-PERSON
could O
not O
give O
up O
Amelia S-PERSON
— O
George S-PERSON
was O
married O
to O
her O
” O
— O
and O
then O
he O
related O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
marriage O
as O
we O
know O
them O
already O
| | O
how O
the O
poor O
girl O
would O
have O
died O
had O
not O
her O
lover O
kept O
his O
faith O
: O
how O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
had O
refused O
all O
consent O
to O
the O
match O
, O
and O
a O
license O
had O
been O
got O
: O
and O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
had O
come O
from O
Cheltenham S-GPE
to O
give O
away O
the O
bride O
: O
how O
they O
had O
gone O
to O
Brighton S-GPE
in O
Jos’s S-GPE
chariot O
- O
and O
- O
four O
to O
pass O
the O
honeymoon O
: O
and O
how O
George S-PERSON
counted O
on O
his O
dear O
kind O
sisters O
to O
befriend O
him O
with O
their O
father O
, O
as O
women O
— O
so O
true O
and O
tender O
as O
they O
were O
— O
assuredly O
would O
do O
. O
And O
so O
, O
asking O
permission O
( O
readily O
granted O
) O
to O
see O
her O
again O
, O
and O
rightly O
conjecturing O
that O
the O
news O
he O
had O
brought O
would O
be O
told O
in O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
to O
the O
other O
ladies O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
made O
his O
bow O
and O
took O
his O
leave O
. O
He O
was O
scarcely O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
when O
Miss O
Maria S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Wirt S-PERSON
rushed O
in O
to O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
whole O
wonderful O
secret O
was O
imparted O
to O
them O
by O
that O
lady O
. O
To O
do O
them O
justice O
, O
neither O
of O
the O
sisters O
was O
very O
much O
displeased O
. O
There O
is O
something O
about O
a O
runaway O
match O
with O
which O
few O
ladies O
can O
be O
seriously O
angry O
, O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
rather O
rose O
in O
their O
estimation O
, O
from O
the O
spirit O
which O
she O
had O
displayed O
in O
consenting O
to O
the O
union O
. O
As O
they O
debated O
the O
story O
, O
and O
prattled O
about O
it O
, O
and O
wondered O
what O
papa O
would O
do O
and O
say O
, O
came O
a O
loud O
knock O
as O
of O
an O
avenging O
thunder O
- O
clap O
, O
at O
the O
door O
, O
which O
made O
these O
conspirators O
start O
. O
It O
must O
be O
papa O
, O
they O
thought O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
he O
. O
It O
was O
only O
Mr. O
Frederick B-PERSON
Bullock E-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
come O
from O
the O
City O
according O
to O
appointment O
, O
to O
conduct O
the O
ladies O
to O
a O
flower O
- O
show O
. O
This O
gentleman O
, O
as O
may O
be O
imagined O
, O
was O
not O
kept O
long O
in O
ignorance O
of O
the O
secret O
. O
But O
his O
face O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
it O
, O
showed O
an O
amazement O
which O
was O
very O
different O
to O
that O
look O
of O
sentimental O
wonder O
which O
the O
countenances O
of O
the O
sisters O
wore O
. O
Mr. O
Bullock S-PERSON
was O
a O
man O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
a O
junior O
partner O
of O
a O
wealthy O
firm O
. O
He O
knew O
what O
money O
was O
, O
and O
the O
value O
of O
it O
: O
and O
a O
delightful O
throb O
of O
expectation O
lighted O
up O
his O
little O
eyes O
, O
and O
caused O
him O
to O
smile O
on O
his O
Maria S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
thought O
that O
by O
this O
piece O
of O
folly O
of O
Mr. O
George’s S-PERSON
she O
might O
be O
worth O
thirty B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
more O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
hoped O
to O
get O
with O
her O
. O
“ O
Gad O
! O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
surveying O
even O
the O
elder O
sister O
with O
some O
interest O
, O
“ O
Eels S-PERSON
will O
be O
sorry O
he O
cried O
off O
. O
You O
may O
be O
a O
fifty B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
pounder O
yet O
. O
” O
The O
sisters O
had O
never O
thought O
of O
the O
money O
question O
up O
to O
that O
moment O
, O
but O
Fred B-PERSON
Bullock E-PERSON
bantered O
them O
with O
graceful O
gaiety O
about O
it O
during O
their O
forenoon’s O
excursion O
| | O
and O
they O
had O
risen O
not O
a O
little O
in O
their O
own O
esteem O
by O
the O
time O
when O
, O
the O
morning O
amusement O
over O
, O
they O
drove O
back O
to O
dinner O
. O
And O
do O
not O
let O
my O
respected O
reader O
exclaim O
against O
this O
selfishness O
as O
unnatural O
. O
It O
was O
but O
this O
present O
morning O
, O
as O
he O
rode O
on O
the O
omnibus O
from O
Richmond S-GPE
| | O
while O
it O
changed O
horses O
, O
this O
present O
chronicler O
, O
being O
on O
the O
roof O
, O
marked O
three S-CARDINAL
little O
children O
playing O
in O
a O
puddle O
below O
, O
very O
dirty O
, O
and O
friendly O
, O
and O
happy O
. O
To O
these O
three S-CARDINAL
presently O
came O
another O
little O
one O
. O
“ O
Polly S-PERSON
, O
” O
says O
she O
, O
“ O
your O
sister’s O
got O
a O
penny O
. O
” O
At O
which O
the O
children O
got O
up O
from O
the O
puddle O
instantly O
, O
and O
ran O
off O
to O
pay O
their O
court O
to O
Peggy S-PERSON
. O
And O
as O
the O
omnibus O
drove O
off O
, O
I O
saw O
Peggy S-PERSON
with O
the O
infantine O
procession O
at O
her O
tail O
, O
marching O
with O
great O
dignity O
towards O
the O
stall O
of O
a O
neighbouring O
lollipop O
- O
woman O
. O

In O
Which O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
Takes O
down O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Family I-WORK_OF_ART
Bible I-WORK_OF_ART
SO E-WORK_OF_ART
having O
prepared O
the O
sisters O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
hastened O
away O
to O
the O
City O
to O
perform O
the O
rest O
and O
more O
difficult O
part O
of O
the O
task O
which O
he O
had O
undertaken O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
facing O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
rendered O
him O
not O
a O
little O
nervous O
, O
and O
more O
than O
once O
he O
thought O
of O
leaving O
the O
young O
ladies O
to O
communicate O
the O
secret O
, O
which O
, O
as O
he O
was O
aware O
, O
they O
could O
not O
long O
retain O
. O
But O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
report O
to O
George S-PERSON
upon O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
elder O
Osborne S-PERSON
bore O
the O
intelligence O
| | O
so O
going O
into O
the O
City O
to O
the O
paternal O
countinghouse O
in O
Thames B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
he O
despatched O
thence O
a O
note O
to O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
begging O
for O
a O
half B-DATE
- I-DATE
hour’s E-DATE
conversation O
relative O
to O
the O
affairs O
of O
his O
son O
George S-PERSON
. O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
messenger O
returned O
from O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
house O
of O
business O
, O
with O
the O
compliments O
of O
the O
latter O
, O
who O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
the O
Captain O
immediately O
, O
and O
away O
accordingly O
Dobbin S-PERSON
went O
to O
confront O
him O
. O
The O
Captain O
, O
with O
a O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
guilty O
secret O
to O
confess O
, O
and O
with O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
painful O
and O
stormy O
interview O
before O
him O
, O
entered O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
offices O
with O
a O
most O
dismal O
countenance O
and O
abashed O
gait O
, O
and O
, O
passing O
through O
the O
outer O
room O
where O
Mr. O
Chopper S-PERSON
presided O
, O
was O
greeted O
by O
that O
functionary O
from O
his O
desk O
with O
a O
waggish O
air O
which O
farther O
discomfited O
him O
. O
Mr. O
Chopper S-PERSON
winked O
and O
nodded O
and O
pointed O
his O
pen O
towards O
his O
patron’s O
door O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
You’ll S-PERSON
find O
the O
governor O
all O
right O
, O
” O
with O
the O
most O
provoking O
good O
humour O
. O
Osborne S-PERSON
rose O
too O
, O
and O
shook O
him O
heartily O
by O
the O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
How O
do O
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
? O
” O
with O
a O
cordiality O
that O
made O
poor O
George’s S-PERSON
ambassador O
feel O
doubly O
guilty O
. O
His O
hand O
lay O
as O
if O
dead O
in O
the O
old O
gentelman’s O
grasp O
. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
was O
more O
or O
less O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
that O
had O
happened O
. O
It O
was O
he O
had O
brought O
back O
George S-PERSON
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
: O
it O
was O
he O
had O
applauded O
, O
encouraged O
, O
transacted O
almost O
the O
marriage O
which O
he O
was O
come O
to O
reveal O
to O
George’s S-PERSON
father O
: O
and O
the O
latter O
was O
receiving O
him O
with O
smiles O
of O
welcome O
| | O
patting O
him O
on O
the O
shoulder O
, O
and O
calling O
him O
“ O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
. O
” O
The O
envoy O
had O
indeed O
good O
reason O
to O
hang O
his O
head O
. O
Osborne S-PERSON
fully O
believed O
that O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
come O
to O
announce O
his O
son’s O
surrender O
. O
Mr. O
Chopper S-PERSON
and O
his O
principal O
were O
talking O
over O
the O
matter O
between O
George S-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
, O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
messenger O
arrived O
. O
Both O
agreed O
that O
George S-PERSON
was O
sending O
in O
his O
submission O
. O
Both O
had O
been O
expecting O
it O
for O
some O
days O
— O
and O
“ O
Lord O
! O
Chopper O

” O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
clerk O
, O
snapping O
his O
big O
fingers O
, O
and O
jingling O
all O
the O
guineas O
and O
shillings O
in O
his O
great O
pockets O
as O
he O
eyed O
his O
subordinate O
with O
a O
look O
of O
triumph O
. O
With O
similar O
operations O
conducted O
in O
both O
pockets O
, O
and O
a O
knowing O
jolly O
air O
, O
Osborne S-PERSON
from O
his O
chair O
regarded O
Dobbin S-PERSON
seated O
blank O
and O
silent O
opposite O
to O
him O
. O
“ O
What O
a O
bumpkin O
he O
is O
for O
a O
Captain O
in O
the O
army O
, O
” O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
thought O
. O
“ O
I O
wonder O
George S-PERSON
hasn’t O
taught O
him O
better O
manners O
. O
” O
At O
last O
Dobbin S-PERSON
summoned O
courage O
to O
begin O
. O
“ O
Sir O
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
“ O
I’ve O
brought O
you O
some O
very O
grave O
news O
. O
I O
have O
been O
at O
the B-FAC
Horse I-FAC
Guards E-FAC
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
and O
there’s O
no O
doubt O
that O
our O
regiment O
will O
be O
ordered O
abroad O
, O
and O
on O
its O
way O
to O
Belgium S-GPE
before O
the B-DATE
week E-DATE
is O
over O

And O
you O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
that O
we O
shan’t O
be O
home O
again O
before O
a O
tussle O
which O
may O
be O
fatal O
to O
many O
of O
us O
. O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
looked O
grave O
. O
“ O
My O
s O
— O
— O
, O
the O
regiment O
will O
do O
its O
duty O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
daresay O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
The O
French S-NORP
are O
very O
strong O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
went O
on O
. O
“ O
The O
Russians S-NORP

Austrians S-NORP
will O
be O
a O
long O
time O
before O

can O
bring O
their O

shall O
have O
the O

depend O
on O
it O
Boney S-PERSON
will O
take O

that O
it O
shall O
be O
a O
hard O
one O
. O
” O
“ O
What O
are O
you O
driving O
at O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
? O
” O
his O
interlocutor O
said O
, O
uneasy O
and O
with O
a O
scowl O
. O
“ O
I O
suppose O
no O
Briton’s S-PERSON
afraid O
of O
any O

” O
“ O
I O
only O
mean O
, O
that O
before O
we O
go O

and O
considering O
the O
great O
and O
certain O
risk O
that O
hangs O
over O
every O
one O
of O
us O
— O
if O
there O
are O
any O
differences O
between O
you O
and O
George S-PERSON
— O
it O
would O
be O
as O
well O
, O
sir O
, O
that O
— O
that O
you O
should O
shake O
hands O
: O
wouldn’t O
it O
? O
Should O
anything O
happen O
to O
him O
, O
I O
think O
you O
would O
never O
forgive O
yourself O
if O
you O
hadn’t O
parted O
in O
charity O
. O
” O
As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
poor O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
blushed O
crimson O
, O
and O
felt O
and O
owned O
that O
he O
himself O
was O
a O
traitor O
. O
But O
for O
him O
, O
perhaps O
, O
this O
severance O
need O
never O
have O
taken O
place O
. O
Why O
had O
not O
George’s S-PERSON
marriage O
been O
delayed O
? O
What O
call O
was O
there O
to O
press O
it O
on O
so O
eagerly O
? O
He O
felt O
that O
George S-PERSON
would O
have O
parted O
from O
Amelia S-PERSON
at O
any O
rate O
without O
a O
mortal O
pang O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
might O
have O
recovered O
the O
shock O
of O
losing O
him O
. O
It O
was O
his O
counsel O
had O
brought O
about O
this O
marriage O
, O
and O
all O
that O
was O
to O
ensue O
from O
it O
. O
And O
why O
was O
it O
? O
Because O
he O
loved O
her O
so O
much O
that O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
see O
her O
unhappy O
| | O
or O
because O
his O
own O
sufferings O
of O
suspense O
were O
so O
unendurable O
that O
he O
was O
glad O
to O
crush O
them O
at O
once O
— O
as O
we O
hasten O
a O
funeral O
after O
a O
death O
, O
or O
, O
when O
a O
separation O
from O
those O
we O
love O
is O
imminent O
, O
cannot O
rest O
until O
the O
parting O
be O
over O
. O
“ O
You O
are O
a O
good O
fellow O
, O
William S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
in O
a O
softened O
voice O
| | O
“ O
and O
me O
and O
George S-PERSON
shouldn’t O
part O
in O
anger O
, O
that O
is O
true O
. O
Look O
here O
. O
I’ve O
done O
for O
him O
as O
much O
as O
any O
father O
ever O
did O
. O
He’s O
had O
three S-CARDINAL
times O
as O
much O
money O
from O
me O
, O
as O
I O
warrant O
your O
father O
ever O
gave O
you O
. O
But O
I O
don’t O
brag O
about O
that O
. O
How O
I’ve O
toiled O
for O
him O
, O
and O
worked O
and O
employed O
my O
talents O
and O
energy O
, O
I O
won’t O
say O
. O
Ask O
Chopper S-PERSON
. O
Ask O
himself O
. O
Ask O
the B-GPE
City I-GPE
of I-GPE
London E-GPE
. O
Well O
, O
I O
proposed O
to O
him O
such O
a O
marriage O
as O
any O
nobleman O
in O
the O
land O
might O
be O
proud O
of O
— O
the O
only O
thing O
in O
life O
I O
ever O
asked O
him O
— O
and O
he O
refuses O
me O
. O
Am O
I O
wrong O
? O
Is O
the O
quarrel O
my O
making O
? O
What O
do O
I O
seek O
but O
his O
good O
, O
for O
which O
I’ve O
been O
toiling O
like O
a O
convict O
ever O
since O
he O
was O
born O
? O
Nobody O
can O
say O
there’s O
anything O
selfish O
in O
me O
. O
Let O
him O
come O
back O
. O
I O
say O
, O
here’s O
my O
hand O
. O
I O
say O
, O
forget O
and O
forgive O
. O
As O
for O
marrying O
now O
, O
it’s O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
Let O
him O
and O
Miss O
S. S-PERSON
make O
it O
up O
, O
and O
make O
out O
the O
marriage O

, O
when O
he O
comes O
back O

— O
he O
shall O

if O
money O
can O
do O
it O
. O
I’m O
glad O
you’ve O
brought O
him O
round O
. O
I O
know O
it’s O
you O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
You’ve S-PERSON
took O
him O
out O
of O
many O
a O
scrape O
before O

Let O
his O
come O

I O
shan’t O
be O
hard O

Come O
along O

” O
This O
praise O
and O
confidence O
smote O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
heart O
very O
keenly O
. O
Every O
moment O
the O
colloquy O
continued O
in O
this O
tone O
, O
he O
felt O
more O
and O
more O
guilty O
. O
“ O
Sir O

” O
said O
he O
, O
“ O
I O
fear O

much O
too O
high O

minded O
a O
man O
ever O
to O

A O
threat O
on O
your O
part O
that O
you O
would O
disinherit O
him O

” O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
still O
provoking O
good O
humour O
. O
“ O
Gad O

And O
the O
old O
gentleman O
gave O
his O
knowing O
grin O

coarse O
laugh O

“ O

Mr. O

continued O

gathering O
wrath O

astonishment O

the O
thought O

upon O

him O

Dobbin S-PERSON

almost O
pleased O
at O

Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
an O
especial O
favourite O
of O
this O
old O
General O

Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
versed O
in O
the O
literature O
of O
his O
profession O
, O
and O
could O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
Frederick S-PERSON

and O
the B-PERSON
Empress I-PERSON
Queen E-PERSON
, O
and O
their O
wars O
, O
almost O
as O
well O
as O
the O
General O
himself O
, O
who O
was O
indifferent O
to O
the O
triumphs O
of O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE
day E-DATE

and O
whose O
heart O
was O
with O
the O
tacticians O
of O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
back E-DATE
. O
This O
officer O
sent O
a O
summons O
to O
Dobbin S-PERSON
to O
come O
and O
breakfast O
with O
him O
, O
on O
the B-TIME

when O
Mr. O

altered O
his O

Mr. O

put O
on O
his O

then O
informed O
his O
young O

a B-DATE

all O

a O

Belgium S-GPE
. O
The O
order O
for O
the O

as O

would O
get O
their O

before O
the B-DATE

over O

Recruits O

Chatham S-GPE

and O
the O
old O
General O
hoped O

beat O
Montcalm S-GPE

Mr. O

would O
prove O

said O
the O
old O
General O

taking O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
with O
his O
trembling O
white O

then O
pointing O
to O
the O

of O
his O

his O
heart O
was O

With O
which O
the O
General O
gave O
his O

a O

shake O

a O

This O
news O
made O
Dobbin S-PERSON
grave O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
of O
our O
friends O
at O
Brighton S-GPE
, O

then O
he O
was O
ashamed O

returning O

he O
sent O
off O
a O
brief O

which O
might O

to O
bring O
about O
a O
reconciliation O

George S-PERSON

This O
note O

despatched O

the O

In O
was O
inclosed O

him O

as O
he O
opened O
the O

trembled O

the O
dinner O

be O
put O
off O
on O
which O
he O
was O
calculating O

His O
mind O
was O
inexpressibly O
relieved O

found O
that O

Dobbin S-PERSON

quite O
justified O

Mr. O

, O
as O
may O
be O
supposed O
from O
his O
size O

slenderness O
, O
was O
of O
the B-ORG
Light I-ORG
Bobs E-ORG

Ensign B-PERSON
Spooney E-PERSON

on O

Then O
these O

went O
off O
to O
the O
Slaughters O

having O
ordered O
a O
famous O
dinner O
, O
sat O
down O

wrote O
off O
letters O

the O
kind O

letters O
full O

pluck O

bad O

Ah O
! O
there O
were O
many O
anxious O
hearts O
beating O
through O
England S-GPE

that O
time O

and O
mothers’ O
prayers O

trickling O
down O
his O
nose O
on O

the O
paper O
( O
for O
the O
youngster O

who O
was O
going O
to O
write O
off O
a O
letter O
to O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON

relented O

locked O
up O
his O
desk O

“ O
Why O
should O

said O
he O

“ O

So O
he O
went O
up O

laid O
his O
big O
hand O
on O
young O
Stubble’s S-PERSON
shoulder O
, O
and O
backed O
up O
that O
young O
champion O

told O
him O
if O
he O
would O
leave O
off O

he O
would O
be O
a O

Young B-PERSON
Stubble’s E-PERSON

greatly O
respected O

“ O

rubbing O

The O

were O
at O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
the O
soft O

Captain’s O
eyes O
did O
not O

The O
two S-CARDINAL

the O
Captain O

Mr. O

the O
letter O
briefly O

it O
is O
true O

and O
his O
interview O
with O
his O
lawyer O

wondered O
how O
the O
governor O
had O
sworn O
at O
nobody O
, O
and O
— O
especially O
as O
the O
wine O
circled O
round O

abounded O
in O
speculations O

conjectures O

But O
these O
grew O
more O
vague O
with O
every O
glass O

at O
length O
became O
perfectly O
unintelligible O

At O
a B-TIME
late I-TIME
hour E-TIME
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
put O
his O
guest O

a O
hackney O
coach O

in O
a O
hiccupping O
state O

the O
kick O

the O
kick O

Captain’s O
friend O

When O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
took O
leave O
of O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
we O
have O
said O

him O

some B-TIME

when O
, O
perhaps O

asked O
her O

would O
have O
declared O
herself O

But O
though O

at O
the B-FAC
Ship I-FAC
Inn E-FAC
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
assumed O
a O
jovial O
and O
rattling O
manner O
, O
which O
proved O
that O
this O
young O
officer O
was O
becoming O
a O
more O
consummate O
hypocrite O
every O
day O
of O
his O
life O
. O
He O
was O
trying O
to O
hide O
his O
own O
private O
feelings O
, O
first S-ORDINAL
upon O
seeing O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
in O
her O
new O
condition O
, O
and O
secondly S-ORDINAL
to O
mask O
the O
apprehensions O
he O
entertained O
as O
to O
the O
effect O
which O
the O
dismal O
news O
brought O
down O
by O
him O
would O
certainly O
have O
upon O
her O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
my O
opinion O
, O
George S-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
that O
the O
French S-NORP
Emperor O
will O
be O
upon O
us O
, O
horse O

, O
before O
three B-DATE

will O
give O
the O

such O
a O
dance O
as O
shall O
make O
the O
Peninsula S-LOC
appear O
mere O
child’s O
play O
. O
But O
you O
need O
not O
say O
that O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
you O
know O
. O
There O
mayn’t O
be O
any O
fighting O
on O
our O
side O
after O
all O
, O

our O
business O
in O
Belgium S-GPE
may O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
a O
mere O
military O
occupation O
. O
Many O
persons O
think O
so O

and O
Brussels S-GPE
is O
full O
of O
fine O
people O
and O
ladies O
of O
fashion O
. O
” O
So O
it O
was O
agreed O
to O
represent O
the O
duty O
of O
the O
British S-NORP
army O
in O
Belgium S-GPE
in O
this O
harmless O
light O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
This O
plot O
being O
arranged O
, O
the O
hypocritical O
Dobbin S-PERSON
saluted O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
quite O
gaily O
, O
tried O
to O
pay O
her O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
compliments O
relative O
to O
her O
new O
position O
as O
a O
bride O
( O
which O
compliments O
, O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
, O
were O
exceedingly O
clumsy O
and O
hung O
fire O
woefully O
) O
, O
and O
then O
fell O
to O
talking O
about O
Brighton S-GPE
, O
and O
the O
sea-air O
, O
and O
the O
gaieties O
of O
the O
place O
, O
and O
the O
beauties O
of O
the O
road O
and O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
Lightning S-PRODUCT
coach O
and O
horses O
, O
— O
all O
in O
a O
manner O
quite O
incomprehensible O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
and O
very O
amusing O
to O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
watching O
the O
Captain O
, O
as O
indeed O
she O
watched O
every O
one O
near O
whom O
she O
came O
. O
Little O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
, O
had O
rather O
a O
mean O
opinion O
of O
her O
husband’s O
friend O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
He O
lisped O
— O
he O
was O
very O
plain O
and O
homely O
- O
lookin O
and O
exceedingly O
awkward O
and O
ungainly O
. O
She O
liked O
him O
for O
his O
attachment O
to O
her O
husband O
( O
to O
be O
sure O
there O
was O
very O
little O
merit O
in O
that O
) O
, O
and O
she O
thought O
George S-PERSON
was O
most O
generous O
and O
kind O
in O
extending O
his O
friendship O
to O
his O
brother O
officer O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
mimicked O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
lisp O
and O
queer O
manners O
many O
times O
to O
her O
, O
though O
to O
do O
him O
justice O
, O
he O
always O
spoke O
most O
highly O
of O
his O
friend’s O
good O
qualities O
. O
In O
her O
little O
day O
of O
triumph O
, O
and O
not O
knowing O
him O
intimately O
as O
yet O
, O
she O
made O
light O
of O
honest O
William S-PERSON
— O
and O
he O
knew O
her O
opinions O
of O
him O
quite O
well O
, O
and O
acquiesced O
in O
them O
very O
humbly O
. O
A O
time O
came O
when O
she O
knew O
him O
better O
, O
and O
changed O
her O
notions O
regarding O
him O
| | O
but O
that O
was O
distant O
as O
yet O
. O
As O
for O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
Captain B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
had O
not O
been O
two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
in O
the O
ladies’ O
company O
before O
she O
understood O
his O
secret O
perfectly O
. O
She O
did O
not O
like O
him O
, O
and O
feared O
him O
privately O
| | O
nor O
was O
he O
very O
much O
prepossessed O
in O
her O
favour O
. O
He O
was O
so O
honest O
, O
that O
her O
arts O
and O
cajoleries O
did O
not O
affect O
him O
, O
and O
he O
shrank O
from O
her O
with O
instinctive O
repulsion O
. O
And O
, O
as O
she O
was O
by O
no O
means O
so O
far O
superior O
to O
her O
sex O
as O
to O
be O
above O
jealousy O
, O
she O
disliked O
him O
the O
more O
for O
his O
adoration O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
she O
was O
very O
respectful O
and O
cordial O
in O
her O
manner O
towards O
him O
. O
A O
friend O
to O
the O
Osbornes S-PERSON
! O
a O
friend O
to O
her O
dearest O
benefactors O
! O
She O
vowed O
she O
should O
always O
love O
him O
sincerely O
: O
she O
remembered O
him O
quite O
well O
on O
the O
Vauxhall S-ORG
night O
, O
as O
she O
told O
Amelia S-PERSON
archly O
, O
and O
she O
made O
a O
little O
fun O
of O
him O
when O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O
went O
to O
dress O
for O
dinner O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
paid O
scarcely O
any O
attention O
to O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
looking O
upon O
him O
as O
a O
good O
- O
natured O
nincompoop O
, O
an O
underbred O
City O
man O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
patronised O
him O
with O
much O
dignity O
. O
When O
George S-PERSON
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
were O
alone O
in O
the O
latter’s O
room O
, O
to O
which O
George S-PERSON
had O
followed O
him O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
took O
from O
his O
desk O
the O
letter O
which O
he O
had O
been O
charged O
by O
Mr. O

“ O

said O
George S-PERSON
, O
looking O
rather O
alarmed O

was O
it O
: O
the O

from O
Mr. O

to O
the O
following O

: O

I O

” O
he O
added O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
. O
Whereupon O
the O
dispute O
ended O
— O
as O
many O
scores O
of O
such O
conversations O
between O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
his O
friend O
had O
concluded O
previously O
— O
by O
the O
former O
declaring O
there O
was O
no O
possibility O
of O
being O
angry O
with O
Dobbin S-PERSON
long O
, O
and O
forgiving O
him O
very O
generously O
after O
abusing O
him O
without O
cause O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
” O
cried O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
out O
of O
his O
dressing O
- O
room O
, O
to O
his O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
attiring O
herself O
for O
dinner O
in O
her O
own O
chamber O
. O
“ O
What O
? O
” O
said O
Becky’s S-PERSON
shrill O
voice O
. O
She O
was O
looking O
over O
her O
shoulder O
in O
the O
glass O
. O
She O
had O
put O
on O
the O
neatest O
and O
freshest O
white O
frock O
imaginable O
, O
and O
with O
bare O
shoulders O
and O
a O
little O
necklace O
, O
and O
a O
light O
blue O
sash O
, O
she O
looked O
the O
image O
of O
youthful O
innocence O
and O
girlish O
happiness O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
, O
what’ll O
Mrs. O
O. S-PERSON
do O
. O
when O
O. O
goes O
out O
with O
the O
regiment O
? O
” O
Crawley S-PERSON
said O
coming O
into O
the O
room O
, O
performing O
a O
duet O
on O
his O
head O
with O
two S-CARDINAL
huge O
hair O
- O
brushes O
, O
and O
looking O
out O
from O
under O
his O
hair O
with O
admiration O
on O
his O
pretty O
little O
wife O
. O
“ O
I O
suppose O
she’ll O
cry O
her O
eyes O
out O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
answered O
. O
“ O
She O
has O
been O
whimpering O
half B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
times O
, O
at O
the O
very O
notion O
of O
it O
, O
already O
to O
me O
. O
” O
You O
don’t O
care O
, O
I O
suppose O
? O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
, O
half S-CARDINAL
angry O
at O
his O
wife’s O
want O
of O
feeling O
. O
“ O
You O
wretch O
! O
don’t O
you O
know O
that O
I O
intend O
to O
go O
with O
you O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
replied O
. O
“ O
Besides O
, O
you’re O
different O

You O
go O
as O
General O
Tufo’s S-PERSON

. O
We O
don’t O
belong O
to O
the O

, O
” O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
said O
, O
throwing O
up O
her O
head O
with O
an O
air O
that O
so O
enchanted O
her O
husband O
that O
he O
stooped O
down O
and O
kissed O
it O
. O
“ O
Rawdon S-PERSON
dear O
— O
don’t O
you O
think O
— O
you’d O
better O
get O
that O
— O
money O
from O
Cupid S-PERSON
, O
before O
he O
goes O
? O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
continued O
, O
fixing O
on O
a O
killing O
bow O
. O
She O
called O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
, O
Cupid S-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
flattered O
him O
about O
his O
good O
looks O
a O
score O
of O
times O
already O
. O
She O
watched O
over O
him O
kindly O
at O
ècartè O
of O
a O
night O
when O
he O
would O
drop O
in O
to O
Rawdon’s S-GPE
quarters O
for O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
bed O
- O
time O
. O
She O
had O
often O
called O
him O
a O
horrid O
dissipated O
wretch O
, O
and O
threatened O
to O
tell O
Emmy S-PERSON
of O
his O
wicked O
ways O
and O
naughty O
extravagant O
habits O
. O
She O
brought O
his O
cigar O
and O
lighted O
it O
for O
him O
| | O
she O
knew O
the O
effect O
of O
that O
manœuvre O
, O
having O
practised O
it O
in O
former O
days O
upon O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
. O
He O
thought O
her O
gay O
, O
brisk O
, O
arch O
, O
destinguée O
, O
delightful O
. O
In O
their O
little O
drives O
and O
dinners O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
quite O
outshone O
poor O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
who O
remained O
very O
mute O
and O
timid O
while O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
rattled O
away O
together O
, O
and O
Captain B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
( O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
after O
he O
joined O
the O
young O
married O
people O
) O
gobbled O
in O
silence O
. O
Emmy’s O
mind O
somehow O
misgave O
her O
about O
her O
friend O
. O
Rebecca’s O
wit O
, O
spirits O
, O
and O
accomplishments O
troubled O
her O
with O
a O
rueful O
disquiet O
. O
They O
were O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
married O
, O
and O
here O
was O
George S-PERSON
already O
suffering O
ennui O
, O
and O
eager O
for O
othres’ O
society O
! O
She O
trembled O
for O
the O
future O
. O
How O
shall O
I O
be O
a O
companion O
for O
him O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
— O
so O
clever O
and O
so O
brilliant O
, O
and O
I O
such O
a O
humble O
foolish O
creature O
? O
How O
noble O
it O
was O
of O
him O
to O
marry O
me O
— O
to O
give O
up O
everything O
and O
stoop O
down O
to O
me O
! O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
refused O
him O
, O
only O
I O
had O
not O
the O
heart O
. O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
stopped O
at O
home O
and O
taken O
care O
of O
poor O
papa O
. O
And O
her O
neglect O
of O
her O
parents O
( O
and O
indeed O
there O
was O
some O
foundation O
for O
this O
charge O
which O
the O
poor O
child’s O
uneasy O
conscience O
brought O
against O
her O
) O
was O
now O
remembered O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
caused O
her O
to O
blush O
with O
humiliation O
. O
Oh O
! O
thought O
she O
, O
I O
have O
been O
very O
wicked O
and O
selfish O
— O
selfish O
in O
forgetting O
them O
in O
their O
sorrows O
— O
selfish O
in O
forcing O
George S-PERSON
to O
marry O
me O
. O
I O
know O
I’m O
not O
worthy O
of O
him O
— O
I O
know O
he O
would O
have O
been O
happy O
without O
me O
— O
and O
yet O
— O
I O
tried O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
give O
him O
up O
. O
It O
is O
hard O
when O
before O
seven B-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
marriage O
are O
over O
, O
such O
thoughts O
and O
confessions O
as O
these O
force O
themselves O
on O
a O
little O
bride’s O
mind O
. O
But O
so O
it O
was O
, O
and O
the O
night O
before O
Dobbin S-PERSON
came O
to O
join O
these O
young O
people O
— O
on O
a O
fine O
brilliant O
moonlight O
night O
of O
May S-DATE
— O
so O
warm O
and O
balmy O
that O
the O
windows O
were O
flung O
open O
to O
the O
balcony O
, O
from O
which O
George S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
were O
gazing O
upon O
the O
calm O
ocean O
spread O
shining O
before O
them O
, O
while O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
Jos S-PERSON
were O
engaged O
at O
backgammon O
within O
— O
Amelia S-PERSON
couched O
in O
a O
great O
chair O
quite O
neglected O
, O
and O
watching O
both O
these O
parties O
, O
felt O
a O
despair O
and O
remorse O
such O
as O
were O
bitter O
companions O
for O
that O
tender O
lonely O
soul O
. O
Scarce O
a O
week O
was O
past O
, O
and O
it O
was O
come O
to O
this O
! O
The O
future O
, O
had O
she O
regarded O
it O
, O
offered O
a O
dismal O
prospect O
| | O
but O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
too O
shy O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
to O
look O
to O
that O
, O
and O
embark O
alone O
on O
that O
wide O
sea O
, O
and O
unfit O
to O
navigate O
it O
without O
a O
guide O
and O
protector O
. O
I O
know O
Miss O
Smith S-PERSON
has O
a O
mean O
opinion O
of O
her O
. O
But O
how O
many O
, O
my O
dear O
Madam S-PERSON
, O
are O
endowed O
with O
your O
prodigious O
strength O
of O
mind O
? O
“ O
Gad O
, O
what O
a O
fine O
night O
, O
and O
how O
bright O
the O
moon O
is O
! O
” O
George S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O
puff O
of O
his O
cigar O
, O
which O
went O
soaring O
up O
skywards O
. O
“ O
How O
delicious O
they O
smell O
in O
the O
open O
air O
! O
I O
adore O
them O
. O
Who’d O
think O
the O
moon O
was O
two B-QUANTITY

thirty I-QUANTITY

off O
? O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
added O
, O
gazing O
at O
that O
orb O
with O
a O
smile O
. O
“ O
Isn’t O
it O
clever O
of O
me O
to O
remember O
that O
? O
Pooh O
! O
we O
learned O
it O
all O
at O
Miss O
Pinkerton’s O
! O
How O
calm O
the O
sea O
is O
, O
and O
how O
clear O
everything O
. O
I O
declare O
I O
can O
almost O
see O
the O
coast O
of O
France S-GPE
! O
” O
and O
her O
bright O
green O
eyes O
streamed O
out O
, O
and O
shot O
into O
the O
night O
as O
if O
they O
could O
see O
through O
it O

“ O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
I O
intend O
to O
do O
one O
morning O
? O
” O
she O
said O

“ O
I O
find O
I O
can O
swim O
beautifully O

long O
wisps O
of O

out O
to O
bathe O

insist O
on O
a O
reconciliation O

the O
water O

Isn’t O
that O
a O
stratagem O

George S-PERSON
burst O
out O
laughing O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
this O
aquatic O
meeting O

“ O

you O

Rawdon S-PERSON
shouted O
out O

rattling O
the O
box O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
making O
a O
fool O
of O
herself O
in O
an O
absurd O
hysterical O
manner O
, O
and O
retired O
to O
her O
own O
room O
to O
whimper O
in O
private O

Our O

in O
this O
chapter O
to O
go O
backwards O

so O
that O
the O

Although O
all O

before O
the O
dinner O
, O
which O
took O
place O
as O
usual O
on O
the O
day O
of O
Dobbin’s S-EVENT
arrival O
. O
George S-PERSON
was O
too O
humane O
or O
too O
much O
occupied O
with O
the O
tie O
of O
his O
neckcloth O
to O
convey O
at O
once O
all O
the O
news O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
which O
his O
comrade O
had O
brought O
with O
him O
from O
London S-GPE
. O
He O
came O
into O
her O
room O
, O
however O
, O
holding O
the O
attorney’s O
letter O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
with O
so O
solemn O
and O
important O
an O
air O
that O
his O
wife O
, O
always O
ingeniously O
on O
the O
watch O
for O
calamity O
, O
thought O
the O
worst O
was O
about O
to O
befall O
, O
and O
running O
up O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
besought O
her O
dearest O
George S-PERSON
to O
tell O
her O
everything O
— O
he O
was O
ordered O
abroad O
| | O
there O
would O
be O
a O
battle O
next B-DATE
week E-DATE
— O
she O
knew O
there O
would O
. O
Dearest O
George S-PERSON
parried O
the O
question O
about O
foreign O
service O
, O
and O
with O
a O
melancholy O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
said O
, O
“ O
No O
, O
Emmy O
| | O
it O
isn’t O
that O
: O
it’s O
not O
myself O
I O
care O
about O
: O
it’s O
you O
. O
I O
have O
had O
bad O
news O
from O
my O
father O
. O
He O
refuses O
any O
communication O
with O
me O
| | O
he O
has O
flung O
us O
off O
| | O
and O
leaves O
us O
to O
poverty O
. O
I O
can O
rough O
it O
well O
enough O

but O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
how O
will O
you O
bear O
it O
? O
read O
here O
. O
” O
And O
he O
handed O
her O
over O
the O
letter O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
tender O
alarm O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
listened O
to O
her O
noble O
hero O
as O
he O
uttered O
the O
above O
generous O
sentiments O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
on O
the O
bed O
, O
read O
the O
letter O
which O
George S-PERSON
gave O
her O
with O
such O
a O
pompous O
martyr O
- O
like O
air O
. O
Her O
face O
cleared O
up O
as O
she O
read O
the O
document O
, O
however O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
sharing O
poverty O
and O
privation O
in O
company O
with O
the O
beloved O
object O
is O
, O
as O
we O
have O
before O
said O
, O
far O
from O
being O
disagreeable O
to O
a O
warm O
- O
hearted O
woman O
. O
The O
notion O
was O
actually O
pleasant O
to O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
Then O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
she O
was O
ashamed O
of O
herself O
for O
feeling O
happy O
at O
such O
an O
indecorous O
moment O
, O
and O
checked O
her O
pleasure O
, O
saying O
demurely O
, O
“ O
O O
, O
George S-PERSON
, O
how O
your O
poor O
heart O
must O
bleed O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
separated O
from O
your O
papa O
! O
” O
“ O
It O
does O
, O
” O
said O
George S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
agonised O
countenance O
. O
“ O
But O
he O
can’t O
be O
angry O
with O
you O
long O
, O
” O
she O
continued O
. O
“ O
Nobody O
could O
, O
I’m O
sure O
. O
He O
must O
forgive O
you O

O O
, O
I O

” O
“ O
What O
vexes O
me O
, O
my O
poor O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
is O
not O
my O
misfortune O
, O
but O
yours O
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
care O
for O
a O
little O
poverty O

and O
I O
think O
, O
without O
vanity O
, O
I’ve O
talents O
enough O

make O
my O

” O
“ O
That O
you O

” O
interposed O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
thought O
that O
war O
should O
cease O
, O
and O
her O
husband O
should O
be O
made O
a O
general O

. O
“ O
Yes O
, O
I O
shall O
make O
my O
way O
as O
well O
as O
another O

” O
Osborne S-PERSON
went O
on O

“ O
but O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
girl O
, O
how O
can O
I O
bear O
your O
being O
deprived O
of O
the O
comforts O
and O
station O
in O
society O
which O
my O
wife O
had O
a O
right O
to O
expect O

My O
dearest O

in O
barracks O

the O
wife O
of O
a O
soldier O
in O
a O
marching O
regiment O

subject O
to O
all O
sorts O
of O
annoyance O
and O
privation O
! O
It O
makes O
me O
miserable O
. O
” O
Emmy O
, O
quite O
at O
ease O
, O
as O
this O
was O
her O
husband’s O
only O
cause O
of O
disquiet O
, O
took O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
with O
a O
radiant O
face O
and O
smile O
began O
to O
warble O
that O
stanza O
from O
the O
favourite O
song O
of O
“ O
Wapping B-WORK_OF_ART
Old I-WORK_OF_ART
Stairs E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
” O
in O
which O
the O
heroine O
, O
after O
rebuking O
her O
Tom S-PERSON
for O
inattention O
, O
promises O
“ O
his O
trowsers O
to O
mend O
, O
and O
his O
grog O
too O
to O
make O
, O
” O
if O
he O
will O
be O
constant O
and O
kind O
, O
and O
not O
forsake O
her O
. O
“ O
Besides O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
during O
which O
she O
looked O
as O
pretty O
and O
happy O
as O
any O
young O
woman O
need O
, O
“ O
isn’t O
two B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
an O
immense O
deal O
of O
money O
, O
George S-PERSON
? O
” O
George S-PERSON
laughed O
at O
her O
naïveté O
| | O
and O
finally O
they O
went O
down O
to O
dinner O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
clinging O
to O
George’s S-PERSON
arm O
, O
still O
warbling O
the O
tune O
of O
“ O
Wapping B-WORK_OF_ART
Old I-WORK_OF_ART
Stairs E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
” O
and O
more O
pleased O
and O
light O
of O
mind O
than O
she O
had O
been O
for O
some O
days O
past O
. O
Thus O
the O
repast O
, O
which O
at O
length O
came O
off O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
dismal O
, O
was O
an O
exceedingly O
brisk O
and O
merry O
one O
. O
The O
excitement O
of O
the O
campaign O
counteracted O
in O
George’s S-PERSON
mind O
the O
depression O
occasioned O
by O
the O
disinheriting O
letter O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
still O
kept O
up O
his O
character O
of O
rattle O
. O
He O
amused O
the O
company O
with O
accounts O
of O
the O
army O
in O
Belgium S-GPE
, O
where O
nothing O
but O
fêtes O
and O
gaiety O
and O
fashion O
were O
going O
on O
. O
Then O
, O
having O
a O
particular O
end O
in O
view O
, O
this O
dexterous O
captain O
proceeded O
to O
describe O
Mrs. O
Major B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
packing O
her O
own O
and O
her O
Major’s O
wardrobe O
, O
and O
how O
his O
best O
epaulets O
had O
been O
stowed O
into O
a O
tea O
canister O
, O
whilst O
her O
own O
famous O
yellow O
turban O
, O
with O
the O
bird O
of O
paradise O
wrapped O
in O
brown O
paper O
, O
was O
locked O
up O
in O
the O
Major’s O
tin O
cocked O
- O
hat O
case O
, O
and O
wondered O
what O
effect O
it O
would O
have O
at O
the O
French S-NORP
king’s O
court O
at O
Ghent S-GPE
, O
or O
the O
great O
military O
balls O
at O
Brussels S-GPE
. O
“ O
Ghent O
! O
Brussels S-GPE
! O
” O
cried O
out O
Amelia S-PERSON
with O
a O
sudden O
shock O
and O
start O
. O
“ O
Is O
the O
regiment O
ordered O
away O
, O
George S-PERSON
, O
— O
is O
it O
ordered O
away O
? O
” O
A O
look O
of O
terror O
came O
over O
the O
sweet O
smiling O
face O
, O
and O
she O
clung O
to O
George S-PERSON
as O
by O
an O
instinct O
. O
“ O
Don’t O
be O
afraid O
, O
dear O
, O
” O
he O
said O
good O
- O
naturedly O
| | O
“ O
it O
is O
but O
a O
twelve O
hours’ O
passage O
. O
It O
won’t O
hurt O
you O
. O
You O
shall O
go O
, O
too O
, O
Emmy O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
intend O
to O
go O
, O
” O
said O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I’m O
on O
the O
staff O
. O
General O
Tufto S-PERSON
is O
a O
great O
flirt O
of O
mine O
. O
Isn’t O
he O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
? O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
laughed O
out O
with O
his O
usual O
roar O
. O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
flushed O
up O
quite O
red O
. O
“ O
She O
can’t O
go O
, O
” O
he O
said O
| | O
“ O
think O
of O
the O
— O
of O
the O
danger O
, O
” O
he O
was O
going O
to O
add O
| | O
but O
had O
not O
all O
this O
conversation O
during O
dinner O
- O
time O
tended O
to O
prove O
there O
was O
none O
? O
He O
became O
very O
confused O
and O
silent O
. O
“ O
I O
must O
and O
will O
go O
, O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
cried O
with O
the O
greatest O
spirit O
| | O
and O
George S-PERSON
, O
applauding O
her O
resolution O
, O
patted O
her O
under O
the O
chin O
, O
and O
asked O
all O
the O
persons O
present O
if O
they O
ever O
saw O
such O
a O
termagant O
of O
a O
wife O
, O
and O
agreed O
that O
the O
lady O
should O
bear O
him O
company O
. O
“ O
We’ll S-PERSON
have O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
to O
chaperon O
you O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
What O
cared O
she O
so O
long O
as O
her O
husband O
was O
near O
her O
? O
Thus O
somehow O
the O
bitterness O
of O
a O
parting O
was O
juggled O
away O
. O
Though O
war O
and O
danger O
were O
in O
store O
, O
war O
and O
danger O
might O
not O
befall O
for O
months S-DATE
to O
come O
. O
There O
was O
a O
respite O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
which O
made O
the O
timid O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
almost O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
full O
reprieve O
would O
have O
done O
, O
and O
which O
even O
Dobbin S-PERSON
owned O
in O
his O
heart O
was O
very O
welcome O
. O
For O
, O
to O
be O
permitted O
to O
see O
her O
was O
now O
the O
greatest O
privilege O
and O
hope O
of O
his O
life O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
with O
himself O
secretly O
how O
he O
would O
watch O
and O
protect O
her O
. O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
let O
her O
go O
if O
I O
had O
been O
married O
to O
her O
, O
he O
thought O
. O
But O
George S-PERSON
was O
the O
master O
, O
and O
his O
friend O
did O
not O
think O
fit O
to O
remonstrate O
. O
Putting O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
friend’s O
waist O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
at O
length O
carried O
Amelia S-PERSON
off O
from O
the O
dinner O
- O
table O
where O
so O
much O
business O
of O
importance O
had O
been O
discussed O
, O
and O
left O
the O
gentlemen O
in O
a O
highly O
exhilarated O
state O
, O
drinking O
and O
talking O
very O
gaily O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
Rawdon S-PERSON
got O
a O
little O
family O
- O
note O
from O
his O
wife O
, O
which O
, O
although O
he O
crumpled O
it O
up O
and O
burnt O
it O
instantly O
in O
the O
candle O
, O
we O
had O
the O
good O
luck O
to O
read O
over O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
shoulder O
. O
“ O
Great O
news O
, O
” O
she O
wrote O
. O
“ O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON

” O
So O
when O
the O
little O
company O
was O
about O
adjourning O
to O
coffee O
in O
the O
women’s O
apartment O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
touched O
Osborne S-PERSON
on O
the O
elbow O
, O
and O
said O
gracefully O
, O
“ O
I O
say O
, O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
my O
boy O

” O
It O
was O
not O
quite O
convenient O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
George S-PERSON
gave O
him O
a O
considerable O
present O
instalment O
in O
bank O
- O
notes O
from O
his O
pocket O
- O
book O
, O
and O
a O

on O
his O
agents O
at O
a O
week’s O
date O
, O
for O
the O
remaining O
sum O

This O
matter O
arranged O
, O
George S-PERSON
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
held O
a O
council O
of O
war O
over O
their O
cigars O
, O
and O
agreed O
that O
a O
general O

be O
made O
for O

Jos S-PERSON
, O
I O
think O
, O
would O
have O
preferred O
staying O
until O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
quitted O
Brighton S-GPE
, O
but O
Dobbin S-PERSON
and O
George S-PERSON
overruled O
him O
, O
and O
he O
agreed O
to O
carry O
the O
party O
to O
town O
, O
and O
ordered O
four S-CARDINAL
horses O
, O
as O
became O
his O
dignity O
. O
With O
these O
they O
set O
off O
in O
state O
, O
after O
breakfast O
, O
the B-DATE

Amelia S-PERSON
had O
risen O
very O
early B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
and O
packed O
her O
little O
trunks O
with O
the O
greatest O
alacrity O
, O
while O
Osborne S-PERSON
lay O
in O
bed O
deploring O
that O
she O
had O
not O
a O
maid O
to O
help O
her O
. O
She O
was O
only O
too O
glad O
, O
however O
, O
to O
perform O
this O
office O
for O
herself O
. O
A O
dim O
uneasy O
sentiment O
about O
Rebecca S-PERSON
filled O
her O
mind O
already O

and O
although O
they O
kissed O
each O
other O
most O
tenderly O
at O
parting O
, O
yet O
we O
know O
what O
jealousy O
is O

and O
Mrs. O
Amelia S-PERSON
possessed O
that O
among O
other O
virtues O
of O
her O
sex O
. O
Besides O
these O
characters O
who O
are O
coming O
and O
going O
away O
, O
we O
must O
remember O
that O
there O
were O
some O
other O
old O
friends O
of O
ours O
at O
Brighton S-GPE

Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O

, O
and O
the O
suite O

Now O
, O
although O
Rebecca S-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
were O
but O
at O
a O
few O
stones’ O
throw O
of O
the O
lodgings O
which O
the O
invalid O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
occupied O
, O
the O
old O
lady’s O
door O
remained O
as O
pitilessly O
closed O
to O
them O
as O
it O
had O
been O
heretofore O
in O
London S-GPE

As O
long O
as O
she O
remained O
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
took O
care O
that O
her O
beloved O
Matilda S-PERSON
should O
not O
be O
agitated O
by O
a O
meeting O
with O
her O
nephew O
. O
When O
the O
spinster O
took O
her O
drive O
, O
the O
faithful O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
sate O
beside O
her O
in O
the O
carriage O
. O
When O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
took O
the O
air O
in O
a O
chair O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
marched O
on O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
of O
the O
vehicle O
, O
whilst O
honest O
Briggs S-PERSON
occupied O
the O
other O
wing O
. O
And O
if O
they O
met O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
by O
chance O
— O
although O
the O
former O
constantly O
and O
obsequiously O
took O
off O
his O
hat O
, O
the O
Miss B-ORG
- I-ORG
Crawley I-ORG
party E-ORG
passed O
him O
by O
with O
such O
a O
frigid O
and O
killing O
indifference O
, O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON
began O
to O
despair O
. O
“ O
We O
might O
as O
well O
be O
in O
London S-GPE
as O
here O
, O
” O
Captain O
Rawdon S-PERSON
often O
said O
, O
with O
a O
downcast O
air O
. O
“ O
A O
comfortable O
inn O
in O
Brighton S-GPE
is O
better O
than O
a O
spunging O
- O
house O
in O
Chancery B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
, O
” O
his O
wife O
answered O
, O
who O
was O
of O
a O
more O
cheerful O
temperament O
. O
“ O
Think O
of O
those O
two S-CARDINAL
aides O
- O
de O
- O
camp O
of O
Mr. O
Moses S-PERSON
, O
the O
sheriff’s O
officer O

who O
watched O
our O
lodging O
for O
a B-DATE
week E-DATE
. O
Our O
friends O
here O
are O
very O
stupid O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
Captain O
Cupid S-PERSON
are O
better O
companions O
than O
Mr. O
Moses’s S-PERSON
men O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
my O
love O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
wonder O
the O
writs O
haven’t O
followed O
me O
down O
here O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
continued O
, O
still O
desponding O
. O
“ O
When O
they O
do O
, O
we’ll O
find O
means O
to O
give O
them O
the O
slip O
, O
” O
said O
dauntless O
little O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
and O
further O
pointed O
out O
to O
her O
husband O
the O
great O
comfort O
and O
advantage O
of O
meeting O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
whose O
acquaintance O
had O
brought O
to O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
a O
most O
timely O
little O
supply O
of O
ready O
money O
. O
“ O
It O
will O
hardly O
be O
enough O
to O
pay O
the O
inn O
bill O
, O
” O
grumbled O
the O
Guardsman S-ORG
. O
“ O
Why O
need O
we O
pay O
it O
? O
” O
said O
the O
lady O
, O
who O
had O
an O
answer O
for O
everything O
. O
Through O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
valet O
, O
who O
still O
kept O
up O
a O
trifling O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
male O
inhabitants O
of O
Miss B-LOC
Crawley’s E-LOC
servants’ O
hall O
, O
and O
was O
instructed O
to O
treat O
the O
coachman O
to O
drink O
whenever O
they O
met O
, O
old O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
movements O
were O
pretty O
well O
known O
by O
our O
young O
couple O
| | O
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
luckily O
bethought O
herself O
of O
being O
unwell O
, O
and O
of O
calling O
in O
the O
same O
apothecary O
who O
was O
in O
attendance O
upon O
the O
spinster O
, O
so O
that O
their O
information O
was O
on O
the O
whole O
tolerably O
complete O
. O
Nor O
was O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
although O
forced O
to O
adopt O
a O
hostile O
attitude O
, O
secretly O
inimical O
to O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
. O
She O
was O
naturally O
of O
a O
kindly O
and O
forgiving O
disposition O
. O
Now O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
jealousy O
was O
removed O
, O
her O
dislike O
for O
Rebecca S-PERSON
disappeared O
also O
, O
and O
she O
remembered O
the O
latter’s O
invariable O
good O
words O
and O
good O
humour O
. O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
and O
Mrs. O
Firkin S-PERSON
, O
the O
lady’s O
- O
maid O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
of O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
household O
, O
groaned O
under O
the O
tyranny O
of O
the O
triumphant O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
. O
As O
often O
will O
be O
the O
case O
, O
that O
good O
but O
imperious O
woman O
pushed O
her O
advantages O
too O
far O
, O
and O
her O
successes O
quite O
unmercifully O
. O
She O
had O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
brought O
the O
invalid O
to O
such O
a O
state O
of O
helpless O
docility O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
soul O
yielded O
herself O
entirely O
to O
her O
sister’s O
orders O
, O
and O
did O
not O
even O
dare O
to O
complain O
of O
her O
slavery O
to O
Briggs S-PERSON
or O
Firkin S-ORG
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
measured O
out O
the O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
daily O
allowed O
to O
take O
, O
with O
irresistible O
accuracy O
, O
greatly O
to O
the O
annoyance O
of O
Frikin S-PERSON
and O
the O
butler O
, O
who O
found O
themselves O
deprived O
of O
control O
over O
even O
the O
sherry O
- O
bottle O
. O
She O
apportioned O
the O
sweet O
- O
breads O
, O
jellies O
, O
chickens O
| | O
their O
quantity O
and O
order O
. O
Night O
and O
noon B-TIME
and I-TIME
morning E-TIME
she O
brought O
the O
abominable O
drinks O
ordained O
by O
the O
Doctor O
, O
and O
made O
her O
patient O
swallow O
them O
with O
so O
affecting O
an O
obedience O
, O
that O
Firkin S-PERSON
said O
“ O
my O
poor O
Missus O
du O
take O
her O
physic O
like O
a O
lamb O
. O
” O
She O
prescribed O
the O
drive O
in O
the O
carriage O
or O
the O
ride O
in O
the O
chair O
, O
and O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
ground O
down O
the O
old O
lady O
in O
her O
convalescence O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
only O
belongs O
to O
your O
proper O
- O
managing O
, O
motherly O
moral O
woman O
. O
If O
ever O
the O
patient O
faintly O
resisted O
, O
and O
pleaded O
for O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
dinner O
or O
a O
little O
drop O
less O
medicine O
, O
the O
nurse O
threatened O
her O
with O
instantaneous O
death O
, O
when O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
instantly O
gave O
in O
. O
“ O
She’s O
no O
spirit O
left O
in O
her O
, O
” O
Firkin S-PERSON
remarked O
to O
Briggs S-PERSON

“ O
she O
aint O

called O
me O
a O
fool O
these B-DATE
three I-DATE

” O
Finally O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
had O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
dismiss O
the O
aforesaid O
honest O

previous O
to O
removing O
the O
dear O

bodily O
to O
Queen’s B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
when O
an O
odious O
accident O
happened O

called O
her O
away O

The O
Reverend O
Bute B-PERSON

Fever O

Mrs. O

was O
forced O
to O
leave O
Sussex S-GPE

As O
soon O
as O
ever O
Bute S-PERSON

restored O

she O
promised O
to O
return O
to O
her O

departed O

leaving O
the O
strongest O
injunctions O
with O
the O

and O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
got O
into O
the O
Southampton S-GPE

there O
was O
such O
a O
jubilee O

relief O
in O
all O
Miss O

That O

Mrs. O

: O
that O
night O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON

Miss O

indulged O
in O
a O
game O
of O
piquet O
instead O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Porteus’s S-PERSON
sermons O
. O
It O
was O
as O
in O
the O
old O
nursery O
- O
story O
, O
when O
the O
stick O
forgot O
to O
beat O
the O

and O
the O
whole O
course O

At O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
early I-TIME
hour I-TIME

the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
twice O

thrice O
a O
week O

Miss O

used O

betake O

to O
a O

and O
disport O
in O

an O

Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
was O
aware O
of O
this O
circumstance O
, O
and O
though O
she O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
storm O
Briggs S-PERSON
as O
she O
had O
threatened O
, O
and O
actually O
dive O
into O
that O
lady’s O
presence O
and O
surprise O
her O
under O
the O
sacredness O
of O
the O
awning O
, O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
determined O
to O
attack O
Briggs S-PERSON
as O
she O
came O
away O
from O
her O
bath O
, O
refreshed O
and O
invigorated O
by O
her O
dip O
, O
and O
likely O
to O
be O
in O
good O
humour O
. O
So O
getting O
up O
very O
early O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
Becky S-PERSON
brought O
the O

in O
their O

which O
faced O
the O

to O
bear O
upon O
the O

on O
the O
beach O

saw O
Briggs S-PERSON
arrive O
, O
enter O
her O
box O
, O
and O
put O
out O
to O
sea O

and O
was O
on O
the O
shore O
just O
as O
the O
nymph O
of O
whom O
she O
came O
in O
quest O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
little O
caravan O
on O

the O

It O
was O
a O
pretty O
picture O

the O
bathing O
- O
women’s O
faces O

the O
long O
line O
of O
rocks O

buildings O
were O
blushing O
and O
bright O
in O
the O
sunshine O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
wore O
a O
kind O
, O
tender O
smile O
on O
her O
face O
, O
and O
was O
holding O
out O
her O
pretty O
white O
hand O
as O
Briggs S-PERSON
emerged O
from O
the O
box O
. O
What O
could O
Briggs S-PERSON
do O
but O
accept O
the O
salutation O
? O
“ O
Miss O
Sh O

Mrs. O

Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
seized O
her O

pressed O
it O
to O
her O

with O
a O

kissed O
her O
affectionately O

“ O
Dear O
, O
dear O
friend O

” O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
such O
natural O
feeling O
, O
that O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
of O
course O
at O
once O
began O
to O
melt O

even O
the O

mollified O

Rebecca S-PERSON
found O
no O

Briggs S-PERSON

a O
long O

About O

their O
doctors O
do O
ladies O
ever O
tire O
of O
talking O

Briggs S-PERSON
did O
not O
on O
this O
occasion O

nor O
did O
Rebecca S-PERSON
weary O
of O
listening O
. O
She O
was O
thankful O
, O
truly O
thankful O
, O
that O
the O
dear O
kind O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
that O

Heaven O

she O

Rebecca S-PERSON

had O
seemed O
to O
act O
undutifully O
towards O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON

yet O
was O
not O
her O
fault O
a O
natural O
and O
excusable O
one O
? O
Could O
she O
help O
giving O
her O
hand O
to O
the O
man O
who O
had O
won O
her O
heart O
? O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
the O
sentimental O
, O
could O
only O
turn O
up O
her O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
at O
this O
appeal O
, O
and O
heave O
a O
sympathetic O
sigh O
, O
and O
think O
that O

too O
, O
had O
given O
away O
her O

long O
years B-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
and O
own O
that O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
no O
very O
great O
criminal O
. O
“ O
Can O
I O
ever O
forget O
her O
who O
so O
befriended O
the O
friendless O
orphan O

No O

though O
she O
has O
cast O
me O
off O

” O
the O
latter O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
shall O
never O
cease O
to O

her O

my O

as O
my O

Rawdon’s S-PERSON

, O
I O
love O

admire O
Miss O

, O
dear O
Miss O

, O
beyond O
any O
woman O
in O
the O

her O
I O

all O

her O

I O
would O
never O

treated O
Miss O

faithful O
friends O

that O
odious O
designing O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
has O
done O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
all O
heart O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
continued O
, O
“ O
although O
his O
outward O
manners O
might O
seem O
rough O
and O
careless O
, O
had O
said O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
times O
, O
with O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
that O
he O
blessed O
Heaven O
for O
sending O
his O
dearest O
Aunty O
two S-CARDINAL
such O
admirable O
nurses O
as O
her O
attached O
Firkin S-PERSON
and O
her O
admirable O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
Should O
the O
Machinations O
of O
the O
horrible O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
end O
, O
as O
she O
too O
much O
feared O
they O
would O
, O
in O
banishing O
everybody O
that O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
loved O
from O
her O
side O
, O
and O
leaving O
that O
poor O
lady O
a O
victim O
to O
those O
harpies O
at O
the O
Rectory O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
besought O
her O
( O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
) O
to O
remember O
that O
her O
own O
home O
, O
humble O
as O
it O
was O
, O
was O
always O
open O
to O
receive O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
Dear O
friend O
, O
” O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
transport O
of O
enthusiasm O
, O
“ O
some O
hearts O
can O
never O
forget O
benefits O

all O

are O
not O
Bute O
Crawleys O
! O
Though O
why O
should O
I O
complain O
of O
her O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
added O
| | O
“ O
though O
I O
have O
been O
her O
tool O
and O
the O
victim O
to O
her O
arts O
, O
do O
I O
not O
owe O
my O
dearest O
Rawdon S-PERSON
to O
her O
? O
” O
And O
Rebecca S-PERSON
unfolded O
to O
Briggs S-PERSON
all O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
conduct O
at O
Queen’s B-FAC
Crawley E-FAC
, O
which O
, O
though O
unintelligible O
to O
her O
then O
, O
was O
clearly O
enough O
explained O
by O
the O
events O
now O
, O
— O
now O
that O
the O
attachment O
had O
sprung O
up O
which O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
had O
encouraged O
by O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
artifices O
, O
— O
now O
that O
two S-CARDINAL
innocent O
people O
had O
fallen O
into O
the O
snares O
which O
she O
had O
laid O
for O
them O
, O
and O
loved O
and O
married O
and O
been O
ruined O
through O
her O
schemes O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
true O
. O
Briggs S-PERSON
saw O
the O
stratagems O
as O
clearly O
as O
possible O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
had O
made O
the O
match O
between O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
Yet O
, O
though O
the O
latter O
was O
a O
perfectly O
innocent O
victim O
, O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
could O
not O
disguise O
from O
her O
friend O
her O
fear O
that O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
affections O
were O
hopelessly O
estranged O
from O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
would O
never O
forgive O
her O
nephew O
for O
making O
so O
imprudent O
a O
marriage O
. O
On O
this O
point O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
her O
own O
opinion O
, O
and O
still O
kept O
up O
a O
good O
heart O
. O
If O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
did O
not O
forgive O
them O
at O
present O
, O
she O
might O
at O
least O
relent O
on O
a B-DATE
future I-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
Even O
now O
, O
there O
was O
only O
that O
puling O
, O
sickly O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
between O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
a O
baronetcy O
| | O
and O
should O
anything O
happen O
to O
the O
former O
, O
all O
would O
be O
well O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
to O
have O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
designs O
exposed O
, O
and O
herself O
well O
abused O
, O
was O
a O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
might O
be O
advantageous O
to O
Rawdon’s S-NORP
interests O
| | O
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
after O
an O
hour’s O
chat O
with O
her O
recovered O
friend O
, O
left O
her O
with O
the O
most O
tender O
demonstrations O
of O
regard O
, O
and O
quite O
assured O
that O
the O
conversation O
they O
had O
had O
together O
would O
be O
reported O
to O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
before O
many B-TIME
hours E-TIME
were O
over O
. O
This O
interview O
ended O
, O
it O
became O
full O
time O
for O
Rebecca S-PERSON
to O
return O
to O
her O
inn O
, O
where O
all O
the O
party O
of O
the B-DATE
previous I-DATE
day E-DATE
were O
assembled O
at O
a O
farewell O
breakfast O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
took O
such O
a O
tender O
leave O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
as O
became O
two S-CARDINAL
women O
who O
loved O
each O
other O
as O
sister O
| | O
and O
having O
used O
her O
handkerchief O
plentifully O
, O
and O
hung O
on O
her O
friend’s O
neck O
as O
if O
they O
were O
parting O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
waved O
the O
handkerchief O
( O
which O
was O
quite O
dry O
, O
by O
the O
way O
) O
out O
of O
window O
, O
as O
the O
carriage O
drove O
off O
, O
she O
came O
back O
to O
the O
breakfast O
table O
, O
and O
ate O
some O
prawns O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
appetite O
, O
considering O
her O
emotion O
| | O
and O
while O
she O
was O
munching O
these O
delicacies O
, O
explained O
to O
Rawdon S-PERSON
what O
had O
occurred O
in O
her O
morning O
walk O
between O
herself O
and O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
Her O
hopes O
were O
very O
high O
: O
she O
made O
her O
husband O
share O
them O
. O
She O
generally O
succeeded O
in O
making O
her O
husband O
share O
all O
her O
opinions O
, O
whether O
melancholy O
or O
cheerful O
. O
“ O
You O
will O
now O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
writing O
- O
table O
and O
pen O
me O
a O
pretty O
little O
letter O
to O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
in O
which O
you O
say O
that O
you O
are O
a O
good O
boy O
, O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O
” O
So O
Rawdon S-PERSON
sate O
down O
, O
and O
wrote O
off O
, O
“ O
Brighton S-GPE
, O
Thursday S-DATE
, O
” O
and O
“ O
My O
dear O
Aunt O
, O
” O
with O
great O
rapidity O
: O
but O
there O
the O
gallant O
officer’s O
imagination O
failed O
him O
. O
He O
mumbled O
the O
end O
of O
his O
pen O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
in O
his O
wife’s O
face O
. O
She O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
at O
his O
rueful O
countenance O
, O
and O
marching O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
with O
her O
hands O
behind O
her O
, O
the O
little O
woman O
began O
to O
dictate O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
he O
took O
down O
. O
“ O
Before O
quitting O
the O
country O
and O
commencing O
a O
campaign O
, O
which O
very O
possibly O
may O
be O
fatal O
, O
” O
“ O
What O
? O
” O
said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
rather O
surprised O
, O
but O
took O
the O
humour O
of O
the O
phrase O
, O
and O
presently O
wrote O
it O
down O
with O
a O
grin O
. O
“ O
Which O
very O
possibly O
may O
be O
fatal O
, O
I O
have O
come O
hither O
— O
” O
“ O
Why O
not O
say O
come O
here O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
? O
come O
here’s O
grammar O
, O
” O
the O
dragoon O
interposed O
. O
“ O
I O
have O
come O
hither O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
insisted O
, O
with O
a O
stamp O
of O
her O
foot O
, O
“ O
to O
say O
farewell O
to O
my O
dearest O
and O
earliest O
friend O
. O
I O
beseech O
you O
before O
I O
go O
, O
not O
perhaps O
to O
return O
, O
once O
more O
to O
let O
me O
press O
the O
hand O
from O
which O
I O
have O
received O
nothing O
but O
kindnesses O
all O
my O
life O
. O
” O
“ O
Kindnesses O
all O
my O
life O
, O
” O
echoed O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
scratching O
down O
the O
words O
, O
and O
quite O
amazed O
at O
his O
own O
facility O
of O
composition O
. O
“ O
I O
ask O
nothing O
from O
you O
but O
that O
we O
should O
part O
not O
in O
anger O
. O
I O
have O
the O
pride O
of O
my O
family O
on O
some O
points O
, O
though O
not O
on O
all O
. O
I O
married O
a O
painter’s O
daughter O
, O
and O
am O
not O
ashamed O
of O
the O
union O
. O
” O
“ O
No O
, O
run O
me O
through O
the O
body O
if O
I O
am O
! O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
ejaculated O
. O
“ O
You O
old O
booby O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
pinching O
his O
ear O
and O
looking O
over O
to O
see O
that O
he O
made O
no O
mistakes O
in O
spelling O
— O
“ O
beseech O
is O
not O
spelt O
with O
an O
a O
, O
and O
earliest O
is O
. O
” O
So O
he O
altered O
these O
words O
, O
bowing O
to O
the O
superior O
knowledge O
of O
his O
little O
Missis S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
thought O
that O
you O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
progress O
of O
my O
attachment O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
continued O
: O
“ O
I O
knew O
that O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
confirmed O
and O
encouraged O
it O
. O
But O
I O
make O
no O
reproaches O
. O
I O
married O
a O
poor O
woman O
, O
and O
am O
content O
to O
abide O
by O
what O
I O
have O
done O
. O
Leave O
your O
property O
, O
dear O
Aunt S-PERSON
, O
as O
you O
will O
. O
I O
shall O
never O
complain O
of O
the O
way O
in O
which O
you O
dispose O
of O
it O

I O
would O

I O
cannot O

of O
farewell O

” O
“ O
She O
won’t O
recognise O
my O
style O
in O
that O
, O
” O
said O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
have O
made O
the O
sentences O
short O
and O
brisk O
on O
purpose O

” O
And O
this O
authentic O
missive O
was O
despatched O
under O
cover O
to O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
Old O
Miss B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
laughed O
when O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
with O
great O
mystery O
, O
handed O
her O
over O
this O
candid O
and O
simple O
statement O
. O
“ O
We O
may O
read O
it O
now O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
is O
away O
, O

she O
said O
. O
“ O
Read O
it O
to O
me O
, O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
” O
When O
Briggs S-PERSON
had O
read O
the O
epistle O
out O
, O
her O
patroness O
laughed O
more O
. O
“ O
Don’t O
you O
see O
, O
you O
goose O
, O
” O
she O
said O
to O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
who O
professed O
to O
be O
much O
touched O
by O
the O
honest O
affection O
which O
pervaded O
the O
composition O
, O
“ O
Don’t S-PERSON
you O
see O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON
never O
wrote O
a O
word O
of O
it O
. O
He O
never O
wrote O
to O
me O
without O
asking O
for O
money O
in O
his O
life O
, O
and O
all O
his O
letters O
are O
full O
of O
bad O
spelling O
, O
and O
dashes O
and O
bad O
grammar O
. O
It O
is O
that O
little O
serpent O
of O
a O
governess O
who O
rules O
him O
. O
” O
They O
are O
all O
alike O
, O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
thought O
in O
her O
heart O
. O
They O
all O
want O
me O
dead O
, O
and O
are O
hankering O
for O
my O
money O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
mind O
seeing O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
added O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
perfect O
indifference O
. O
“ O
I O
had O
just O
as O
soon O
shake O
hands O
with O
him O
as O
not O

Provided O
there O
is O
no O
scene O

why O
shouldn’t O
we O
meet O
? O
I O
don’t O
mind O

But O
human O
patience O
has O
its O
limits O

and O
mind O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
respectfully O
decline O
to O
receive O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
— O
I O
can’t O
support O
that O
quite O
” O
— O
and O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
fain O
to O
be O
content O
with O
this O
half O
- O
message O
of O
conciliation O
| | O
and O
thought O
that O
the O
best O
method O
of O
bringing O
the O
old O
lady O
and O
her O
nephew O
together O
, O
was O
to O
warn O
Rawdon S-PERSON
to O
be O
in O
waiting O
on O
the O
Cliff S-PERSON
, O
when O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
went O
out O
for O
her O
air O
in O
her O
chair O
. O
There O
they O
met O
. O
I O
don’t O
know O
whether O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
any O
private O
feeling O
of O
regard O
or O
emotion O
upon O
seeing O
her O
old O
favourite O

but O
she O
held O
out O
a O
couple O
of O
fingers O
to O
him O
with O
as O
smiling O
and O
good O
- O
humoured O
an O
air O
, O
as O
if O
they O
had O
met O
only O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
And O
as O
for O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
he O
turned O
as O
red O
as O
scarlet O
, O
and O
wrung O
off O
Briggs’s O
hand O
, O
so O
great O
was O
his O
rapture O
and O
his O
confusion O
at O
the O
meeting O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
interest O
that O
moved O
him O
: O
or O
perhaps O
affection O
: O
perhaps O
he O
was O
touched O
by O
the O
change O
which O
the O
illness O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
had O
wrought O
in O
his O
aunt O
. O
“ O
The O
old O
girl O
has O
always O
acted O
like O
a O
trump O
to O
me O
, O
” O
he O
said O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
as O
he O
narrated O
the O
interview O
, O
“ O
and O
I O
felt O
, O
you O
know O
, O
rather O
queer O
, O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O
I O
walked O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
what O

dy’e O

call O

’em O
, O
you O
know O

to O
her O
own O
door O
, O
where O
Bowls O
came O
to O
help O
her O
in O
. O
And O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
in O
very O
much O
. O
only O
— O
” O
“ O
You O
didn’t O
go O
in O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
! O
” O
screamed O
his O
wife O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
my O
dear O

I’m O
hanged O
if O
I O
wasn’t O
afraid O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
point O
. O
” O
“ O
You O
fool O
! O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
gone O
in O
, O
and O
never O
come O
out O
again O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
Don’t S-PERSON
call O
me O
names O
, O
” O
said O
the O
big O
Guardsman O
, O
sulkily O
. O
“ O
Perhaps O
I O
was O
a O
fool O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
but O
you O
shouldn’t O
say O
so O

” O
and O
he O
gave O
his O
wife O
a O
look O
, O
such O
as O
his O
countenance O
could O
wear O
when O
angered O
, O
and O
such O
as O
was O
not O
pleasant O
to O
face O

“ O
Well O

dearest O
, O
to O

you O
must O
be O
on O
the O
look O

out O

go O

see O
her O
, O
mind O
, O
whether O
she O
asks O
you O

no O

” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
trying O
to O
soothe O
her O
angry O
yoke O
- O
mate O
. O
On O
which O
he O
replied O
, O
that O
he O
would O
do O
exactly O
as O
he O
liked O
, O
and O
would O
just O
thank O
her O
to O
keep O
a O
civil O
tongue O
in O
her O
head O
— O
and O
the O
wounded O
husband O
went O
away O
, O
and O
passed O
the O
forenoon O
at O
the O
billiard O
- O
room O
, O
sulky O
, O
silent O
, O
and O
suspicious O
. O
But O
before O
the O
night O
was O
over O

was O
compelled O
to O
give O
in O
, O
and O
own O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
to O
his O
wife’s O
superior O
prudence O
and O
foresight O
, O
by O
the O
most O
melancholy O
confirmation O
of O
the O
presentiments O
which O
she O
had O
regarding O
the O
consequences O
of O
the O
mistake O
which O
he O
had O
made O
. O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
must O
have O
had O
some O
emotion O
upon O
seeing O
him O
and O
shaking O
hands O
with O
him O
after O
so O
long O
a O
rupture O

She O
mused O
upon O
the O
meeting O
a O
considerable O
time O
. O
“ O
Rawdon S-PERSON
is O
getting O
very O
fat O
and O
old O

Briggs S-PERSON
, O

she O
said O
to O
her O
companion O
. O
“ O
His O
nose O
has O
become O
red O

he O
is O
exceedingly O
coarse O

His O
marriage O
to O
that O
woman O

hopelessly O
vulgarised O
him O

drank O
together O

no O
doubt O

smelt O
of O

abominably O

remarked O
it O

you O

vain O
Briggs S-PERSON
interposed O

ill O

when O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
asleep O
in O
the O
great O
chair O

But O
, O
in O
vain O
he O
cried O
out O
against O
the O
enormity O
of O
turtle O

champagne O
that O
was O
fit O
for O

quite O
pleased O
with O
himself O

Nor O
did O
Dobbin S-PERSON
try O

convince O
him O
that O
Amelia’s S-NORP

was O
not O
centred O
in O
turtle O

A O
while O
after O
dinner O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
timidly O
expressed O
a O
wish O

see O
her O
mamma O
, O
at O
Fulham S-ORG
: O

permission O
George S-PERSON
granted O

she O
tripped O
away O

still O
drinking O

get O
her O

go O

And O
the O
coach O
being O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
hotel O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
made O
George S-PERSON
a O
little O
disappointed O
curtsey O
after O
looking O
vainly O
into O
his O
face O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
and O
went O
sadly O
down O

Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
after O

handed O
her O
into O
the O

and O
saw O
it O
drive O
away O
to O
its O
destination O
. O
The O
very O
valet O
was O
ashamed O
of O
mentioning O
the O

the O
hackney O

coachman O
before O
the O
hotel O

further O

Dobbin S-PERSON
walked O
home O
to O
his O
old O
quarters O
at O
the O
Slaughters’ S-FAC
thinking O
very O
likely O
that O
it O
would O
be O
delightful O
to O
be O
in O
that O
hackney O

coach O
, O
along O
with O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON

George S-PERSON

evidently O

he O
had O
taken O

to O
see O
Mr. O

Captain O

had O
himself O
performed O
high O

comedy O

with O
great O
distinction O
in O
several O

Jos S-PERSON
slept O
on O

long O

woke O
up O

Mrs. O

, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O

clasped O
her O

all O
maternal O
eagerness O

affection O
, O
running O
out O

up O

days E-DATE
past O
since O
Amelia S-PERSON
had O
left O
that O
little O
cottage O
and O
home O
— O
and O
yet O
how O
far O
off O
the O
time O
seemed O
since O
she O
had O
bidden O
it O
farewell O
. O
What O
a O
gulf O
lay O
between O
her O
and O
that O
past O
life O
. O
She O
could O
look O
back O
to O
it O
from O
her O
present O
standing O
- O
place O
, O
and O
contemplate O
, O
almost O
as O
another O
being O
, O
the O
young O
unmarried O
girl O
absorbed O
in O
her O
love O
, O
having O
no O
eyes O
but O
for O
one S-CARDINAL
special O
object O
, O
receiving O
parental O
affection O
if O
not O
ungratefully O
, O
at O
least O
indifferently O
, O
and O
as O
if O
it O
were O
her O
due O
— O
her O
whole O
heart O
and O
thoughts O
bent O
on O
the O
accomplishment O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
desire O
. O
To O
review O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
so O
lately O
gone O
yet O
so O
far O
away O
, O
touched O
her O
with O
shame O
| | O
and O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
kind O
parents O
filled O
her O
with O
tender O
remorse O
. O
Was O
the O
prize O
gained O
— O
the O
heaven O
of O
life O
— O
and O
the O
winner O
still O
doubtful O
and O
unsatisfied O
? O
As O
his O
hero O
and O
heroine O
pass O
the O
matrimonial O
barrier O
, O
the O
novelist O
generally O
drops O
the O
curtain O
, O
as O
if O
the O
drama O
were O
over O
then O
: O
the O
doubts O
and O
struggles O
of O
life O
ended O
: O
as O
if O
, O
once O
landed O
in O
the O
marriage O
country O
, O
all O
were O
green O
and O
pleasant O
there O
: O
and O
wife O
and O
husband O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
to O
link O
each O
other’s O
arms O
together O
, O
and O
wander O
gently O
downwards O
towards O
old O
age O
in O
happy O
and O
perfect O
fruition O
. O
But O
our O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
just O
on O
the O
bank O
of O
her O
new O
country O
, O
and O
was O
already O
looking O
anxiously O
back O
towards O
the O
sad O
friendly O
figures O
waving O
farewell O
to O
her O
across O
the O
stream O
, O
from O
the O
other O
distant O
shore O
. O
In O
honour O
of O
the O
young O
bride’s O
arrival O
, O
her O
mother O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
prepare O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
festive O
entertainment O
, O
and O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
ebullition O
of O
talk O
, O
took O
leave O
of O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
dived O
down O
to O
the O
lower O
regions O
of O
the O
house O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
kitchen O
- O
parlour O
( O
occupied O
by O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Clapp S-PERSON
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
her O
dishes O
were O
washed O
and O
her O
curl O
- O
papers O
removed O
, O
by O
Miss O
Flannigan S-PERSON
, O
the O
Irish S-NORP
servant O
) O
, O
there O
to O
take O
measures O
for O
the O
preparing O
of O
a O
magnificent O
ornamented O
tea O
. O
All O
people O
have O
their O
ways O
of O
expressing O
kindness O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
that O
a O
muffin O
and O
a O
quantity O
of O
orange O
marmalade O
spread O
out O
in O
a O
little O
cut O
-glass O
saucer O
would O
be O
peculiarly O
agreeable O
refreshments O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
in O
her O
most O
interesting O
situation O
. O
While O
these O
delicacies O
were O
being O
transacted O
below O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
leaving O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
walked O
up O
stairs O
and O
found O
herself O
, O
she O
scarce O
knew O
how O
, O
in O
the O
little O
room O
which O
she O
had O
occupied O
before O
her O
marriage O
, O
and O
in O
that O
very O
chair O
in O
which O
she O
had O
passed O
so O
many O
bitter O
hours O
. O
She O
sank O
back O
in O
its O
arms O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
old O
friend O
| | O
and O
fell O
to O
thinking O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
and O
the O
life O
beyond O
it O
. O
Already O
to O
be O
looking O
sadly O
and O
vaguely O
back O
: O
always O
to O
be O
pining O
for O
something O
which O
, O
when O
obtained O
, O
brought O
doubt O
and O
sadness O
rather O
than O
pleasure O
| | O
here O
was O
the O
lot O
of O
our O
poor O
little O
creature O
, O
and O
harmless O
lost O
wanderer O
in O
the O
great O
struggling O
crowds O
of O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
. O
Here O
she O
sate O
, O
and O
recalled O
to O
herself O
fondly O
that O
image O
of O
George S-PERSON
to O
which O
she O
had O
knelt O
before O
marriage O
. O
Did O
she O
own O
to O
herself O
how O
different O
the O
real O
man O
was O
from O
that O
superb O
young O
hero O
whom O
she O
had O
worshipped O
? O
It O
requires O
many O
, O
many O
years O
— O
and O
a O
man O
must O
be O
very O
bad O
indeed O
— O
before O
a O
woman’s O
pride O
and O
vanity O
will O
let O
her O
own O
to O
such O
a O
confession O
. O
Then O
Rebecca’s O
twinkling O
green O
eyes O
and O
baleful O
smile O
lighted O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
filled O
her O
with O
dismay O
. O
And O
so O
she O
sate O
for O
awhile O
indulging O
in O
her O
usual O
mood O
of O
selfish O
brooding O
, O
in O
that O
very O
listless O
melancholy O
attitude O
in O
which O
the O
honest O
maid O
- O
servant O
had O
found O
her O
, O
on O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
when O
she O
brought O
up O
the O
letter O
in O
which O
George S-PERSON
renewed O
his O
offer O
of O
marriage O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
the O
little O
white O
bed O
, O
which O
had O
been O
hers O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
and O
thought O
she O
would O
like O
to O
sleep O
in O
it O
that O
night O
, O
and O
wake O
, O
as O
formerly O
, O
with O
her O
mother O
smiling O
over O
her O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
Then O
she O
thought O
with O
terror O
of O
the O
great O
funereal O
damask O
pavilion O
in O
the O
vast O
and O
dingy O
state O
bed- O
room O
, O
which O
was O
awaiting O
her O
at O
the O
grand O
hotel O
in O
Cavendish B-FAC
Square E-FAC
. O
Dear O
little O
white O
bed O
! O
how O
many O
a O
long O
night O
had O
she O
wept O
on O
its O
pillow O
! O
How O
she O
had O
despaired O
and O
hoped O
to O
die O
there O
| | O
and O
now O
were O
not O
all O
her O
wishes O
accomplished O
, O
and O
the O
lover O
of O
whom O
she O
had O
despaired O
her O
own O
for O
ever O
? O
Kind O
mother O
! O
how O
patiently O
and O
tenderly O
she O
had O
watched O
round O
that O
bed O
! O
She O
went O
and O
knelt O
down O
by O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
| | O
and O
there O
this O
wounded O
and O
timorous O
, O
but O
gentle O
and O
loving O
soul O
, O
sought O
for O
consolation O
where O
as O
yet O
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
, O
our O
little O
girl O
had O
but O
seldom O
looked O
for O
it O
. O
Love O
had O
been O
her O
faith O
hitherto O
| | O
and O
the O
sad O
, O
bleeding O
disappointed O
heart O
began O
to O
feel O
the O
want O
of O
another O
consoler O
. O
Have O
we O
a O
right O
to O
repeat O
or O
to O
overhear O
her O
prayers O
? O
These O
, O
brother O
, O
are O
secrets O
, O
and O
out O
of O
the O
domain O
of O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
, O
in O
which O
our O
story O
lies O
. O
But O
this O
may O
be O
said O
, O
that O
when O
the O
tea O
was O
finally O
announced O
, O
our O
young O
lady O
came O
downstairs O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
cheerful O
| | O
that O
she O
did O
not O
despond O
, O
or O
deplore O
her O
fate O
, O
or O
think O
about O
George’s S-PERSON
coldness O
, O
or O
Rebecca’s O
eyes O
, O
as O
she O
had O
been O
wont O
to O
do O
of O
late O
. O
She O
went O
downstairs O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
father O
and O
mother O
, O
and O
talked O
to O
the O
old O
gentleman O
, O
and O
made O
him O
more O
merry O
than O
he O
had O
been O
for O
many O
a O
day O
. O
She O
sate O
down O
at O
the O
piano O
which O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
bought O
for O
her O
, O
and O
sang O
over O
all O
her O
father’s O
favourite O
old O
songs O
. O
She O
pronounced O
the O
tea O
to O
be O
excellent O
, O
and O
praised O
the O
exquisite O
taste O
in O
which O
the O
marmalade O
was O
arranged O
in O
the O
saucers O
. O
And O
in O
determining O
to O
make O
everybody O
else O
happy O
, O
she O
found O
herself O
so O
| | O
and O
was O
sound O
asleep O
in O
the O
great O
funereal O
pavilion O
, O
and O
only O
woke O
up O
with O
a O
smile O
when O
George S-PERSON
arrived O
from O
the O
theatre O
. O
For O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
George S-PERSON
had O
more O
important O
“ O
business O
” O
to O
transact O
than O
that O
which O
took O
him O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Kean S-PERSON
in O
Shylock S-PERSON
. O
Immediately O
on O
his O
arrival O
in O
London S-GPE
he O
had O
written O
off O
to O
his O
father’s O
solicitors O
, O
signifying O
his O
royal O
pleasure O
that O
an O
interview O
should O
take O
place O
between O
them O
on O
the O
morrow O
. O
His O
hotel O
bill O
, O
losses O
at O
billiards O
and O
cards O
to O
Captain B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
had O
almost O
drained O
the O
young O
man’s O
purse O
, O
which O
wanted O
replenishing O
before O
he O
set O
out O
on O
his O
travels O
, O
and O
he O
had O
no O
resource O
but O
to O
infringe O
upon O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
which O
the O
attorneys O
were O
commissioned O
to O
pay O
over O
to O
him O
. O
He O
had O
a O
perfect O
belief O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
that O
his O
father O
would O
relent O
before O
very O
long O
. O
How O
could O
any O
parent O
be O
obdurate O
for O
a O
length O
of O
time O
against O
such O
a O
paragon O
as O
he O
was O
? O
If O
his O
mere O
past O
and O
personal O
merits O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
mollifying O
his O
father O
, O
George S-PERSON
determined O
that O
he O
would O
distinguish O
himself O
so O
prodigiously O
in O
the O
ensuing O
campaign O
that O
the O
old O
gentleman O
must O
give O
in O
to O
him O
. O
And O
if O
not O
? O
Bah O
! O
the O
world O
was O
before O
him O
. O
His O
luck O
might O
change O
at O
cards O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
deal O
of O
spending O
in O
two B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
. O
So O
he O
sent O
off O
Amelia S-PERSON
once O
more O
in O
a O
carriage O
to O
her O
mamma O
, O
with O
strict O
orders O
and O
carte O

to O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

They O
had O
but O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
to O
complete O
the O
outfit O
, O
and O
it O
may O
be O
imagined O
that O
their O
business O
therefore O
occupied O
them O
pretty O
fully O
. O
In O
a O
carriage O
once O
more O

bustling O
about O
from O

escorted O
back O

the O
carriage O
by O
obsequious O
shopmen O

polite O

, O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
was O
herself O
again O
almost O
, O
and O
sincerely O
happy O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O

pretty O

( O
Would O
any O

the O
most O
philosophic O

give O
twopence O
for O
a O
woman O

She O
gave O
herself O
a O
little O
treat O
, O
obedient O
to O
her O
husband’s O
orders O

and O
purchased O
a O
quantity O
of O

showing O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
taste O

elegant O
discernment O
, O
as O
all O
the O
shopfolks O
said O

And O
about O
the O
war O
that O
was O
ensuing O
, O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
not O
much O
alarmed O

Bonaparty S-PERSON

stalked O

He O
ordered O
somebody O
to O
inform O
Mr. O
Higgs S-PERSON
that O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
waiting O

in O

the O
Captain’s O

He O
did O
not O
see O
the O
sneer O
of O
contempt O
which O
passed O
all O
round O
the O

from O
the O

The O

Perhaps O
George S-PERSON
expected O
, O
when O
he O
entered O
Mr. O
Higg’s S-PERSON
apartment O
, O
to O
find O
that O
gentleman O
commissioned O

give O
him O
some O
message O
of O
compromise O
or O
conciliation O
from O
his O
father O

perhaps O
his O
haughty O
and O
cold O
demeanour O
was O
adopted O
as O
a O
sign O
of O
his O
spirit O
and O
resolution O

but O
if O
so O
, O
his O
fierceness O
was O
met O
by O
a O
chilling O
coolness O
and O
indifference O
on O
the O
attorney’s O
part O
, O
that O
rendered O
swaggering O
absurd O
. O
He O
pretended O
to O
be O
writing O
at O
a O
paper O
, O
when O
the O
Captain O
entered O
. O
“ O

asked O

out O

“ O

quite O
proud O

able O

claim O
such O
an O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
the O
stout O
civilian O
hailed O
him O
with O
a O
cordiality O
very O
different O
from O
the O
reception O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
vouchsafed O
to O
his O
friend O
in O
Brighton S-GPE

Dobbin S-PERSON
liked O
him O
for O

As O

stepped O
forward O
to O

the O

Stubble S-PERSON

came O
tripping O
down O

He O
blushed O
profusely O

Dobbin S-PERSON
took O
most O
kindly O
to O
Mr. O

from O
that B-DATE

and O
encouraged O
him O
to O
talk O

their O
private O
walks O
, O

at O

Her O
simple O
artless O
behaviour O

modest O
kindness O

won O
all O

rose O
immensely O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
youth O

by O
his O
gallantry O

quite O
angry O

as O
for O
Mrs. O
Kirk S-PERSON
: O
that O
disciple O

forth O

replies O
that O
she O

Mrs. O

begged O
Amelia S-PERSON

But O
all O
the O
men O

good O
fellows O

they O
were O
, O
rallied O
round O
their O
comrade’s O
pretty O
wife O
, O
and O
paid O
her O
their O
court O
with O
soldierly O
gallantry O
. O
She O
had O
a O
little O
triumph O
, O
which O
flushed O
her O
spirits O
and O
made O
her O
eyes O
sparkle O
. O
George S-PERSON
was O
proud O
of O
her O
popularity O
, O
and O
pleased O
with O
the O
manner O
( O
which O
was O
very O
gay O

graceful O

though O
naive O

a O
little O
timid O
) O
with O
which O
she O
received O
the O
gentlemen’s O
attentions O
, O

answered O
their O
compliments O
. O
And O
he O
in O
his O
uniform O
— O
how O
much O
handsomer O
he O
was O
than O
any O
man O
in O
the O
room O
! O
She O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
affectionately O
watching O
her O

glowed O
with O
pleasure O
at O
his O
kindness O

“ O
I O
will O
make O
all O
his O

she O
resolved O
in O
her O
heart O

“ O
I O

her O
with O
acclamation O

Captains O

made O
one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

being O
professional O

need O

Cackle S-PERSON

the O
Assistant O

Edinburgh S-GPE
, O
condescended O
to O
examine O
her O
upon O
leeterature O
, O
and O
tried O
her O
with O
his O
three S-CARDINAL
best O
French S-NORP
quotations O
. O
Young B-PERSON
Stubble E-PERSON
went O
about O

whispering O
, O
“ O
Jove S-PERSON
, O
isn’t O
she O

As O
for O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
he O
never O
so O
much O
as O
spoke O
to O
her O

But O
he O

Captain B-PERSON

took O
home O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
the O
hotel O

who O
was O
in O
a O
very O
maudlin O
state O

had O
told O
his O
tiger O
- O
hunt O
story O
with O
great O
effect O
, O
both O
at O
the O

Dobbin S-PERSON
loitered O
about O
, O
smoking O
his O
cigar O
before O
the O
inn O
door O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
meanwhile O
very O
carefully O
shawled O
his O
wife O

and O
brought O
her O
away O
from O
Mrs. O

a O
general O
handshaking O
from O
the O
young O
officers O

who O
accompanied O
her O
to O
the O

cheered O
that O
vehicle O
as O
it O
drove O
off O

So O
Amelia S-PERSON
gave O
Dobbin S-PERSON
her O
little O
hand O
as O
she O
got O
out O
of O
the O
carriage O

rebuked O
him O
smilingly O
for O
not O
having O
taken O
any O
notice O

her O
all O
night O

came O
very O
suddenly O

on O
the B-DATE

so O
alarmed O
Mr. O

that O
he O
was O
on O
the O

Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON

made O
himself O
immensely O
officious O
in O

, O
Jos S-PERSON
said O
) O
, O
rated O
him O

laughed O
at O
him O
soundly O
: O
the O
mustachios O
were O
grown O
in O

Jos S-PERSON
finally O
was O
persuaded O

London S-GPE

could O
only O

English S-LANGUAGE

Dobbin S-PERSON
procured O
for O
Jos’s B-ORG
party E-ORG
a O
swarthy O
little O
Belgian S-NORP
servant O
who O
could O
speak O
no O

who O
, O
by O
his O

by O
invariably O
addressing O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
as O
“ O
My O
lord O
, O
” O
speedily O
acquired O
that O
gentleman’s O
favour O
. O
Times O
are O
altered O
at O
Ostend S-GPE
now O

of O
the O
Britons S-NORP
who O
go O
thither O
, O
very O
few O
look O
like O
lords O
, O
or O
act O
like O
those O
members O
of O
our O
hereditary O

They O
seem O
for O
the O
most O

shabby O
in O
attire O

dingy O
of O

lovers O
of O
billiards O

cigars O
and O
greasy O
ordinaries O
. O
But O
it O
may O
be O
said O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
that O
every O
Englishman S-NORP
in O
the B-ORG
Duke I-ORG
of I-ORG
Wellington’s E-ORG
army O
paid O
his O
way O
. O
The O
remembrance O
of O
such O
a O
fact O
surely O
becomes O
a O
nation O
of O
shopkeepers O
. O
It O
was O
a O
blessing O
for O
a O
commerce O
- O
loving O
country O
to O
be O
overrun O
by O
such O
an O
army O
of O
customers O

and O
to O
have O
such O
creditable O
warriors O
to O
feed O
. O
And O
the O
country O
which O
they O
came O
to O
protect O
is O
not O
military O
. O
For O
a O
long O
period O
of O
history O
they O
have O
let O
other O
people O
fight O
there O
. O
When O
the O

went O
to O
survey O
with O
eagle O
glance O
the O
field O
of O
Water O

asked O

whether O
he O
had O
been O
at O
the O

. O
“ O
Pas O

” O
— O
such O
an O
answer O
and O
sentiment O
as O
no O
Frenchman S-NORP
would O
own O
to O
— O
was O
his O
reply O
. O
But O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
postilion O
who O
drove O
us O
was O
a O
Viscount S-PERSON

a O
son O
of O
some O

Imperial B-ORG
General E-ORG
, O
who O
accepted O
a O
pennyworth O
of O

on O

The O
moral O
is O
surely O
a O
good O
one O
. O
This O
flat O
, O
flourishing O
, O
easy O
country O
never O
could O
have O
looked O
more O
rich O

in O
that O

1815 S-DATE

all O

remember O

the O

the O

his O

But O
this O
vulgarity O
of O

none O

which O
her O

mistook O
for O
delicacy O
on O

Thus O
Mrs. O

a O

with O

the O
Major’s S-PERSON

gave O
excruciating O

when O
his O

not O

The O

Crawley S-PERSON
told O

her O
— O
a O
flame O
of O
yours O
? O
O O
, O
you O
wicked O
man O
! O
And O
there O
is O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
eating O
ice O
, O
I O
declare O
: O
how O
he O
seems O
to O
enjoy O
it O
! O
General O
, O
why O
have O
we O
not O
had O
any O
ices O
? O
” O
“ O
Shall O
I O
go O
and O
fetch O
you O
some O
? O
” O
said O
the O
General O
bursting O
with O
wrath O
. O
“ O
Let O
me O
go O
, O
I O
entreat O
you O
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Amelia’s O
box O
. O
Dear O
, O
sweet O
girl O
! O
Give O
me O
your O
arm O
, O
Captain O
George S-PERSON
| | O
” O
and O
so O
saying O
, O
and O
with O
a O
nod O
to O
the O
General O
, O
she O
tripped O
into O
the O
lobby O
. O
She O
gave O
George S-PERSON
the O
queerest O
knowingest O
look O
, O
when O
they O
were O
together O
, O
a O
look O
which O
might O
have O
been O
interpreted O
, O
“ O
Don’t O
you O
see O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
and O
what O
a O
fool O
I’m O
making O
of O
him O
? O
” O
But O
he O
did O
not O
perceive O
it O
. O
He O
was O
thinking O
of O
his O
own O
plans O
, O
and O
lost O
in O
pompous O
admiration O
of O
his O
own O
irresistible O
powers O
of O
pleasing O
. O
The O
curses O
to O
which O
the O
General O
gave O
a O
low O
utterance O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
Rebecca S-PERSON
and O
her O
conqueror O
had O
quitted O
him O
, O
were O
so O
deep O
, O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
no O
compositor O
would O
venture O
to O
print O
them O
were O
they O
written O
down O
. O
They O
came O
from O
the O
General’s O
heart O
| | O
and O
a O
wonderful O
thing O
it O
is O
to O
think O
that O
the O
human O
heart O
is O
capable O
of O
generating O
such O
produce O
, O
and O
can O
throw O
out O
, O
as O
occasion O
demands O
, O
such O
a O
supply O
of O
lust O
and O
fury O
, O
rage O
and O
hatred O
. O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
gentle O
eyes O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
fixed O
anxiously O
on O
the O
pair O
, O
whose O
conduct O
had O
so O
chafed O
the O
jealous O
General O
| | O
but O
when O
Rebecca S-PERSON
entered O
her O
box O
, O
she O
flew O
to O
her O
friend O
with O
an O
affectionate O
rapture O
which O
showed O
itself O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
publicity O
of O
the O
place O
| | O
for O
she O
embraced O
her O
dearest O
friend O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
whole O
house O
, O
at O
least O
in O
full O
view O
of O
the O
General’s O
glass O
, O
now O
brought O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
Osborne S-PERSON
party O
. O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
saluted O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
with O
the O
kindliest O
greetin O
she O
admired O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd’s S-PERSON
large O
Cairngorm O
brooch O
and O
superb O
Irish S-NORP
diamonds O
, O
and O
wouldn’t O
believe O
that O
they O
were O
not O
from O
Golconda S-GPE
direct O
. O
She O
bustled O
, O
she O
chattered O
, O
she O
turned O
and O
twisted O
, O
and O
smiled O
upon O
one O
, O
and O
smirked O
on O
another O
, O
all O
in O
full O
view O
of O
the O
jealous O
opera O
- O
glass O
opposite O
. O
And O
when O
the O
time O
for O
the O
ballet O
came O
( O
in O
which O
there O
was O
no O
dancer O
that O
went O
through O
her O
grimaces O
or O
performed O
her O
comedy O
of O
action O
better O
) O
, O
she O
skipped O
back O
to O
her O
own O
box O
, O
leaning O
on O
Captain O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
arm O
this O
time O
. O
No O
, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
George’s S-PERSON
: O
he O
must O
stay O
and O
talk O
to O
his O
dearest O
, O
best O
, O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
“ O
What O
a O
humbug O
that O
woman O
is O
! O
” O
honest O
old O
Dobbin S-PERSON
mumbled O
to O
George S-PERSON
, O
when O
he O
came O
back O
from O
Rebecca’s S-GPE
box O
, O
whither O
he O
had O
conducted O
her O
in O
perfect O
silence O
, O
and O
with O
a O
countenance O
as O
glum O
as O
an O
undertaker’s O
. O
“ O
She O
writhes O
and O
twists O
about O
like O
a O
snake O
. O
All O
the O
time O
she O
was O
here O
, O
didn’t O
you O
see O
, O
George S-PERSON
, O
how O
she O
was O
acting O
at O
the O
General O
over O
the O
way O
? O
” O
“ O
Humbug O

it O
, O
she’s O
the O
nicest O
little O
woman O
in O
England S-GPE
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
replied O
, O
showing O
his O
white O
teeth O
, O
and O
giving O
his O
ambrosial O
whiskers O
a O
twirl O
. O
“ O
You O

Dammy S-PERSON
, O
look O
at O
her O
now O
, O
she’s O
talked O
over O
Tufto S-PERSON
in O
no O
time O
. O

how O
he’s O
laughing O
! O
Gad S-PERSON
, O
what O

you O

“ O
Faith O

then O
, O
why O
didn’t O
you O
boy O
one O

” O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
said O

and O
both O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
thanked O
her O
for O
this O
timely O
observation O
. O
But O
beyond O
this O
neither O
of O
the O
ladies O
rallied O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
overpowered O
by O
the O
flash O
and O
the O
dazzle O
and O
the O
fashionable O
talk O
of O
her O
worldly O
rival O
. O
Even O
the O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
was O
silent O
and O
subdued O
after O
Becky’s S-PERSON
brilliant O
apparition O
, O
and O
scarcely O
said O
a O
word O
more O
about O
Glenmalony S-PERSON
all O
the O
evening O
. O
“ O
When O

Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
friend O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
the O
night O
at O
the O

“ O

do O
you O
intend O

up O

was O
the O
other’s O
reply O
. O
“ O
What O
the O
deuce O

man O

are O
you O
alarmed O

“ O

I O
don’t O
think O
he O
could O
pay O
if O
he O
lost O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
| | O
and O
his O
advice O
met O
with O
the O
success O
which O
advice O
usually O
commands O
. O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
Crawley S-PERSON
were O
repeatedly O
together O
now O
. O
General O
Tufto S-PERSON
dined O
abroad O
almost O
constantly O
. O
George S-PERSON
was O
always O
welcome O
in O
the O
apartments O
( O
very O
close O
indeed O
to O
those O
of O
the O
General O
) O
which O
the O
Aide B-FAC
- I-FAC
de- I-FAC
camp E-FAC
and O
his O
wife O
occupied O
in O
the O
hotel O
. O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
manners O
were O
such O
when O
she O
and O
George S-PERSON
visited O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
at O
these O
quarters O
, O
that O
they O
had O
very O
nearly O
come O
to O
their O
first S-ORDINAL
quarrel O

that O
is O
, O
George S-PERSON
scolded O
his O
wife O
violently O
for O
her O
evident O
unwillingness O
to O
go O
, O
and O
the O
high O
and O
mighty O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
comported O
herself O
towards O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
her O
old O
friend O

and O
Amelia S-PERSON
did O
not O
say O
one S-CARDINAL
single O
word O
in O
reply O

but O
with O
her O
husband’s O
eye O
upon O
her O
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
scanning O
her O
, O
as O
she O
felt O
, O
was O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
more O
bashful O
and O
awkward O
on O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
visit O
which O
she O
paid O
to O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
than O
on O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
call O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
doubly O
affectionate O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
would O
not O
take O
notice O
, O
in O
the O
least O
, O
of O
her O
friend’s O
coolness O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
Emmy O
has O
become O
prouder O
since O
her O
father’s O
name O
was O
in O
the O
— O
, O
since O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
misfortunes O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
softening O
the O
phrase O
charitably O
for O
George’s S-PERSON
ear O
. O
“ O
Upon O
my O
word O

I O
thought O

was O
doing O
me O
the O
honour O

be O
jealous O

now O

is O
scandalised O

Rawdon S-PERSON

I O

the O
General O

together O

could O
we O

with O
our O

for O
a O

do O
you O
suppose O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON
is O
not O
big O
enough O
to O
take O
care O
of O
my O
honour O

I’m O
very O
much O
obliged O

Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O

“ O
Pooh S-PERSON

jealousy O

answered O
George S-PERSON
, O
“ O
all O

jealous O

“ O

Crawley’s S-PERSON

with O
a O
pert O
toss O

her O
head O

George S-PERSON
accepted O

not O

him O

merely O
became O

pined O
over O

carrying O
on O
a O
desperate O
flirtation O
with O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
. O
He O
rode O
with O
her O
whenever O
she O
was O
free O
. O
He O
pretended O
regimental O
business O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
( O
by O
which O
falsehood O
she O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
deceived O
) O
, O
and O
consigning O
his O
wife O
to O
solitude O
or O
her O
brother’s O
society O
, O
passed O
his O
evenings O
in O
the O
Crawleys’ S-ORG
company O
| | O
losing O
money O
to O
the O
husband O
and O
flattering O
himself O
that O
the O
wife O
was O
dying O
of O
love O
for O
him O
. O
It O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
this O
worthy O
couple O
never O
absolutely O
conspired O
and O
agreed O
together O
in O
so O
many O
words O
: O
the O
one O
to O
cajole O
the O
young O
gentleman O
, O
whilst O
the O
other O
won O
his O
money O
at O
cards O

but O
they O
understood O
each O
other O
perfectly O
well O
, O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
let O
Osborne S-PERSON
come O
and O
go O
with O
entire O
good O
humour O
. O
George S-PERSON
was O
so O
occupied O
with O
his O
new O
acquaintances O
that O
he O
and O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
were O
by O
no O
means O
so O
much O
together O
as O
formerly O
. O
George S-PERSON
avoided O
him O
in O
public O
and O
in O
the O
regiment O
, O
and O
as O
we O
see O
, O
did O
not O
like O
those O
sermons O
which O
his O
senior O
was O
disposed O
to O
inflict O
upon O
him O
. O
If O
some O
parts O
of O
his O
conduct O
made O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
exceedingly O
grave O
and O
cool O

of O
what O
use O
was O
it O
to O
tell O
George S-PERSON
that O
, O
though O
his O
whiskers O
were O
large O
, O
and O
his O
own O
opinion O
of O
his O
knowingness O
great O
, O
he O
was O
as O
green O
as O
a O
school O
- O
boy O
? O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
making O
a O
victim O
of O
him O
as O
he O
had O
done O
of O
many O
before O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
used O
him O
would O
fling O
him O
off O
with O
scorn O
? O
He O
would O
not O
listen O
: O
and O
so O
, O
as O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
upon O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
when O
he O
visited O
the O
Osborne S-PERSON
house O
, O
seldom O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
meeting O
his O
old O
friend O
, O
much O
painful O
and O
unavailing O
talk O
between O
them O
was O
spared O

Our O

All O

in O

state O
of O
excitement O

heard O
from O

much O
greater O

The O
struggles O

such O

panting O
to O

strove O
in O
vain O

others O

off O

dinner O
at O

a O
card O

one B-DATE

to O
Mrs. O

displayed O
a O
similar O
invitation O

made O
Jos S-PERSON
envious O

and O
George S-PERSON
wonder O
how O
the O
deuce O
he O
should O
be O
getting O
into O
society O
. O
Mr. O

having O
commanded O
new O
dresses O
and O
ornaments O
of O
all O
sorts O
for O
Amelia S-PERSON

drove O
to O
the O
famous O
ball O
, O
where O
his O
wife O
did O
not O
know O
a O
single O
soul O

After O
looking O
about O
for O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres E-PERSON
, O
who O
cut O
him O
, O
thinking O
the O
card O
was O
quite O
enough O
— O
and O
after O
placing O
Amelia S-PERSON
on O
a O
bench O
he O
left O
her O
to O
her O
own O
cogitations O
there O
, O
thinking O
, O
on O
his O
own O
part O

that O

behaved O
very O
handsomely O
in O

Her O
thoughts O
were O
not O

and O
nobody O
except O
honest O
Dobbin S-PERSON
came O
to O
disturb O
them O
. O
Whilst O
her O
appearance O
was O
an O
utter O
failure O
( O
as O
her O
husband O
felt O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
rage O
, O
) O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
Crawley’s S-PERSON
début O
was O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
very O
brilliant O
. O
She O
arrived O
very O
late O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
radiant O

her O
dress O
perfection O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
great O
persons O
assembled O
, O
and O
the O
eye O
- O
glasses O
directed O
to O
her O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
seemed O
to O
be O
as O
cool O
and O
collected O
as O
when O
she O
used O
to O
marshal O
Miss O
Pinkerton’s S-PERSON
little O
girls O
to O
church O
. O
Numbers O
of O
the O
men O
she O
knew O
already O
, O
and O
the O
dandies O
thronged O
round O
her O
. O
As O
for O
the O
ladies O
, O
it O
was O
whispered O
among O
them O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
run O
away O
with O
her O
from O
out O
of O
a O
convent O
, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
a O
relation O
of O
the O
Montmorency S-PERSON
family O
. O
She O
spoke O
French S-LANGUAGE
so O
perfectly O
that O
there O
might O
be O
some O
truth O
in O
this O
report O
, O
and O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
her O
manners O
were O
fine O
, O
and O
her O
air O
distingué O
. O
Fifty S-CARDINAL
would O
- O
be O
partners O
thronged O
round O
her O
at O
once O
, O
and O
pressed O
to O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
dance O
with O
her O
. O
But O
she O
said O
she O
was O
engaged O
, O
and O
only O
going O
to O
dance O
very O
little O
| | O
and O
made O
her O
way O
at O
once O
to O
the O
place O
where O
Emmy O
sat O
quite O
unnoticed O
, O
and O
dismally O
unhappy O
. O
And O
so O
, O
to O
finish O
the O
poor O
child O
at O
once O
, O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
ran O
and O
greeted O
affectionately O
her O
dearest O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
and O
began O
forthwith O
to O
patronise O
her O
. O
She O
found O
fault O
with O
her O
friend’s O
dress O
, O
and O
her O
hair O
- O
dresser O
, O
and O
wondered O
how O
she O
could O
be O
so O
chaussée O
, O
and O
vowed O
that O
she O
must O
send O
her O
corsetidère O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
. O
She O
vowed O
that O
it O
was O
a O
delightful O
ball O
| | O
that O
there O
was O
everybody O
that O
every O
one O
knew O
, O
and O
only O
a O
very O
few O
nobodies O
in O
the O
whole O
room O
. O
It O
is O
a O
fact O
, O
that O
in O
a B-DATE
fortnight E-DATE
, O
and O
after O
three S-CARDINAL
dinners O
in O
general O
society O
, O
this O
young O
woman O
had O
got O
up O
the O
genteel O
jargon O
so O
well O
, O
that O
a O
native O
could O
not O
speak O
it O
better O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
only O
from O
her O
French S-NORP
being O
so O
good O
, O
that O
you O
could O
know O
she O
was O
not O
a O
born O
woman O
of O
fashion O
. O
George S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
left O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
on O
her O
bench O
on O
entering O
the O
ballroom O
, O
very O
soon O
found O
his O
way O
back O
when O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
by O
her O
dear O
friend’s O
side O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
just O
lecturing O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
upon O
the O
follies O
which O
her O
husband O
was O
committing O
. O
“ O
For O
God’s O
sake O
, O
stop O
him O
from O
gambling O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
or O
he O
will O
ruin O
himself O
. O
He O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
are O
playing O
at O
cards O
every O
night O
, O
and O
you O
know O
he O
is O
very O
poor O
, O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
will O
win O
every O
shilling O
from O
him O
if O
he O
does O
not O
take O
care O
. O
Why O
don’t O
you O
prevent O
him O
, O
you O
little O
careless O
creature O
? O
Why O
don’t O
you O
come O
to O
us O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
instead O
of O
moping O
at O
home O
with O
that O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
is O
très O
aimable O
| | O
how O
could O
one O
love O
a O
man O
with O
feet O
of O
such O
size O
? O
Your O
husband’s O
feet O
are O
darlings O
- O
Here O
he O
comes O
. O
Where O
have O
you O
been O
, O
wretch O
? O
Here O
is O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
crying O
her O
eyes O
out O
for O
you O
. O
Are O
you O
coming O
to O
fetch O
me O
for O
the O
quadrille O
? O
” O
And O
she O
left O
her O
bouquet O
and O
shawl O
by O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
side O
, O
and O
tripped O
off O
with O
George S-PERSON
to O
dance O
. O
Women O
only O
know O
how O
to O
wound O
so O
. O
There O
is O
a O
poison O
on O
the O
tips O
of O
their O
little O
shafts O
, O
which O
stings O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
more O
than O
a O
man’s O
blunter O
weapon O
. O
Our O
poor O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
who O
had O
never O
hated O
, O
never O
sneered O
all O
her O
life O
, O
was O
powerless O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
her O
remorseless O
little O
enemy O
. O
George S-PERSON
danced O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
twice O
or O
thrice O
— O
how O
many O
times O
Amelia S-PERSON
scarcely O
knew O
. O
She O
sat O
quite O
unnoticed O
in O
her O
corner O
, O
except O
when O
Rawdon S-PERSON
came O
up O
with O
some O
words O
of O
clumsy O
conversation O
: O
and O
later O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
made O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
bring O
her O
refreshments O
and O
sit O
beside O
her O
. O
He O
did O
not O
like O
to O
ask O
her O
why O
she O
was O
so O
sad O
| | O
but O
as O
a O
pretext O
for O
the O
tears O
which O
were O
filling O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
she O
told O
him O
that O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
alarmed O
her O
by O
telling O
her O
that O
George S-PERSON
would O
go O
on O
playing O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
curious O
, O
when O
a O
man O
is O
bent O
upon O
play O
, O
by O
what O
clumsy O
rogues O
he O
will O
allow O
himself O
to O
be O
cheated O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
| | O
and O
Emmy S-PERSON
said O
, O
“ O
Indeed O
. O
” O
She O
was O
thinking O
of O
something O
else O
. O
It O
was O
not O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
money O
that O
grieved O
her O
. O
At O
last O
George S-PERSON
came O
back O
for O
Rebecca’s O
shawl O
and O
flowers O
. O
She O
was O
going O
away O

She O
did O
not O
even O
condescend O
to O
come O
back O
and O
say O
good O
- O
bye O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
The O
poor O
girl O
let O
her O
husband O
come O
and O
go O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
and O
her O
head O
fell O
on O
her O
breast O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
been O
called O
away O
and O
was O
whispering O
deep O
in O
conversation O
with O
the O
General O
of O
the O
division O
, O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
had O
not O
seen O
this O
last O
parting O
. O
George S-PERSON
went O
away O
then O
with O
the O
bouquet O
| | O
but O
when O
he O
gave O
it O
to O
the O
owner O
, O
there O
lay O
a O
note O
, O
coiled O
like O
a O
snake O
among O
the O
flowers O
. O
Rebecca’s O
eye O
caught O
it O
at O
once O
. O
She O
had O
been O
used O
to O
deal O
with O
notes O
in O
early O
life O
. O
She O
put O
out O
her O
hand O
and O
took O
the O
nosegay O
. O
He O
saw O
by O
her O
eyes O
as O
they O
met O
, O
that O
she O
was O
aware O
what O
she O
should O
find O
there O
. O
Her O
husband O
hurried O
her O
away O
, O
still O
too O
intent O
upon O
his O
own O
thoughts O
, O
seemingly O
, O
to O
take O
note O
of O
any O
marks O
of O
recognition O
which O
might O
pass O
between O
his O
friend O
and O
his O
wife O
. O
These O
were O
, O
however O
, O
but O
trifling O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
gave O
George S-PERSON
her O
hand O
with O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
her O
usual O
quick O
knowing O
glances O
, O
and O
made O
a O
curtsey O
and O
walked O
away O
. O
George S-PERSON
bowed O
over O
the O
hand O
, O
said O
nothing O
in O
reply O
to O
a O
remark O
of O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
, O
did O
not O
hear O
it O
even O
, O
his O
brain O
was O
so O
throbbing O
with O
triumph O
and O
excitement O
, O
and O
allowed O
them O
to O
go O
away O
without O
a O
word O
. O
His O
wife O
saw O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
part O
at O
least O
of O
the O
bouquet O
- O
scene O
. O
It O
was O
quite O
natural O
that O
George S-PERSON
should O
come O
at O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
request O
to O
get O
her O
her O
scarf O
and O
flowers O
: O
it O
was O
no O
more O
than O
he O
had O
done O
twenty S-CARDINAL
times O
before O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
| | O
but O
now O
it O
was O
too O
much O
for O
her O
. O
“ O
William S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
suddenly O
clinging O
to O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
near O
her O
, O
“ O
you’ve O
always O
been O
very O
kind O
to O
me O
— O
I’m O
— O
I’m O
not O
well O
. O
Take O
me O
home O
. O
” O
She O
did O
not O
know O
she O
called O
him O
by O
his O
Christian S-NORP
name O
, O
as O
George S-PERSON
was O
accustomed O
to O
do O
. O
He O
went O
away O
with O
her O
quickly O
. O
Her O
lodgings O
were O
hard O
by O
| | O
and O
they O
threaded O
through O
the O
crowd O
without O
, O
where O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
more O
astir O
than O
even O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
within O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
been O
angry O
twice O
or O
thrice O
at O
finding O
his O
wife O
up O
on O
his O
return O
from O
the O
parties O
which O
he O
frequented O
: O
so O
she O
went O
straight O
to O
bed O
now O
| | O
but O
although O
she O
did O
not O
sleep O
, O
and O
although O
the O
din O
and O
clatter O
, O
and O
the O
galloping O
of O
horsemen O
were O
incessant O
, O
she O
never O
heard O
any O
of O
these O
noises O
, O
having O
quite O
other O
disturbances O
to O
keep O
her O
awake O
. O
Osborne S-PERSON
meanwhile O
, O
wild O
with O
elation O
, O
went O
off O
to O
a O
playtable O
, O
and O
began O
to O
bet O
frantically O
. O
He O
won O
repeatedly O
. O
“ O
Everything O
succeeds O
with O
me O
to O
- O
night O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
But O
his O
luck O
at O
play O
even O
did O
not O
cure O
him O
of O
his O
restlessness O
, O
and O
he O
started O
up O
after O
awhile O
, O
pocketing O
his O
winnings O
, O
and O
went O
to O
a O
buffet O
, O
where O
he O
drank O
off O
many O
bumpers O
of O
wine O
. O
Here O
, O
as O
he O
was O
rattling O
away O
to O
the O
people O
around O
, O
laughing O
loudly O
and O
wild O
with O
spirits O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
found O
him O
. O
He O
had O
been O
to O
the O
card O
- O
tables O
to O
look O
there O
for O
his O
friend O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
looked O
as O
pale O
and O
grave O
as O
his O
comrade O
was O
flushed O
and O
jovial O
. O
“ O
Hullo S-PERSON
, O
Dob O
! O
Come O
and O
drink O
, O
old O
Dob O
! O
The O
Duke’s S-PRODUCT
wine O
is O
famous O
. O
Give O
me O
some O
more O
, O
you O
sir O

” O
and O
he O
held O
out O
a O
trembling O
glass O
for O
the O
liquor O
. O
“ O
Come O
out O
, O
George S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
still O
gravely O

“ O
don’t O
drink O
. O
” O
“ O
Drink O
! O
there’s O
nothing O
like O
it O

Drink O
yourself O

light O
up O
your O

jaws O
, O
old O
boy O

Here’s O
to O
you O
. O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
went O
up O
and O
whispered O
something O
to O
him O
, O
at O
which O
George S-PERSON
, O
giving O
a O
start O
and O
a O
wild O
hurray O
, O
tossed O
off O
his O
glass O
, O
clapped O
it O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
walked O
away O
speedily O
on O
his O
friend’s O
arm O
. O
“ O
The O
enemy O
has O
passed O
the O
Sambre S-LOC
, O
” O
William S-PERSON
said O
, O
“ O
and O
our O
left O
is O
already O
engaged O
. O
Come O
away O
. O
We O
are O
to O
march O
in O
three B-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O
” O
Away O
went O
George S-PERSON
, O
his O
nerves O
quivering O
with O
excitement O
at O
the O
news O
so O
long O
looked O
for O
, O
so O
sudden O
when O
it O
came O
. O
What O
were O
love O
and O
intrigue O
now O
? O
He O
thought O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
things O
but O
these O
in O
his O
rapid O
walk O
to O
his O
quarters O
— O
his O
past O
life O
and O
future O
chances O
— O
the O
fate O
which O
might O
be O
before O
him O
— O
the O
wife O
, O
the O
child O
perhaps O
, O
from O
whom O
unseen O
he O
might O
be O
about O
to O
part O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
he O
wished O
that O
night’s O
work O
undone O
! O
and O
that O
with O
a O
clear O
conscience O
at O
least O
he O
might O
say O
farewell O
to O
the O
tender O
and O
guileless O
being O
by O
whose O
love O
he O
had O
set O
such O
little O
store O
! O
He O
thought O
over O
his O
brief O
married O
life O
. O
In O
those B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
he O
had O
frightfully O
dissipated O
his O
little O
capital O
. O
How O
wild O
and O
reckless O
he O
had O
been O
! O
Should O
any O
mischance O
befall O
him O
: O
what O
was O
then O
left O
for O
her O
? O
How O
unworthy O
he O
was O
of O
her O
. O
Why O
had O
he O
married O
her O
? O
He O
was O
not O
fit O
for O
marriage O
. O
Why O
had O
he O
disobeyed O
his O
father O
, O
who O
had O
been O
always O
so O
generous O
to O
him O
? O
Hope O
, O
remorse O
, O
ambition O
, O
tenderness O
, O
and O
selfish O
regret O
filled O
his O
heart O
. O
He O
sat O
down O
and O
wrote O
to O
his O
father O
, O
remembering O
what O
he O
had O
said O
once O
before O
, O
when O
he O
was O
engaged O
to O
fight O
a O
duel O
. O
Dawn S-PERSON
faintly O
streaked O
the O
sky O
as O
he O
closed O
this O
farewell O
letter O
. O
He O
sealed O
it O
, O
and O
kissed O
the O
superscription O
. O
He O
thought O
how O
he O
had O
deserted O
that O
generous O
father O
, O
and O
of O
the O
thousand S-CARDINAL
kindnesses O
which O
the O
stern O
old O
man O
had O
done O
him O
. O
He O
had O
looked O
into O
Amelia’s O
bed-room O
when O
he O
entered O
| | O
she O
lay O
quiet O
, O
and O
her O
eyes O
seemed O
closed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
glad O
that O
she O
was O
asleep O
. O
On O
arriving O
at O
his O
quarters O
from O
the O
ball O
, O
he O
had O
found O
his O
regimental O
servant O
already O
making O
preparations O
for O
his O
departure O
: O
the O
man O
had O
understood O
his O
signal O
to O
be O
still O
, O
and O
these O
arrangements O
were O
very O
quickly O
and O
silently O
made O
. O
Should O
he O
go O
in O
and O
wake O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
he O
thought O
, O
or O
leave O
a O
note O
for O
her O
brother O
to O
break O
the O
news O
of O
departure O
to O
her O
? O
He O
went O
in O
to O
look O
at O
her O
once O
again O
. O
She O
had O
been O
awake O
when O
he O
first S-ORDINAL
entered O
her O
room O
, O
but O
had O
kept O
her O
eyes O
closed O
, O
so O
that O
even O
her O
wakefulness O
should O
not O
seem O
to O
reproach O
him O
. O
But O
when O
he O
had O
returned O
, O
so O
soon O
after O
herself O
, O
too O
, O
this O
timid O
little O
heart O
had O
felt O
more O
at O
ease O
, O
and O
turning O
towards O
him O
as O
he O
stepped O
softly O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
she O
had O
fallen O
into O
a O
light O
sleep O
. O
George S-PERSON
came O
in O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
again O
, O
entering O
still O
more O
softly O
. O
By O
the O
pale O
night O
- O
lamp O
he O
could O
see O
her O
sweet O
, O
pale O
face O
— O
the O
purple O
eyelids O
were O
fringed O
and O
closed O

one S-CARDINAL
round O
arm O
, O
smooth O
and O
white O
, O
lay O
outside O
of O
the O
coverlet O

Good O

how O
pure O

was O

how O
gentle O

how O
tender O

how O
friendless O

stood O
at O
the O
bed’s O
foot O

looked O
at O
the O
sleeping O
girl O

How O
dared O
he O
— O
who O
was O
he O
, O
to O
pray O
for O
one O
so O
spotless O
! O
God O

God O

her O

He O
came O
to O
the O
bed O

side O

and O
looked O
at O
the O
hand O
, O
the O
little O
soft O
hand O
, O
lying O
asleep O

and O
he O
bent O
over O
the O
pillow O
noiselessly O
towards O
the O
gentle O
pale O
face O
. O
Two S-CARDINAL
fair O
arms O
closed O
tenderly O
round O
his O
neck O

he O
stooped O
down O

“ O

the O
poor O

with O
a O
sob O

break O
the O
little O
heart O

nestled O
so O
closely O
by O
his O

At O

a O
bugle O
from O
the B-FAC

began O
sounding O

invited O
to O
the O
ball O
at O
which O
in O
our O
last O
chapter O
other O
of O
our O
friends O
figured O
, O
had O
much O
more O
time O
to O
take O
their O
wholesome O
natural O
rest O
in O
bed O
, O
than O
was O
accorded O
to O
people O
who O
wished O
to O
enjoy O
pleasure O
as O
well O
as O
to O
do O
duty O
. O
“ O
It’s O
my O
belief O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
as O
he O
placidly O
pulled O
his O
nightcap O
over O
his O
ears O
, O
“ O
that O
there O
will O
be O
such O
a O
ball O
danced O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two S-CARDINAL

some O
of O
’em O
has O
never O
heard O
the O
chune O
of O

” O
and O
he O
was O
much O
more O
happy O
to O
retire O
to O
rest O
after O
partaking O
of O
a O
quiet O
tumbler O
, O
than O
to O
figure O
at O
any O
other O
sort O
of O
amusement O
. O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
for O
her O
part O
, O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
shown O
her O
turban O
and O
bird O
of O
paradise O
at O
the O
ball O
, O
but O
for O
the O
information O
which O
her O
husband O
had O
given O
her O
, O
and O
which O
made O
her O
very O
grave O
. O
“ O
I’d O
like O
ye O
wake O
me O
about B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
the O
assembly O
beats O
, O
” O
the O
Major O
said O
to O
his O
lady O
. O
“ O
Call O
me O
at O
half O

Maybe O
I’ll O
not O
come O
back O
to O
breakfast O
, O
Mrs. O
O’D S-PERSON
. O
” O
With O
which O
words O
, O
which O
signified O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
regiment O
would O
march O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
the O
Major O
ceased O
talking O
, O
and O
fell O
asleep O
. O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
, O
the O
good O
housewife O
, O
arrayed O
in O
curl O
- O
papers O
and O
a O
camisole O
, O
felt O
that O
her O
duty O
was O
to O
act O
, O
and O
not O
to O
sleep O
, O
at O
this O
juncture O
. O
“ O
Time O
enough O
for O
that O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
when O
Mick’s S-PERSON
gone O

” O
and O
so O
she O
packed O
his O
travelling O
valise O
ready O
for O
the O
march O
, O
brushed O
his O
cloak O
, O
his O
cap O
, O
and O
other O
warlike O
habiliments O
, O
set O
them O
out O
in O
order O
for O
him O
| | O
and O
stowed O
away O
in O
the O
cloak O
pockets O
a O
light O
package O
of O
portable O
refreshments O
, O
and O
a O
wicker O
- O
covered O
flask O
or O
pocketpistol O
, O
containing O
near O
a O
pint O
of O
a O
remarkably O
sound O
Cognac O
brandy O
, O
of O
which O
she O
and O
the O
Major O
approved O
very O
much O

and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
“ O
repayther O
” O
pointed O
to O
half O
- O
past O
one O
, O
and O
its O
interior O
arrangements O
( O
it O
had O
a O
tone O
quite O
equal O
to O
a O
cathaydral O
, O
its O
fair O
owner O
considered O
) O
knelled O
forth O
that O
fatal O
hour O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
woke O
up O
her O
Major O
, O
and O
had O
as O
comfortable O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
prepared O
for O
him O
as O
any O
made O
that O
morning O
in O
Brussels S-GPE
. O
And O
who O
is O
there O
will O
deny O
that O
this O
worthy O
lady’s O
preparations O
betokened O
affection O
as O
much O
as O
the O
fits O
of O
tears O
and O
hysterics O
by O
which O
more O
sensitive O
females O
exhibited O
their O
love O
, O
and O
that O
their O
partaking O
of O
this O
coffee O
, O
which O
they O
drank O
together O
while O
the O
bugles O
were O
sounding O
the O
turn O
- O
out O
and O
the O
drums O
beating O
in O
the O
various O
quarters O
of O
the O
town O
, O
was O
not O
more O
useful O
and O
to O
the O
purpose O
than O
the O
outpouring O
of O
nay O
mere O
sentiment O
could O
be O
? O
The O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
the O
Major O
appeared O
on O
parade O
quite O
trim O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
alert O
— O
his O
well O
- O
shaved O
rosy O
countenance O
, O
as O
he O
sat O
on O
horseback O
, O
giving O
cheerfulness O
and O
confidence O
to O
the O
whole O
corps O
. O
All O
the O
officers O
saluted O
her O
when O
the O
regiment O
marched O
by O
the O
balcony O
on O
which O
this O
brave O
woman O
stood O
, O
and O
waved O
them O
a O
cheer O
as O
they O
passed O
| | O
and O
I O
daresay O
it O
was O
not O
from O
want O
of O
courage O
, O
but O
from O
a O
sense O
of O
female O
delicacy O
and O
propriety O
, O
that O
she O
refrained O
from O
leading O
the O
gallant O
— O
th O
personally O
into O
action O
. O
On O
Sundays S-DATE
, O
and O
at O
periods O
of O
a O
solemn O
nature O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
used O
to O
read O
with O
great O
gravity O
out O
of O
a O
large O
volume O
of O
her O
uncle O
the O
Dean’s S-PERSON
sermons O
. O
It O
had O
been O
of O
great O
comfort O
to O
her O
on O
board O
the O
transport O
as O
they O
were O
coming O
home O
, O
and O
were O
very O
nearly O
wrecked O
, O
on O
their O
return O
from O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Indies E-GPE
. O
After O
the O
regiment’s O
departure O
she O
betook O
herself O
to O
this O
volume O
for O
meditation O
| | O
perhaps O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
much O
of O
what O
she O
was O
reading O
, O
and O
her O
thoughts O
were O
elsewhere O
: O
but O
the O
sleep O
project O
, O
with O
poor O
Mick’s S-PERSON
nightcap O
there O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
was O
quite O
a O
vain O
one O
. O
So O
it O
is O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Jack S-PERSON
or O
Donald S-PERSON
marches O
away O
to O
glory O
with O
his O
knapsack O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
stepping O
out O
briskly O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
“ O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Girl I-WORK_OF_ART
I I-WORK_OF_ART
left I-WORK_OF_ART
Behind E-WORK_OF_ART
me O

” O
It O
is O
she O
who O
remains O
and O
suffers O
, O
— O
and O
has O
the O
leisure O
to O
think O
, O
and O
brood O
, O
and O
remember O
. O
Knowing O
how O
useless O
regrets O
are O
, O
and O
how O
the O
indulgence O
of O
sentiment O
only O
serves O
to O
make O
people O
more O
miserable O
, O
Mrs. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
wisely O
determined O
to O
give O
way O
to O
no O
vain O
feelings O
of O
sorrow O
, O
and O
bore O
the O
parting O
from O
her O
husband O
with O
quite O
a O
Spartan S-NORP
equanimity O
. O
Indeed O
Captain O
Rawdon S-PERSON
himself O
was O
much O
more O
affected O
at O
the O
leave O
- O
taking O
than O
the O
resolute O
little O
woman O
to O
whom O
he O
bade O
farewell O
. O
She O
had O
mastered O
this O
rude O
coarse O
nature O
| | O
and O
he O
loved O
and O
worshipped O
her O
with O
all O
his O
faculties O
of O
regard O
and O
admiration O
. O
In O
all O
his O
life O
he O
had O
never O
been O
so O
happy O
, O
as O
, O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
his O
wife O
had O
made O
him O
. O
All O
former O
delights O
of O
turf O
, O

, O
hunting O
- O
field O
, O
and O
gambling O

all O
previous O
loves O
and O
courtships O
of O
milliners O
, O
opera- O

, O
and O
the O
like O
easy O
triumphs O
of O
the O
clumsy O
military O
Adonis S-PERSON
, O
were O
quite O
insipid O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
lawful O
matrimonial O
pleasures O
which O
of O
late O
he O
had O
enjoyed O
. O
She O
had O
known O
perpetually O
how O
to O
divert O
him O
| | O
and O
he O
had O
found O
his O
house O
and O
her O
society O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
times O
more O
pleasant O
than O
any O
place O
or O
company O
which O
he O
had O
ever O
frequented O
from O
his O
childhood O
until O
now O
. O
And O
he O
cursed O
his O
past O
follies O
and O
extravagances O
, O
and O
bemoaned O
his O
vast O
outlying O
debts O
above O
all O
, O
which O
must O
remain O
forever O
as O
obstacles O
to O
prevent O
his O
wife’s O
advancement O
in O
the O
world O
. O
He O
had O
often O
groaned O
over O
these O
in O
midnight S-TIME
conversations O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
although O
as O
a O
bachelor O
they O
had O
never O
given O
him O
any O
disquiet O
. O
He O
himself O
was O
struck O
with O
this O
phenomenon O
. O
“ O
Hang O
it O
, O
” O
he O
would O
say O
( O
or O
perhaps O
use O
a O
still O
stronger O
expression O
out O
of O
his O
simple O
vocabulary O
) O
, O
“ O
before O
I O
was O
married O
I O
didn’t O
care O
what O
bills O
I O
put O
my O
name O
to O
, O
and O
so O
long O
as O
Moses S-PERSON
would O
wait O
or O
Levy S-PERSON
would O
renew O
for O
three B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
I O
kept O
on O
never O
minding O
. O
But O
since O
I’m O
married O
, O
except O
renewing O
, O
of O
course O
, O
I O
give O
you O
my O
honour O
I’ve O
not O
touched O
a O
bit O
of O
stamped O
paper O
. O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
always O
knew O
how O
to O
conjure O
away O
these O
moods O
of O
melancholy O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
my O
stupid O
love O
, O
” O
she O
would O
say O
, O
“ O
we O
have O
not O
done O
with O
your O
aunt O
yet O
. O
If O
she O
fails O
us O
, O
isn’t O
there O
what O
you O
call O
the O
Gazette S-ORG
? O

, O
stop O
, O
when O
your O
uncle O
Bute’s O
life O
drops O
, O
I O
have O
another O
scheme O
. O
The O
living O
has O
always O
belonged O
to O
the O
younger O
brother O
, O
and O
why O
shouldn’t O
you O
sell O
out O
and O
go O
into O
the O
Church S-ORG
? O
” O
The O
idea O
of O
this O
conversion O
set O
Rawdon S-PERSON
into O
roars O
of O
laughter O
: O
you O
might O
have O
heard O
the O
explosion O
through O
the O
hotel O
at O
midnight S-TIME
, O
and O
the O
haw O
- O
haws O
of O
the O
great O
dragoon’s O
voice O
. O
General O
Tufto S-PERSON
heard O
him O
from O
his O
quarters O
on O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
floor O
above O
them O
| | O
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
acted O
the O
scene O
with O
great O
spirit O
, O
and O
preached O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
sermon O
, O
to O
the O
immense O
delight O
of O
the O
General O
at O
breakfast O
. O
But O
these O
were O
mere O
by O
- O
gone O
days O
and O
talk O
. O
When O
the O
final O
news O
arrived O
that O
the O
campaign O
was O
opened O
, O
and O
the O
troops O
were O
to O
march O
, O
Rawdon’s S-NORP
gravity O
became O
such O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
rallied O
him O
about O
it O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
rather O
hurt O
the O
feelings O
of O
the O
Guardsman S-ORG
. O
“ O
You O
don’t O
suppose O
I’m O
afraid O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
I O
should O
think O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
tremor O
in O
his O
voice O
. O
“ O
But O
I’m O
a O
pretty O
good O
mark O
for O
a O
shot O

and O
you O
see O
if O
it O
brings O
me O
down O
, O
why O
I O
leave O
one O
and O
perhaps O
two S-CARDINAL
behind O
me O

I O
should O
wish O
to O
provide O
for O

I O
brought O
’em O
into O
the O

no O

matter O
that O

anyways O
. O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
by O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
caresses O
and O
kind O
words O
tried O
to O
soothe O
the O
feelings O
of O
the O
wounded O
lover O
. O
It O
was O
only O
when O
her O
vivacity O
and O
sense O
of O
humour O
got O
the O
better O
of O
this O
sprightly O
creature O
( O
as O
they O
would O
do O
under O
most O
circumstances O
of O
life O
indeed O
) O
that O
she O
would O
break O
out O
with O
her O
satire O
, O
but O
she O
could O
soon O
put O
on O
a O
demure O
face O
. O
“ O
Dearest O
love O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
do O
you O
suppose O
I O
feel O
nothing O
? O
” O
and O
hastily O
dashing O
something O
from O
her O
eyes O
, O
she O
looked O
up O
in O
her O
husband’s O
face O
with O
a O
smile O
. O
“ O
Look O
here O
, O
” O
said O
he O

“ O
If O

us O

this O
famous O

off O

put O

He O
rode O
by O

smoked O
his O
cigar O

broke O

And O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O
wisely O
determined O
not O
to O
give O
way O
to O
unavailing O
sentimentality O
on O
her O
husband’s O
departure O

She O
waved O
him O
an O
adieu O
from O
the O
window O

and O
stood O
there O
for O
a O
moment O
looking O
out O
after O
he O
was O
gone O
. O
The O
cathedral O
towers O
and O
the O
full O
gables O
of O
the O
quaint O
old O
houses O
were O
just O
beginning O
to O
blush O
in O
the O
sunrise O
. O
There O
had O
been O
no O
rest O
for O
her O
that O
night O
. O
She O
was O
still O
in O
her O
pretty O
ball O
- O
dress O
, O
her O
fair O
hair O
hanging O
somewhat O
out O
of O
curl O
on O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
circles O
round O
her O
eyes O
dark O
with O
watching O
. O
“ O
What O
a O
fright O
I O
seem O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
examining O
herself O
in O
the O
glass O
, O
“ O
and O
how O
pale O
this O
pink O
makes O
one O
look O
! O
” O
So O
she O
divested O
herself O
of O
this O
pink O
raiment O

in O
doing O
which O
a O
note O
fell O
out O
from O
her O
corsage O
, O
which O
she O
picked O
up O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
and O
locked O
into O
her O
dressing O
- O
box O
. O
And O
then O
she O
put O
her O
bouquet O
of O
the O
ball O
into O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
slept O
very O
comfortably O
. O
The O
town O
was O
quite O
quiet O
when O
she O
woke O
up O
at O
ten B-TIME
o’clock E-TIME
, O
and O
partook O
of O
coffee O
, O
very O
requisite O
and O
comforting O
after O
the O
exhaustion O
and O
grief O
of O
the O
morning’s O
occurrences O
. O
This O
meal O
over O
, O
she O
resumed O
honest O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
calculations O
of O
the O
night O
previous O
, O
and O
surveyed O
her O
position O
. O
Should O
the O
worst O
befall O
, O
all O
things O
considered O
, O
she O
was O
pretty O
well O
to O
do O
. O
There O
were O
her O
own O
trinkets O
and O
trousseau O

to O
those O

the O
little O

the O
General O

made O
her O
many O
very O
handsome O
presents O
, O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
cashmere O

numerous O

his B-TIME
usual I-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
rising O
in O
the O
forenoon O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
drums O
, O
bugles O
, O
and O
bagpipes O
in O
the O
British S-NORP
army O
, O
but O
for O
an O
interruption O
, O
which O
did O
not O
come O
from O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
, O
who O
shared O
Jos’s S-PERSON
quarters O
with O
him O
, O
and O
was O
as O
usual O
occupied O
too O
much O
with O
his O
own O
affairs O
or O
with O
grief O
at O
parting O
with O
his O
wife O
, O
to O
think O
of O
taking O
leave O
of O
his O
slumbering O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
— O
it O
was O
not O
George S-PERSON
, O
we O
say O
, O
who O
interposed O
between O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
and O
sleep O
, O
but O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
came O
and O
roused O
him O
up O
, O
insisting O
on O
shaking O
hands O
with O
him O
before O
his O
departure O
. O
“ O
Very O
kind O
of O
you O
, O
” O
said O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
yawning O
, O
and O
wishing O
the O
Captain O
at O
the O
deuce O
. O
“ O
I O
— O
I O
didn’t O
like O
to O
go O
off O
without O
saying O
good O
- O
bye O
, O
you O
know O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
said O
in O
a O
very O
incoherent O
manner O
| | O
“ O
because O
you O
know O
some O
of O
us O
mayn’t O
come O
back O
again O
, O
and O
I O
like O
to O
see O
you O
all O
well O
, O
and O
— O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
, O
you O
know O
. O
” O
“ O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
asked O
, O
rubbing O
his O
eyes O
. O
The O
Captain O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
hear O
him O
or O
look O
at O
the O
stout O
gentleman O
in O
the O
nightcap O
, O
about O
whom O
he O
professed O
to O
have O
such O
a O
tender O
interest O
. O
The O
hypocrite O
was O
looking O
and O
listening O
with O
all O
his O
might O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
George’s S-NORP
apartments O
, O
striding O
about O
the O
room O
, O
upsetting O
the O
chairs O
, O
beating O
the O
tattoo O
, O
biting O
his O
nails O
, O
and O
showing O
other O
signs O
of O
great O
inward O
emotion O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
always O
had O
rather O
a O
mean O
opinion O
of O
the O
Captain O
, O
and O
now O
began O
to O
think O
his O
courage O
was O
somewhat O
equivocal O
. O
“ O
What O
is O
it O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
? O
” O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
sarcastic O
tone O
. O
] O
“ O
I O
tell O
you O
what O
you O
can O
do O
, O
” O
the O
Captain O
replied O
, O
coming O
up O
to O
the O
bed O
| | O
“ O
we O
march O
in O
a B-TIME
quarter I-TIME
of I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
and O
neither O
George S-PERSON
nor O
I O
may O
ever O
come O
back O
. O
Mind O
you O
, O
you O
are O
not O
to O
stir O
from O
this O
town O
until O
you O
ascertain O
how O
things O
go O
. O
You O
are O
to O
stay O
here O
and O
watch O
over O
your O
sister O
, O
and O
comfort O
her O
, O
and O
see O
that O
no O
harm O
comes O
to O
her O
. O
If O
anything O
happens O
to O
George S-PERSON
, O
remember O
she O
has O
no O
one O
but O
you O
in O
the O
world O
to O
look O
to O
. O
If O
it O
goes O
wrong O
with O
the O
army O
, O
you’ll O
see O
her O
safe O
back O
to O
England S-GPE

and O
you O
will O
promise O
me O
on O
your O
word O
that O
you O
will O
never O
desert O
her O
. O
I O
know O
you O
won’t O
: O
as O
far O
as O
money O
goes O
, O
you O
were O
always O
free O
enough O
with O
that O
. O
Do O
you O
want O
any O
? O
I O
mean O
, O
have O
you O
enough O
gold O
to O
take O
you O
back O
to O
England S-GPE
in O
case O
of O
a O
misfortune O
? O
” O
“ O
Sir O
, O
” O
said O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
majestically O
, O
“ O
when O
I O
want O
money O
, O
I O
know O
where O
to O
ask O
for O
it O

And O
as O
for O
my O
sister O
, O
you O
needn’t O
tell O
me O
how O
I O
ought O
to O
behave O
to O
her O
. O
” O
“ O
You O
speak O
like O
a O
man O
of O
spirit O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
” O
the O
other O
answered O
good O
- O
naturedly O
, O
“ O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
that O
George S-PERSON
can O
leave O
her O
in O
such O
good O
hands O
. O
So O
I O
may O
give O
him O
your O
word O
of O
honour O
, O
may O
I O
, O
that O
in O
case O
of O
extremity O
you O
will O
stand O
by O
her O
? O
” O
“ O
Of O
course O
, O
of O
course O
, O
” O
answered O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
whose O
generosity O
in O
money O
matters O
Dobbin S-PERSON
estimated O
quite O
correctly O
. O
“ O
And O
you’ll O
see O
her O
safe O
out O
of O
Brussels S-GPE
in O
the O
event O

a O
defeat O
? O
” O
“ O
A O
defeat O
! O
D O
— O
it O
, O
sir O
, O
it’s O
impossible O
. O
Don’t O
try O
and O
frighten O
me O
, O
” O
the O
hero O
cried O
from O
his O
bed O
| | O
and O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
mind O
was O
thus O
perfectly O
set O
at O
ease O
now O
that O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
spoken O
out O
so O
resolutely O
respecting O
his O
conduct O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
“ O
At O
least O
, O
” O
thought O
the O
Captain O
, O
“ O
there O
will O
be O
a O
retreat O
secured O
for O
her O
in O
case O
the O
worst O
should O
ensue O
. O
” O
If O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
expected O
to O
get O
any O
personal O
comfort O
and O
satisfaction O
from O
having O
one S-CARDINAL
more O
view O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
before O
the O
regiment O
marched O
away O
, O
his O
selfishness O
was O
punished O
just O
as O
such O
odious O
egotism O
deserved O
to O
be O
. O
The O
door O
of O
Jos’s B-FAC
bed-room E-FAC
opened O
into O
the O
sitting O
- O
room O
which O
was O
common O
to O
the O
family O
party O
, O
and O
opposite O
this O
door O
was O
that O
of O
Amelia’s S-NORP
chamber O
. O
The O
bugles O
had O
wakened O
everybody O
: O
there O
was O
no O
use O
in O
concealment O
now O
. O
George’s S-PERSON
servant O
was O
packing O
in O
this O
room O
: O
Osborne S-PERSON
coming O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
contiguous O
bed- O
room O
, O
flinging O
to O
the O
man O
such O
articles O
as O
he O
thought O
fit O
to O
carry O
on O
the O
campaign O
. O
And O
presently O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
the O
opportunity O
which O
his O
heart O
coveted O
, O
and O
he O
got O
sight O
of O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
face O
once O
more O
. O
But O
what O
a O
face O
it O
was O
! O
So O
white O
, O
so O
wild O
and O
despair O
stricken O
, O
that O
the O
remembrance O
of O
it O
haunted O
him O
afterwards O
like O
a O
crime O
, O
and O
the O
sight O
smote O
him O
with O
inexpressible O
pangs O
of O
longing O
and O
pity O
. O
She O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
white O
morning O
dress O
, O
her O
hair O
falling O
on O
her O
shoulders O
, O
and O
her O
large O
eyes O
fixed O
and O
without O
light O
. O
By O
way O
of O
helping O
on O
the O
preparations O
for O
the O
departure O
, O
and O
showing O
that O
she O
too O
could O
be O
useful O
at O
a O
moment O
so O
critical O
, O
this O
poor O
soul O
had O
taken O
up O
a O
sash O
of O
George’s O
from O
the O
drawers O
whereon O
it O
lay O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
to O
and O
fro O
with O
the O
sash O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
looking O
on O
mutely O
as O
his O
packing O
proceeded O
. O
She O
came O
out O
and O
stood O
, O
leaning O
at O
the O
wall O
, O
holding O
this O
sash O
against O
her O
bosom O
, O
from O
which O
the O
heavy O
net O
of O
crimson O
dropped O
like O
a O
large O
stain O
of O
blood O
. O
Our O
gentle O
- O
hearted O
Captain O
felt O
a O
guilty O
shock O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
. O
“ O
Good O
God O
, O
” O
thought O
he O
, O
“ O
and O
is O
it O
grief O
like O
this O
I O
dared O
to O
pry O
into O
? O
” O
And O
there O
was O
no O
help O
: O
no O
means O
to O
soothe O
and O
comfort O
this O
helpless O
, O
speechless O
misery O
. O
He O
stood O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
, O
powerless O
and O
torn O
with O
pity O
, O
as O
a O
parent O
regards O
an O
infant O
in O
pain O
. O
At O
last O
, O
George S-PERSON
took O
Emmy’s S-PERSON
hand O
, O
and O
led O
her O
back O
into O
the O
bed- O
room O
, O
from O
whence O
he O
came O
out O
alone O
. O
The O
parting O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
that O
moment O
, O
and O
he O
was O
gone O
. O
“ O
Thank O
Heaven O
that O
is O
over O
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
thought O
, O
bounding O
down O
the O
stair O
, O
his O
sword O
under O
his O
arm O
, O
as O
he O
ran O
swiftly O
to O
the O
alarm O
ground O
, O
where O
the O
regiment O
was O
mustered O
, O
and O
whither O
trooped O
men O
and O
officers O
hurrying O
from O
their O
billets O
| | O
his O
pulse O
was O
throbbing O
and O
his O
cheeks O
flushed O
: O
the O
great O
game O
of O
war O
was O
going O
to O
be O
played O
, O
and O
he O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
players O
. O
What O
a O
fierce O
excitement O
of O
doubt O
, O
hope O
, O
and O
pleasure O
! O
What O
tremendous O
hazards O
of O
loss O
or O
gain O
! O
What O
were O
all O
the O
games O
of O
chance O
he O
had O
ever O
played O
compared O
to O
this O
one O
? O
Into O
all O
contests O
requiring O
athletic O
skill O
and O
courage O
, O
the O
young O
man O
, O
from O
his O
boyhood O
upwards O
, O
had O
flung O
himself O
with O
all O
his O
might O
. O
The O
champion O
of O
his O
school O
and O
his O
regiment O
, O
the O
bravos O
of O
his O
companions O
had O
followed O
him O
everywhere O
| | O
from O
the O
boy’s O
cricket O
- O
match O
to O
the O
garrison O
races O
, O
he O
had O
won O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
of O
triumphs O
| | O
and O
wherever O
he O
went O
, O
women O
and O
men O
had O
admired O
and O
envied O
him O
. O
What O
qualities O
are O
there O
for O
which O
a O
man O
gets O
so O
speedy O
a O
return O
of O
applause O
, O
as O
those O
of O
bodily O
superiority O

activity O
, O
and O
valour O
? O
Time O
out O
of O
mind O
strength O
and O
courage O
have O
been O
the O
theme O
of O
bards O
and O
romances O
| | O
and O
from O
the O
story O
of O
Troy S-PERSON
down O
to O
to O
- O
day O
, O
poetry O
has O
always O
chosen O
a O
soldier O
for O
a O
hero O
. O
I O
wonder O
is O
it O
because O
men O
are O
cowards O
in O
heart O
that O
they O
admire O
bravery O
so O
much O
, O
and O
place O
military O
valour O
so O
far O
beyond O
every O
other O
quality O
for O
reward O
and O
worship O
? O
So O
, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
that O
stirring O
call O
to O
battle O
, O
George S-PERSON
jumped O
away O
from O
the O
gentle O
arms O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
dallying O
| | O
not O
without O
a O
feeling O
of O
shame O
( O
although O
his O
wife’s O
hold O
on O
him O
had O
been O
but O
feeble O
) O
, O
that O
he O
should O
have O
been O
detained O
there O
so O
long O
. O
The O
same O
feeling O
of O
eagerness O
and O
excitement O
was O
amongst O
all O
those O
friends O
of O
his O
of O
whom O
we O
have O
had O
occasional O
glimpses O
, O
from O
the O
stout O
senior O
Major S-PERSON
, O
who O
led O
the O
regiment O
into O
action O
, O
to O
little O
Stubble O
, O
the O
Ensign S-PRODUCT
, O
who O
was O
to O
bear O
its O
colours O
on O
that B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
The O
sun O
was O
just O
rising O
as O
the O
march O
began O
— O
it O
was O
a O
gallant O
sight O
— O
the O
band O
led O
the O
column O
, O
playing O
the O
regimental O
march O
— O
then O
came O
the O
Major O
in O
command O
, O
riding O
upon O
Pyramus S-PERSON
, O
his O
stout O
charger O

marched O
the O
grenadiers O

looked O

the O
occurrences O

morning O

Jos S-PERSON
nevertheless O
remained O
for O
many O
hours O
in O
bed O
, O
wakeful O
and O
rolling O
about O
there O
until O
his B-TIME
usual I-TIME
hour E-TIME
of O
rising O
had O
arrived O
. O
The O
sun O
was O
high O
in O
the O
heavens O
, O
and O
our O
gallant O
friends O
of O
the O
— O
th O
miles O
on O
their O
march O
, O
before O
the O
civilian O
appeared O
in O
his O
flowered O
dressing O

gown O
at O
breakfast O
. O
About O
George’s S-PERSON
absence O
, O
his O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
very O
easy O
in O
mind O
. O
Perhaps O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
rather O
pleased O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
gone O
, O
for O
during O
George’s S-PERSON
presence O
, O
the O
other O
had O
played O
but O
a O
very O
secondary O
part O
in O
the O
household O
, O
and O
Osborne S-PERSON
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
show O
his O
contempt O
of O
the O
stout O
civilian O
. O
But O
Emmy S-PERSON
had O
always O
been O
good O
and O
attentive O
to O
him O
. O
It O
was O
she O
who O
ministered O
to O
his O
comforts O
, O
who O
superintended O
the O
dishes O
that O
he O
liked O
, O
who O
walked O
or O
rode O
with O
him O
( O
as O
she O
had O
many O
, O
too O
many O
, O
opportunities O
of O
doing O
, O
for O
where O
was O
George S-PERSON
? O
) O
and O
who O
interposed O
her O
sweet O
face O
between O
his O
anger O
and O
her O
husband’s O
scorn O
. O
Many O
timid O
remonstrances O
had O
she O
uttered O
to O
George S-PERSON
in O
behalf O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
but O
the O
former O
in O
his O
trenchant O
way O
cut O
these O
entreaties O
short O
. O
“ O
I’m O
an O
honest O
man O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
and O
if O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
I O
show O
it O
, O
as O
an O
honest O
man O
will O
. O
How O
the O
deuce O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
would O
you O
have O
me O
behave O
respectfully O
to O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
your O
brother O
? O
” O
So O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
pleased O
with O
George’s S-PERSON
absence O
. O
His O
plain O
hat O
, O
and O
gloves O
on O
a O
sideboard O
, O
and O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
owner O
was O
away O
, O
caused O
Jos S-PERSON
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
secret O
thrill O
of O
pleasure O
. O
“ O
He O
won’t O
be O
troubling O
me O
this O
morning O
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
thought O
, O
“ O
with O
his O
dandified O
airs O
and O
his O
impudence O
. O
” O
“ O
Put O
the O
Captain’s O
hat O
into O
the O
ante-room O
, O
” O
he O
said O
to O
Isidor S-PERSON
, O
the O
servant O
. O
“ O
Perhaps O
he O
won’t O
want O
it O
again O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
lackey O
, O
looking O
knowingly O
at O
his O
master O
. O
He O
hated O
George S-PERSON
too O
, O
whose O
insolence O
towards O
him O
was O
quite O
of O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
sort O
. O
“ O
And O
ask O
if O
Madame S-PERSON
is O
coming O
to O
breakfast O
, O
” O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
said O
with O
great O
majesty O
, O
ashamed O
to O
enter O
with O
a O
servant O
upon O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
dislike O
for O
George S-PERSON
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
he O
had O
abused O
his O
brother O
to O
the O
valet O
a O
score O
of O
times O
before O
. O
Alas O
! O
Madame S-PERSON
could O
not O
come O
to O
breakfast O
, O
and O
cut O
the O
tartines O
that O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
liked O
. O
Madame S-PERSON
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
ill O
, O
and O
had O
been O
in O
a O
frightful O
state O
ever O
since O
her O
husband’s O
departure O
, O
so O
her O
bonne O
said O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
showed O
his O
sympathy O
, O
by O
pouring O
her O
out O
a O
large O
cup O
of O
tea O
. O
It O
was O
his O
way O
of O
exhibiting O
kindness O
: O
and O
he O
improved O
on O
this O
| | O
he O
not O
only O
sent O
her O
breakfast O
, O
but O
he O
bethought O
him O
what O
delicacies O
she O
would O
most O
like O
for O
dinner O
. O
Isidor S-PERSON
, O
the O
valet O
, O
had O
looked O
on O
very O
sulkily O
, O
while O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
servant O
was O
disposing O
of O
his O
master’s O
baggage O
previous O
to O
the O
Captain’s S-PERSON
departure O
: O
for O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
he O
hated O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
whose O
conduct O
to O
him O
, O
and O
to O
all O
inferiors O
, O
was O
generally O
overbearing O
, O
( O
nor O
does O
the O
continental O
domestic O
like O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
insolence O
as O
our O
own O
better O
- O
tempered O
servants O
do O
: O
) O
and O
secondly O
, O
he O
was O
angry O
that O
so O
many O
valuables O
should O
be O
removed O
from O
under O
his O
hands O
, O
to O
fall O
into O
other O
people’s O
possession O
when O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
discomfiture O
should O
arrive O
. O
Of O
this O
defeat O
he O
and O
a O
vast O
number O
of O
other O
persons O
in O
Brussels S-GPE
and O
Belgium S-GPE
did O
not O
make O
the O
slightest O
doubt O
. O
The O
almost O
universal O
belief O
was O
, O
that O
the O
Emperor O
would O
divide O
the O
Prussian S-NORP
and O
English S-LANGUAGE
armies O
, O
annihilate O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
and O
march O
into O
Brussels S-GPE
before O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
were O
over O
: O
when O
all O
the O
moveables O
of O
his O
present O
masters O
, O
who O
would O
be O
killed O
, O
or O
fugitives O
, O
or O
prisoners O
, O
would O
lawfully O
become O
the O
property O
of O
Monsieur B-PERSON
Isidor E-PERSON
. O
As O
he O
helped O
Jos S-PERSON
through O
his O
toilsome O
and O
complicated O
daily O
toilette O
, O
this O
faithful O
servant O
would O
calculate O
what O
he O
should O
do O
with O
the O
very O
articles O
with O
which O
he O
was O
decorating O
his O
master’s O
person O
. O
He O
would O
make O
a O
present O
of O
the O
silver O
essence O
- O
bottles O
and O
toilet O
knicknacks O
to O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
whom O
he O
was O
fond O
| | O
and O
keep O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
cutlery O
and O
the O
large O
ruby O
pin O
for O
himself O
. O
It O
would O
look O
very O
smart O
upon O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
fine O
frilled O
shirts O
, O
which O
, O
with O
the O
gold O
- O
laced O
cap O
and O
the O
frogged O
frock O
coat O
, O
that O
might O
easily O
be O
cut O
down O
to O
suit O
his O
shape O
, O
and O
the O
Captain’s O
gold O
- O
headed O
cane O
, O
and O
the O
great O
double O
ring O
with O
the O
rubies O
, O
which O
he O
would O
have O
made O
into O
a O
pair O
of O
beautiful O
earrings O
, O
he O
calculated O
would O
make O
a O
perfect O
Adonis S-PERSON
of O
himself O
, O
and O
render O
Mademoiselle B-PERSON
Reine E-PERSON
an O
easy O
prey O
. O
“ O
How O
those O
sleeve O
- O
but O
- O
tons O
will O
suit O
me O
! O
” O
thought O
he O
, O
as O
he O
fixed O
a O
pair O
on O
the O
fat O
pudgy O
wrists O
of O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
long O
for O
sleeve O
- O
buttons O

and O
the O
Captain’s O
boots O
with O
brass O
spurs O
, O
in O
the O
next O
room O
, O
corbleu O
! O
what O
an O
effect O
they O
will O
make O
in O
the B-FAC
Allée I-FAC
Verte E-FAC
! O
” O
So O
while O
Monsieur B-PERSON
Isidor E-PERSON
with O
bodily O
fingers O
was O
holding O
on O
to O
his O
master’s O
nose O
, O
and O
shaving O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
Jos’s S-PERSON
face O
, O
his O
imagination O
was O
rambling O
along O
the B-FAC
Green I-FAC
Avenue E-FAC
, O
dressed O
out O
in O
a O
frogged O
coat O
and O
lace O
, O
and O
in O
company O
with O
Mademoiselle B-PERSON
Reine E-PERSON
| | O
he O
was O
loitering O
in O
spirit O
on O
the O
banks O
, O
and O
examining O
the O
barges O
sailing O
slowly O
under O
the O
cool O
shadows O
of O
the O
trees O
by O
the O
canal O
, O
or O
refreshing O
himself O
with O
a O
mug O
of O
Faro S-GPE
at O
the O
bench O
of O
a O
beer O
- O
house O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Laeken S-GPE
. O
But O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
, O
luckily O
for O
his O
own O
peace O
, O
no O
more O
knew O
what O
was O
passing O
in O
his O
domestic’s O
mind O
than O
the O
respected O
reader O
, O
and O
I O
suspect O
what O
John S-PERSON
or O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
whose O
wages O
we O
pay O
, O
think O
of O
ourselves O
. O
What O
our O
servants O
think O
of O
us O
! O
— O
Did O
we O
know O
what O
our O
intimates O
and O
dear O
relations O
thought O
of O
us O
, O
we O
should O
live O
in O
a O
world O
that O
we O
should O
be O
glad O
to O
quit O
, O
and O
in O
a O
frame O
of O
mind O
and O
a O
constant O
terror O
, O
that O
would O
be O
perfectly O
unbearable O
. O
So O
Jos’s S-PERSON
man O
was O
marking O
his O
victim O
down O
, O
as O
you O
see O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Mr. O
Paynter’s S-PERSON
assistants O
in O
Leadenhall B-FAC

“ O

” O
Amelia’s O
attendant O
was O
much O
less O
selfishly O
disposed O
. O
Few O
dependants O
could O
come O
near O
that O
kind O

gentle O
creature O
without O
paying O
their O
usual O
tribute O
of O
loyalty O

affection O
to O
her O
sweet O
and O
affectionate O
nature O

And O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
Pauline S-PERSON
, O
the O
cook O
, O
consoled O
her O
mistress O
more O
than O
anybody O
whom O
she O
saw O
on O
this O
wretched O
morning O

for O
when O
she O
found O
how O
Amelia S-PERSON
remained O
for O
hours O
, O
silent O
, O
motionless O
, O
and O
haggard O
, O
by O
the O
windows O
in O
which O
she O
had O
placed O
herself O
to O
watch O
the O
last O
bayonets O
of O
the O
column O
as O
it O
marched O
away O
, O
the O
honest O
girl O
took O
the O
lady’s O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
Tenez S-PERSON

Madame S-PERSON
, O

with O
which O
she O
burst O
into O
tears O
, O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
falling O
into O
her O
arms O
, O
did O
likewise O
, O
and O
so O
each O
pitied O

soothed O
the O
other O

Several O
times O
during O
the O
forenoon O
Mr. O
Jos’s B-PERSON
Isidor E-PERSON
went O
from O
his O
lodgings O
into O

to O
the O

the O

round O
about O
the O
Parc S-FAC

where O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
were O
congregated O

there O
mingled O
with O
other O
valets O
, O
couriers O
, O

lackeys O
, O
gathered O
such O
news O
as O
was O
abroad O
, O

brought O
back O
bulletins O
for O
his O
master’s O
information O

Almost O
all O
these O
gentlemen O
were O
in O
heart O
partisans O
of O
the O
Emperor O

had O
their O
opinions O
about O
the O
speedy O
end O
of O
the O
campaign O

The O
Emperor’s O

plentifully O
in O

“ O

the O
partisans O

prophesied O
a O
more O
speedy O
extermination O
of O

this O

it O
was O
agreed O
on O
all O

up O

Amelia S-PERSON

entered O
without O
ringing O
at O
the O
antechamber O

Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
dressed O
very O
neatly O

smartly O
, O
as O
usual O
: O
her O
quiet O
sleep O
after O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
departure O
had O
refreshed O
her O
, O

her O
pink O
smiling O
cheeks O
were O
quite O
pleasant O
to O
look O
at O
, O
in O
a O
town O

on O
a O
day O
when O
everybody O
else’s O
countenance O
wore O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
deepest O
anxiety O

gloom O

She O
laughed O
at O
the O
attitude O
in O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
discovered O
, O

the O
struggles O

convulsions O
with O

the O
stout O
gentleman O

himself O

the O
braided O

Jos S-PERSON
succeeded O
in O
plunging O
into O
the O
coat O
, O

came O
forward O
blushing O

stuttering O
out O
excuses O
to O
his O
fair O
visitor O

“ O
How O
was O
she O
after O

” O
Monsieur B-PERSON
Isidor E-PERSON
disappeared O
into O
his O
master’s O
adjacent O
bed- O
room O

bearing O
off O
the O
flowered O
dressing O

gown O

“ O
How O
good O
of O
you O
to O
ask O

she O

pressing O
one S-CARDINAL

his O
hands O

both O
her O

cool O

“ O
Tremendous O

Jos S-PERSON
said O

“ O
You O
men O
can O
bear O
anything O

replied O
the O
lady O
. O
“ O
Parting O

danger O

nothing O

so O
frightened O

the O

into O
my O

that O

ran O
off O
immediately O
to O
beg O

entreat O
you O
not O
to O
fly O
from O
us O

” O
This O
speech O
might O
be O
interpreted O
, O
“ O
My O
dear O
sir O

should O
an O
accident O

seat O

” O
I O
don’t O
know O
whether O
Jos S-PERSON
understood O
the O
words O
in O
this O
sense O
. O
But O
he O
was O
profoundly O
mortified O
by O
the O
lady’s O
inattention O
to O
him O
during O
their O
stay O
at O
Brussels S-GPE

He O
had O
never O
been O
presented O
to O
any O
of O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley’s E-PERSON
great O
acquaintances O

he O
had O
scarcely O
been O
invited O
to O
Rebecca’s S-NORP
parties O

for O
he O
was O
too O
timid O
to O
play O
much O
, O
and O
his O
presence O
bored O
George S-PERSON
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
equally O
, O
who O
neither O
of O
them O
, O
perhaps O
, O
liked O
to O
have O
a O
witness O
of O
the O
amusements O
in O
which O
the O
pair O
chose O
to O
indulge O

“ O
Ah O
! O
” O
thought O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
“ O
now O
she O
wants O
me O

” O
But O
besides O
these O
doubts O
he O
felt O
flattered O
at O
the O
idea O
Rebecca S-PERSON
expressed O
of O
his O
courage O
. O
He O
blushed O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
and O
put O
on O
an O
air O
of O
importance O
. O
“ O
I O
should O
like O

see O
the O
action O

“ O

“ O

would O
sacrifice O
any O
thing O

a O
pleasure O

Rebecca S-PERSON
answered O

“ O
Captain O

left O

this O
morning O

“ O

quite O
soothed O

with O
his O
finger O
to O
the O
door O
of O
the O
chamber O
in O
which O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
. O
“ O
Good O
noble O
brother O
! O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
putting O
her O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
smelling O
the O
eau O
- O
de O

cologne O
with O
which O
it O
was O
scented O
. O
“ O

“ O

upon O

” O
Jos S-PERSON
said O
, O
making O
a O
motion O
as O
if O
he O
would O
lay O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
spot O
in O
question O
. O
“ O

now O

remember O
two B-DATE

— O
when O
it O
was O
false O
to O

” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
fixing O
her O
eyes O
upon O
him O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
and O
then O
turning O
away O
into O
the O
window O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
blushed O
violently O
. O
That O
organ O
which O
he O
was O
accused O
by O
Rebecca S-PERSON
of O
not O
possessing O
began O
to O
thump O
tumultuously O
. O
He O
recalled O
the O
days O
when O
he O
had O
fled O
from O
her O
, O
and O
the O
passion O
which O
had O
once O
inflamed O
him O
— O
the O
days O
when O
he O
had O
driven O
her O
in O
his O
curricle O
: O
when O
she O
had O
knit O
the O
green O
purse O
for O
him O
: O
when O
he O
had O
sat O
enraptured O
gazing O
at O
her O
white O
arms O
and O
bright O
eyes O
. O
“ O
I O
know O
you O
think O
me O
ungrateful O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
continued O
, O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
and O
once O
more O
looking O
at O
him O
and O
addressing O
him O
in O
a O
low O
tremulous O
voice O
. O
“ O
Your O
coldness O

your O

I O
came O
in O
just O
now O

all O
proved O
it O
to O

But O
were O
there O
no O
reasons O
why O
I O
should O
avoid O
you O

Let O
your O
own O
heart O
answer O
that O
question O
. O
Do O
you O

” O
“ O
Good O

! O
what O
have O

” O
asked O
Jos S-PERSON
in O
a O
flurry O
of O
pleasure O

perplexity O

“ O

said O
Rebecca S-PERSON

“ O

” O
All O
Jos’s S-PERSON
blood O
tingled O
with O
delight O
, O
as O
he O
surveyed O
this O
victim O
to O
his O
attractions O
. O
A O
few O
adroit O
words O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
knowing O
tender O
glances O
of O
the O

his O
heart O
was O
inflamed O
again O

his O
doubts O

forgotten O

Solomon S-PERSON

“ O

Becky S-PERSON

There O

his O

began O
to O
busy O
himself O
about O
the O
domestic O
affairs O

Jos S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
just O
going O
to O
gasp O
out O
an O
avowal O
, O
choked O
almost O
with O
the O
emotion O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
restrain O

Rebecca S-PERSON
too O
bethought O
her O
that O
it O
was O
time O

should O
go O
in O

comfort O
her O
dearest O
Amelia S-PERSON

“ O

” O
she O
said O
, O
kissing O
her O
hand O
to O
Mr. O
Joseph S-PERSON
, O
and O
tapped O
gently O
at O
the O
door O
of O
his O
sister’s O
apartment O
. O
As O
she O
entered O

closed O
the O
door O
on O
herself O
, O
he O
sank O
down O
in O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
gazed O
and O
sighed O
and O
puffed O
portentously O
. O
“ O
That O
coat O
is O
very O
tight O
for O
Milor S-PERSON

Isidor S-PERSON
said O
, O
still O
having O
his O
eye O
on O
the O

his O
master O
heard O
him O
not O
: O
his O
thoughts O
were O
elsewhere O
: O
now O
glowing O
, O
maddening O
, O
upon O
the O
contemplation O
of O
the O
enchanting O
Rebecca S-PERSON
: O
anon O
shrinking O
guiltily O
before O
the O
vision O
of O
the O
jealous O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
with O
his O
curling O
, O
fierce O
mustachios O
, O
and O
his O
terrible O
duelling O
pistols O
loaded O
and O
cocked O
. O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
appearance O
struck O
Amelia S-PERSON
with O
terror O
, O
and O
made O
her O
shrink O
back O
. O
It O
recalled O
her O
to O
the O
world O

the O
remembrance O
of O
yesterday S-DATE

In O
the O
overpowering O
fears O

Until O
this O
dauntless O

broke O
the O
spell O

lifted O
the O
latch O

forborne O
to O
enter O

How O
long O

that O
poor O

been O
on O
her O
knees O

what O
hours O

out O

After O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
movement O
of O
terror O
in O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
mind O
— O
when O
Rebecca’s O
green O
eyes O
lighted O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
rustling O
in O
her O
fresh O
silks O
and O
brilliant O
ornaments O
, O
the O
latter O
tripped O
up O
with O
extended O
arms O
to O
embrace O
her O
— O
a O
feeling O
of O
anger O
succeeded O
, O
and O
from O
being O
deadly O
pale O
before O
, O
her O
face O
flushed O
up O
red O
, O
and O
she O
returned O
Rebecca’s O
look O
after O
a O
moment O
with O
a O
steadiness O
which O
surprised O
and O
somewhat O
abashed O
her O
rival O
. O
“ O
Dearest O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
very O
unwell O
, O
” O
the O
visitor O
said O
, O
putting O
forth O
her O
hand O
to O
take O
Amelia’s O
. O
“ O
What O
is O
it O
? O
I O
could O
not O
rest O
until O
I O
knew O
how O
you O
were O

” O
Amelia S-PERSON
drew O
back O
her O
hand O
— O
never O
since O
her O
life O
began O

that O
gentle O
soul O
refused O

answer O
any O
demonstration O
of O
good O

But O
she O
drew O
back O
her O
hand O

trembled O
all O
over O
. O
“ O
Why O
are O
you O
here O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
? O
” O
she O
said O
, O
still O
looking O
at O
her O
solemnly O
with O
her O
large O
eyes O
. O
These O
glances O
troubled O
her O
visitor O

“ O

down O

down O

day O

” O
“ O
I O
— O
I O
never O
came O
here O
, O
” O
interposed O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
with O
unlucky O
truth O
. O
“ O
No O
. O
You O
didn’t O
come O
. O
You O
took O
him O
away O
. O
Are O
you O
come O
to O
fetch O
him O
from O
me O
? O
” O
she O
continued O
in O
a O
wilder O
tone O
. O
“ O
He O
was O
here O
, O
but O
he O
is O
gone O
now O
. O
There O
on O
that O
very O
sofa O
he O
sate O
. O
Don’t O
touch O
it O
. O
We O
sate O
and O
talked O
there O
. O
I O
was O
on O
his O
knee O
, O
and O
my O
arms O
were O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
we O
said O
‘ O
Our O
Father O
. O
’ O
Yes O
, O
he O
was O
here O
: O
and O
they O
came O
and O
took O
him O
away O
, O

he O
promised O
me O
to O
come O
back O

” O
“ O
He O
will O
come O
back O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
touched O
in O
spite O
of O
herself O
. O
“ O
Look O
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
“ O
this O
is O
his O
sash O
— O
isn’t O
it O
a O
pretty O
colour O
? O
” O
and O
she O
took O
up O
the O
fringe O
and O
kissed O
it O
. O
She O
had O
tied O
it O
round O
her O
waist O
at O
some O
part O
of O
the O
day O
. O
She O
had O
forgotten O
her O
anger O
, O
her O
jealousy O
, O
the O
very O
presence O
of O
her O
rival O
seemingly O
. O
For O
she O
walked O
silently O
and O
almost O
with O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
face O
, O
towards O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
began O
to O
smooth O
down O
George’s S-PRODUCT
pillow O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
walked O
, O
too O
, O
silently O
away O
. O
“ O
How O
is O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
” O
asked O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
who O
still O
held O
his O
position O
in O
the O
chair O
. O
“ O
There O
should O
be O
somebody O
with O
her O
, O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
think O
she O
is O
very O
unwell O

” O
and O
she O
went O
away O
with O
a O
very O
grave O
face O
, O
refusing O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
entreaties O
that O
she O
would O
stay O
and O
partake O
of O
the O
early O
dinner O
which O
he O
had O
ordered O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
of O
a O
good O
- O
natured O
and O
obliging O
disposition O
| | O
and O
she O
liked O
Amelia S-PERSON
rather O
than O
otherwise O
. O
Even O
her O
hard O
words O
, O
reproachful O
as O
they O
were O
, O
were O
complimentary O
— O
the O
groans O
of O
a O
person O
stinging O
under O
defeat O
. O
Meeting O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
, O
whom O
the O
Dean’s S-PERSON
sermons O
had O
by O
no O
means O
comforted O
, O
and O
who O
was O
walking O
very O
disconsolately O
in O
the O
Parc S-FAC
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
accosted O
the O
latter O
, O
rather O
to O
the O
surprise O
of O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
, O
who O
was O
not O
accustomed O
to O
such O
marks O
of O
politeness O
from O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
and O
informing O
her O
that O
poor O
little O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
in O
a O
desperate O
condition O
, O
and O
almost O
mad O
with O
grief O
, O
sent O
off O
the O
good O
- O
natured O
Irishwoman O
straight O
to O
see O
if O
she O
could O
console O
her O
young O
favourite O
. O
“ O
I’ve O
cares O
of O
my O
own O
enough O
, O
” O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
said O
, O
gravely O
, O
“ O
and O
I O
thought O
poor O
Amelia S-PERSON
would O
be O
little O
wanting O
for O
company O
this B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
But O
if O
she’s O
so O
bad O
as O
you O
say O
, O
and O
you O
can’t O
attend O
to O
her O
, O
who O
used O
to O
be O
so O
fond O
of O
her O
, O
faith O
I’ll O
see O
if O
I O
can O
be O

And O
so O
good O
marning O
to O
ye O

Madam S-PERSON

” O
with O
which O
speech O
and O
a O
toss O
of O
her O
head O
the O
lady O
of O
the O
repayther O
took O
a O
farewell O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
whose O
company O
she O
by O
no O
means O
courted O

Becky S-PERSON
watched O
her O
marching O
off O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
lip O
. O
She O
had O
the O
keenest O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
and O
the O
Parthian S-NORP
look O
which O
the O
retreating O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
flung O
over O
her O
shoulder O
almost O
upset O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
gravity O
. O
“ O
My O
service O
to O
ye O
, O
me O
fine O
Madam O

I’m O
glad O
to O
see O
ye O
so O
cheerful O

thought O
Peggy S-PERSON
. O
“ O
It’s O
not O
you O
that O
will O
cry O
your O
eyes O
out O
with O
grief O

anyway O

” O
And O
with O
this O
she O
passed O
on O
, O
and O
speedily O
found O
her O
way O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
lodgings O
. O
The O
poor O
soul O
was O
still O
at O
the O
beside O
where O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
left O
her O
, O
and O
stood O
almost O
crazy O
with O
grief O
. O
The O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
, O
a O
strong O
- O
minded O
woman O
, O
endeavoured O
her O
best O
to O
comfort O
her O
young O
friend O
. O
“ O
You O
must O
bear O
up O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
dear O

” O
she O
said O
kindly O
, O
“ O
for O

mustn’t O
find O
you O
ill O
when O
he O
sends O

It’s O
not O

Amelia S-PERSON
said O
. O
She O
knew O
her O
own O
weakness O
well O
enough O

The O
presence O
of O
the O
more O
resolute O
friend O
checked O
it O
, O
however O

and O
she O
was O
the O
better O
of O
this O
control O

company O

They O
went O
on O
until O
two B-TIME

their O
hearts O
were O
with O
the O

Dreadful O
doubt O

anguish O
— O
prayers O

fears O

griefs O
unspeakable O
— O
followed O
the O

It O

the O
women’s O
tribute O
to O

It O

takes O
the O

the O

At O
half B-DATE

past I-DATE

an O

occurred O
of O
daily O
importance O
to O
Mr. O

: O
the O
dinner O
- O
hour O
arrived O

Warriors O
may O
fight O

but O
he O
must O
dine O
. O
He O
came O
into O
Amelia’s O
room O
to O
see O
if O
he O
could O
coax O
her O
to O
share O
that O
meal O
. O
“ O
Try O

said O

“ O
the O

Do O
try O

Emmy O

he O
kissed O
her O
hand O

Except O
when O
she O
was O
married O

he O
had O
not O
done O
so O
much O
for O
years S-DATE

“ O
You O
are O
very O
good O

Joseph S-PERSON

she O
said O

“ O
Everybody O

” O
The O
savour O
of O
the O
soup O
, O
however O
, O
was O
agreeable O
to O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd’s S-PERSON
nostrils O
: O
and O
she O
thought O
she O
would O
bear O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
company O
. O
So O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
sate O
down O
to O
their O
meal O
. O
“ O
God O
bless O
the O

said O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
, O
solemnly O
: O
she O
was O
thinking O
of O
her O
honest O
Mick S-PERSON

riding O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O

she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
sigh O

then O
, O
like O
a O
philosopher O
, O
fell O
to O
. O
Jos’s S-PERSON
spirits O
rose O
with O
his O
meal O

He O
would O
drink O
the O
regiment’s O
health O

or O
, O
indeed O
, O
take O
any O
other O

to O
indulge O
in O
a O
glass O
of O
champagne O

“ O

But O
all O

a O
sudden O

Isidor S-PERSON

the O
Major’s S-PERSON

laid O
down O

The O
windows O

looked O
southward O

a O
dull O
distant O
sound O
came O
over O
the O
sun-lighted O
roofs O
from O

“ O
What O

Jos’s S-PERSON
face O
grew O
paler O
and O
paler O
. O
Alarm O
began O
to O
take O
entire O
possession O
of O
the O
stout O
civilian O
. O
All O
the O
champagne O
he O
drank O
brought O
no O
courage O
to O
him O
. O
Before O
sunset O
he O
was O
worked O
up O
to O
such O
a O
pitch O
of O
nervousness O
as O
gratified O
his O
friend O
Isidor S-PERSON
to O
behold O
, O
who O
now O
counted O
surely O
upon O
the O
spoils O
of O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
laced O
coat O
. O
The O
women O
were O
away O
all O
this O
time O
. O
After O
hearing O
the O
firing O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
the O
stout O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
bethought O
her O
of O
her O
friend O
in O
the O
next O
chamber O
, O
and O
ran O
in O
to O
watch O
, O
and O
if O
possible O
to O
console O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
The O
idea O
that O
she O
had O
that O
helpless O
and O
gentle O
creature O
to O
protect O
, O
gave O
additional O
strength O
to O
the O
natural O
courage O
of O
the O
honest O
Irishwoman S-NORP
. O
She O
passed O
five B-TIME
hours E-TIME
by O
her O
friend’s O
side O
, O
sometimes O
in O
remonstrance O
, O
sometimes O
talking O
cheerfully O
, O
oftener O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
terrified O
mental O
supplication O
. O
“ O
I O
never O
let O
go O
her O
hand O
once O
, O
” O
said O
the O
stout O
lady O
afterwards O
, O
“ O
until O
after O
sunset O
, O
when O
the O
firing O
was O
over O
. O
” O
Pauline S-PERSON
, O
the O
bonne O
, O
was O
on O
her O
knees O
at O
church O
hard O
by O
, O
praying O
for O
son O
homme O
à O
elle O
. O
When O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
cannonading O
was O
over O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
issued O
out O
of O
Amelia’s O
room O
into O
the O
parlour O
adjoining O
, O
where O
Jos S-PERSON
sate O
with O
two S-CARDINAL
emptied O
flasks O
, O
and O
courage O
entirely O
gone O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
he O
had O
ventured O
into O
his O
sister’s O
bed- O
room O
, O
looking O
very O
much O
alarmed O
, O
and O
as O
if O
he O
would O
say O
something O
. O
But O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
kept O
her O
place O
, O
and O
he O
went O
away O
without O
disburthening O
himself O
of O
his O
speech O
. O
He O
was O
ashamed O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
fly O
. O
But O
when O
she O
made O
her O
appearance O
in O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
where O
he O
sate O
in O
the O
twilight O
in O
the O
cheerless O
company O
of O
his O
empty O
champagne O
bottles O
, O
he O
began O
to O
open O
his O
mind O
to O
her O
. O
“ O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
hadn’t O
you O
better O
get O
Amelia S-PERSON
ready O
? O
” O
“ O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
take O
her O
out O
for O
a O
walk O
? O
” O
said O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
lady O

“ O
sure O
she’s O
too O
weak O
to O
stir O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
— O
I’ve O
ordered O
the O
carriage O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O

post O

Isidor S-PERSON
is O
gone O
for O
them O
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
continued O
. O
“ O
What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
driving O
to O
- O
night O
? O
” O
answered O
the O
lady O
. O
“ O
Isn’t O
she O
better O
on O
her O
bed O
? O
I’ve O
just O
got O
her O
to O
lie O
down O

” O
“ O
Get O
her O
up O
, O
” O
said O
Jos S-PERSON

“ O
she O
must O
get O
up O
, O
I O
say O
: O
” O
and O
he O
stamped O
his O
foot O
energetically O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
the O
horses O
are O
ordered O
— O
yes O
, O
the O
horses O

It’s O
all O
over O

and O
— O
” O
“ O
And O
what O
? O
” O
asked O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I’m O
off O
for O
Ghent S-GPE
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
answered O
. O
“ O
Everybody O

going O

there’s O
a O

” O
The O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
infinite O
scorn O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
move O
till O
O’Dowd O
gives O
me O
the O
route O

said O
she O
. O
“ O
You O
may O
go O
if O
you O

Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON

but O
, O
faith O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
I O
stop O
here O
. O
” O
“ O
She O
shall O
go O
, O
” O
said O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
with O
another O
stamp O
of O
his O
foot O
. O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
put O
herself O
with O
arms O
akimbo O
before O
the O
bed- O
room O
door O
. O
“ O
Is O
it O
her O
mother O
you’re O
going O

take O
her O

” O
she O
said O

“ O

Good O

” O
“ O
D O
— O

! O
” O
yelled O
out O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
wild O
with O
fear O
, O
rage O
, O
and O
mortification O
| | O
and O
Isidor S-PERSON
came O
in O
at O
this O
juncture O
, O
swearing O
in O
his O
turn O
. O
“ O
Pas B-WORK_OF_ART

chevaux E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
sacrebleu O

” O
hissed O
out O
the O
furious O
domestic O
. O
All O
the O
horses O
were O
gone O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
not O
the O
only O
man O
in O
Brussels S-GPE
seized O
with O
panic O
that B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
But O
Jos’s S-PERSON
fears O
, O
great O
and O
cruel O
as O
they O
were O
already O
, O
were O
destined O
to O
increase O
to O
an O
almost O
frantic O
pitch O
before O
the O
night O
was O
over O
. O
It O
has O
been O
mentioned O
, O
how O
Pauline S-PERSON
, O
the O
bonne O
, O
had O
son O
homme O
á O
elle O
also O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
army O
that O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
meet O
the O
Emperor O
Napoleon S-PERSON
. O
This O
lover O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Brussels S-GPE
, O
and O
a O
Belgian S-NORP
hussar O
. O
The O
troops O
of O
his O
nation O
signalised O
themselves O
in O
this O
war O
for O
anything O
but O
courage O
, O
and O
young O
Van B-PERSON
Cutsum E-PERSON
, O
Pauline’s S-PERSON
admirer O
, O
was O
too O
good O
a O
soldier O
to O
disobey O
his O
Colonel’s O
orders O
to O
run O
away O
. O
Whilst O
in O
garrison O
at O
Brussels S-GPE
young O
Regulus S-LOC
( O
he O
had O
been O
born O
in O
the O
revolutionary O
times O
) O
found O
his O
great O
comfort O
, O
and O
passed O
almost O
all O
his O
leisure O
moments O
, O
in O
Pauline’s S-GPE
kitchen O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
with O
pockets O
and O
holsters O
crammed O
full O
of O
good O
things O
from O
her O
larder O
, O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
leave O
of O
his O
weeping O
sweetheart O
, O
to O
proceed O
upon O
the O
campaign O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
before E-DATE
. O
As O
far O
as O
his O
regiment O
was O
concerned O
, O
this O
campaign O
was O
over O
now O
. O
They O
had O
formed O
a O
part O
of O
the O
division O
under O
the O
command O
of O
his O
Sovereign O
apparent O
, O
the O
Prince O
of O
Orange O
, O
and O
as O
respected O
length O
of O
swords O
and O
mustachios O
, O
and O
the O
richness O
of O
uniform O
and O
equipments O
, O
Regulus S-PERSON
and O
his O
comrades O
looked O
to O
be O
as O
gallant O
a O
body O
of O
men O
as O
ever O
trumpet O
sounded O
for O
. O
When O
Ney S-PERSON
dashed O
upon O
the O
advance O
of O
the O
allied O
troops O
, O
carrying O
one S-CARDINAL
position O
after O
the O
other O
, O
until O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
great O
body O
of O
the O
British S-NORP
army O
from O
Brussels S-GPE
changed O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
combat O
of O
Quatre B-ORG
Bras E-ORG
, O
the O
squadrons O
among O
which O
Regulus S-PRODUCT
rode O
showed O
the O
greatest O
activity O
in O
retreating O
before O
the O
French S-NORP
, O
and O
were O
dislodged O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
post O
and O
another O
which O
they O
occupied O
with O
perfect O
alacrity O
on O
their O
part O
. O
Their O
movements O
were O
only O
checked O
by O
the O
advance O
of O
the O
British S-NORP
in O
their O
rear O
. O
Thus O
forced O
to O
halt O
, O
the O
enemy’s O
cavalry O
( O
whose O
bloodthirsty O
obstinacy O
cannot O
be O
too O
severely O
reprehended O
) O
, O
had O
at O
length O
an O
opportunity O
of O
coming O
to O
close O
quarters O
with O
the O
brave O
Belgians S-NORP
before O
them O
| | O
who O
preferred O
to O
encounter O
the O
British S-NORP
rather O
than O
the O
French S-NORP
, O
and O
at O
once O
turning O
tail O
rode O
through O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
regiments O
that O
were O
behind O
them O
, O
and O
scattered O
in O
all O
directions O
. O
The O
regiment O
in O
fact O
did O
not O
exist O
any O
more O
. O
It O
was O
nowhere O
. O
It O
had O
no O
head O
- O
quarters O
. O
Regulus O
found O
himself O
galloping O
many O
miles O
from O
the O
field O
of O
action O
, O
entirely O
alone O
| | O
and O
whither O
should O
he O
fly O
for O
refuge O
so O
naturally O
as O
to O
that O
kitchen O
and O
those O
faithful O
arms O
in O
which O
Pauline S-PERSON
had O
so O
often O
welcomed O
him O
? O
At O
some B-TIME
ten I-TIME
o’clock E-TIME
the O
clinking O
of O
a O
sabre O
might O
have O
been O
heard O
up O
the O
stair O
of O
the O
house O
where O
the O
Osbornes S-PERSON
occupied O
a O
storey O
in O
the O
continental O
fashion O
. O
A O
knock O
might O
have O
been O
heard O
at O
the O
kitchen O
door O
| | O
and O
poor O
Pauline S-PERSON
, O
come O
back O
from O
church O
, O
fainted O
almost O
with O
terror O
as O
she O
opened O
it O
and O
saw O
before O
her O
her O
haggard O
hussar O
. O
He O
looked O
as O
pale O
as O
the O
midnight O
dragoon O
who O
came O
to O
disturb O
Leonora S-PERSON
. O
Pauline S-PERSON
would O
have O
screamed O
, O
but O
that O
her O
cry O
would O
have O
called O
her O
masters O
, O
and O
discovered O
her O
friend O
. O
She O
stifled O
her O
scream O
, O
then O
, O
and O
leading O
her O
hero O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
gave O
him O
beer O
, O
and O
the O
choice O
bits O
from O
the O
dinner O
, O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
not O
had O
the O
heart O
to O
taste O
. O
The O
hussar O
showed O
he O
was O
no O
ghost O
by O
the O
prodigious O
quantity O
of O
flesh O
and O
beer O
which O
he O
devoured O
— O
and O
during O
the O
mouthfuls O
he O
told O
his O
tale O
of O
disaster O
. O
His O
regiment O
had O
performed O
prodigies O
of O
courage O
, O
and O
had O
withstood O
for O
a O
while O
the O
onset O
of O
the O
whole O
French S-NORP
army O
. O
But O
they O
were O
overwhelmed O
at O
last O
, O
as O
was O
the O
whole O
British S-NORP
army O
by O
this O
time O
. O
Ney S-PERSON
destroyed O
each O
regiment O
as O
it O
came O
up O
. O
The O
Belgians S-NORP
in O
vain O
interposed O
to O
prevent O
the O
butchery O
of O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
. O
The O
Brunswickers S-PERSON
were O
routed O
and O
had O
fled O
— O
their O
Duke S-PERSON
was O
killed O
. O
It O
was O
a O
general O
débâcle O
. O
He O
sought O
to O
drown O
his O
sorrow O
for O
the O
defeat O
in O
floods O
of O
beer O
. O
Isidor S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
come O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
heard O
the O
conversation O
and O
rushed O
out O
to O
inform O
his O
master O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
all O
over O
, O
” O
he O
shrieked O
to O
Jos S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Milor B-PERSON
Duke E-PERSON
is O
a O
prisoner O
| | O
the B-PERSON
Duke I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Brunswick E-PERSON
is O
killed O

the O
British S-NORP
army O

in O
full O
flight O

there O
is O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
man O
escaped O

and O
he O
is O
in O
the O
kitchen O
now O
— O
come O
and O
hear O
him O
. O
” O
So O
Jos S-PERSON
tottered O
into O
that O
apartment O
where O
Regulus S-LOC
still O
sate O
on O
the O
kitchen O
table O
, O
and O
clung O
fast O
to O
his O
flagon O
of O
beer O
. O
In O
the O
best O
French S-NORP
which O
he O
could O
muster O
, O
and O
which O
was O
in O
sooth O
of O
a O
very O
ungrammatical O
sort O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
besought O
the O
hussar O
to O
tell O
his O
tale O
. O
The O
disasters O
deepened O
as O
Regulus S-PERSON
spoke O
. O
He O
was O
the O
only O
man O
of O
his O
regiment O
not O
slain O
on O
the O
field O
. O
He O
had O
seen O
the B-FAC
Duke I-FAC
of I-FAC
Brunswick E-FAC
fall O
, O
the O
black O
hussars O
fly O
, O
and O
the O
Ecossais S-PRODUCT
pounded O
down O
by O
the O
cannon O
. O
“ O
And O
the O
— O
th O
? O
” O
gasped O
Jos. O
“ O
Cut O
in O
pieces O
, O
” O
said O
the O
hussar O
— O
upon O
which O
Pauline S-PERSON
cried O
out O
, O
“ O
O O
my O
mistress O
, O
ma O
bonne O
petite O
dame O
, O
” O
went O
off O
fairly O
into O
hysterics O
, O
and O
filled O
the O
house O
with O
her O
screams O
. O
Wild O
with O
terror O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
knew O
not O
how O
or O
where O
to O
seek O
for O
safety O
. O
He O
rushed O
from O
the O
kitchen O
back O
to O
the O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
and O
cast O
an O
appealing O
look O
at O
Amelia’s O
door O
, O
which O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
had O
closed O
and O
locked O
in O
his O
face O
| | O
but O
he O
remembered O
how O
scornfully O
the O
latter O
had O
received O
him O
, O
and O
after O
pausing O
and O
listening O
for O
a O
brief O
space O
at O
the O
door O
, O
he O
left O
it O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
go O
into O
the O
street O
, O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
that O
day O
. O
So O
, O
seizing O
a O
candle O
, O
he O
looked O
about O
for O
his O
gold O
- O
laced O
cap O
, O
and O
found O
it O
lying O
in O
its O
usual O
place O
, O
on O
a O
console O
- O
table O
, O
in O
the O
anteroom O
, O
placed O
before O
a O
mirror O
at O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
used O
to O
coquet O
, O
always O
giving O
his O
side O
- O
locks O
a O
twirl O
, O
and O
his O
cap O
the O
proper O
cock O
over O
his O
eye O
, O
before O
he O
went O
forth O
to O
make O
appearance O
in O
public O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
force O
of O
habit O
, O
that O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O
terror O
he O
began O
mechanically O
to O
twiddle O
with O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
arrange O
the O
cock O
of O
his O
hat O
. O
Then O
he O
looked O
amazed O
at O
the O
pale O
face O
in O
the O
glass O
before O
him O
, O
and O
especially O
at O
his O
mustachios O
, O
which O
had O
attained O
a O
rich O
growth O
in O
the O
course O
of O
near O
seven B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
since O
they O
had O
come O
into O
the O
world O
. O
They O
will O
mistake O
me O
for O
a O
military O
man O
thought O
he O
, O
remembering O
Isidor’s S-PERSON
warning O
, O
as O
to O
the O
massacre O
with O
which O
all O
the O
defeated O
British S-NORP
army O
was O
threatened O
| | O
and O
staggering O
back O
to O
his O
bed- O
chamber O
, O
he O
began O
wildly O
pulling O
the O
bell O
which O
summoned O
his O
valet O
. O
Isidor S-PERSON
answered O
that O
summons O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
sunk O
in O
a O
chair O
— O
he O
had O
torn O
off O
his O
neckcloths O
, O
and O
turned O
down O
his O
collars O
, O
and O
was O
sitting O
with O
both O
his O
hands O
lifted O
to O
his O
throat O
. O
“ O
Coupez B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
moi E-PERSON
, O
Isidor S-PERSON
, O
” O
shouted O
he O
| | O
“ O
vite O
! O
Coupez- O
moi O
! O
” O
Isidor S-PERSON
thought O
for O
a O
moment O
he O
had O
gone O
mad O
, O
and O
that O
he O
wished O
his O
valet O
to O
cut O
his O
throat O
. O
“ O
Les O
moustaches O
” O
gasped O
Jos S-PERSON
| | O
“ O
les O
moustaches O
— O
coupy O
, O
rasy O
, O
vite O
! O
— O
his O
French S-LANGUAGE
was O
of O
this O
sort O
— O
voluble O
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O
but O
not O
remarkable O
for O
grammar O
. O
Isidor S-PERSON
swept O
off O
the O
mustachios O
in O
no O
time O
with O
the O
razor O
, O
and O
heard O
with O
inexpressible O
delight O
his O
master’s O
orders O
that O
he O
should O
fetch O
a O
hat O
and O
a O
plain O
coat O
. O
“ O
Ne O

” O
— O
were O
Jos’s O
words O
, O
— O
the O
coat O
and O
cap O
were O
at O
last O
his O
property O
. O
This O
gift O
being O
made O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
selected O
a O
plain O
black O
coat O
and O
waistcoat O
from O
his O
stock O
, O
and O
put O
on O
a O
large O
white O
neck O
- O
cloth O
, O
and O
a O
plain O
beaver O
. O
If O
he O
could O
have O
got O
a O
shovelhat O
he O
would O
have O
worn O
it O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
you O
would O
have O
fancied O
he O
was O
a O
flourishing O
, O
large O
parson O
of O
the B-ORG
Church I-ORG
of I-ORG
England E-ORG
. O
“ O
Venny S-PERSON
maintenong O

” O
he O
continued O
, O
“ O
sweevy O
— O
ally O
— O
party O
— O
dong O
la O
roo O
. O
” O
And O
so O
having O
said O
, O
he O
plunged O
swiftly O
down O
the O
stairs O
of O
the O
house O
and O
passed O
into O
the O
street O
. O
Although O
Regulus S-ORG
had O
vowed O
that O
he O
was O
the O
only O
man O
of O
his O
regiment O
or O
of O
the O
allied O
army O
, O
almost O
, O
who O
had O
escaped O
being O
cut O
to O
pieces O
by O
Ney S-PERSON
, O
it O
appeared O
that O
his O
statement O
was O
incorrect O
, O
and O
that O
a O
good O
number O
more O
of O
the O
supposed O
victims O
had O
survived O
the O
massacre O
. O
Many O
scores O
of O
Regulus’s S-NORP
comrades O
had O
found O
their O
way O
back O
to O
Brussels S-GPE
, O
and O
— O
all O
agreeing O
that O
they O
had O
run O
away O
— O
filled O
the O
whole O
town O
with O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
defeat O
of O
the O
allies O
. O
The O
arrival O
of O
the O
French S-NORP
was O
expected O
hourly O
| | O
the O
panic O
continued O
, O
and O
preparations O
for O
flight O
went O
on O
everywhere O
. O
No O
horses O
! O
thought O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
in O
terror O
. O
He O
made O
Isidor S-PERSON
inquire O
of O
scores O
of O
persons O
, O
whether O
they O
had O
any O
to O
lend O
or O
sell O
, O
and O
his O
heart O
sank O
within O
him O
, O
at O
the O
negative O
answers O
returned O
everywhere O
. O
Should O
he O
take O
the O
journey O
on O
foot O
? O
Even O
fear O
could O
not O
render O
that O
ponderous O
body O
so O
active O
. O
Almost O
all O
the O
hotels O
occupied O
by O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
in O
Brussels S-GPE
face O
the O
Parc S-FAC
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
wandered O
irresolutely O
about O
in O
this B-DATE
quarter E-DATE
, O
with O
crowds O
of O
other O
people O
, O
oppressed O
as O
he O
was O
by O
fear O
and O
curiosity O
. O
Some O
families O
he O
saw O
more O
happy O
than O
himself O
, O
having O
discovered O
a O
team O
of O
horses O
, O
and O
rattling O
through O
the O
streets O
in O
retreat O
| | O
others O
again O
there O
were O
whose O
case O
was O
like O
his O
own O
, O
and O
who O
could O
not O
for O
any O
bribes O
or O
entreaties O
procure O
the O
necessary O
means O
of O
flight O
. O
Amongst O
these O
would O
- O
be O
fugitives O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
remarked O
the B-PERSON
Lady I-PERSON
Bareacres E-PERSON
and O
her O
daughter O
, O
who O
sate O
in O
their O
carriage O
in O
the O
porte O
- O
cochère O
of O
their O
hotel O
, O
all O
their O
imperials O
packed O
, O
and O
the O
only O
drawback O
to O
whose O
flight O
was O
the O
same O
want O
of O
motive O
power O
which O
kept O
Jos S-PERSON
stationary O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
occupied O
apartments O
in O
this O
hotel O
| | O
and O
had O
before O
this O
period O
had O
sundry O
hostile O
meetings O
with O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
Bareacres S-PERSON
family O
. O
My O
lady O
Bareacres S-PERSON
cut O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
on O
the O
stairs O
when O
they O
met O
by O
chance O
| | O
and O
in O
all O
places O
where O
the O
latter’s O
name O
was O
mentioned O
, O
spoke O
perseveringly O
ill O
of O
her O
neighbour O
. O
The O
Countess S-PERSON
was O
shocked O
at O
the O
familiarity O
of O
General O
Tufto S-PERSON
with O
the O
aide O
- O
de O
- O
camp’s O
wife O
. O
The B-PERSON
Lady I-PERSON
Blanche E-PERSON
avoided O
her O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
an O
infectious O
disease O
. O
Only O
the O
Earl S-PERSON
himself O
kept O
up O
a O
sly O
occasional O
acquaintance O
with O
her O
, O
when O
out O
of O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
his O
ladies O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
her O
revenge O
now O
upon O
these O
insolent O
enemies O
. O
It O
became O
known O
in O
the O
hotel O
that O
Captain O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
horses O
had O
been O
left O
behind O
, O
and O
when O
the O
panic O
began O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres E-PERSON
condescended O
to O
send O
her O
maid O
to O
the O
Captain’s O
wife O
with O
her O
Ladyship’s O
compliments O
, O
and O
a O
desire O
to O
know O
the O
price O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
horses O
. O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
returned O
a O
note O
with O
her O
compliments O
, O
and O
an O
intimation O
that O
it O
was O
not O
her O
custom O
to O
transact O
bargains O
with O
ladies’ O
maids O
. O
This O
curt O
reply O
brought O
the O
Earl O
in O
person O
to O
Becky’s S-PERSON
apartment O
: O
but O
he O
could O
get O
no O
more O
success O
than O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
ambassador O
. O
“ O
Send O
a O
lady’s O
maid O
to O
me O
! O
” O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
cried O
in O
great O
anger O
| | O
“ O
why O
didn’t O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres E-PERSON
tell O
me O
to O
go O
and O
saddle O
the O
horses O
! O
Is O
it O
her O
Ladyship O
that O
wants O
to O
escape O
, O
or O
her O
ladyship’s O
femme O
de O
chambre O
? O
” O
And O
this O
was O
all O
the O
answer O
that O
the O
Earl S-PERSON
bore O
back O
to O
his O
Countess S-PERSON
. O
What O
will O
not O
necessity O
do O
? O
The O
Countess S-PERSON
herself O
actually O
came O
to O
wait O
upon O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
on O
the O
failure O
of O
her O
second S-ORDINAL
envoy O
. O
She O
entreated O
her O
to O
name O
her O
own O
price O

she O
even O
offered O
to O
invite O
Becky S-PERSON
to O
Bareacres B-FAC
House E-FAC
, O
if O
the O
latter O
would O
but O
give O
her O
the O
means O
of O
returning O
to O
that O
residence O
. O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
sneered O
at O
her O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
want O
to O
be O
waited O
on O
by O
bailiffs O
in O
livery O

” O
she O
said O

“ O
you O
will O
never O

most O
probably O

The O
French S-NORP

those O

They O
will O
be O
here O
in O
two B-TIME

I O
shall O
be O
half O

Ghent S-GPE
by O
that O
time O

I O
would O
not O

you O
my O

not O
for O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

diamonds O
that O
your O
Lady O
ship O
wore O
at O
the O
ball O

” O
Lady O
Bareacres S-PERSON
trembled O
with O
rage O
and O
terror O
. O
The O
diamonds O
were O
sewed O
into O
her O
habit O
, O

secreted O
in O
my O
Lord’s O
padding O

boots O

“ O
Woman O

the O
diamonds O

at O
the O
banker’s O

and O
I O
will O
have O
the O
horses O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
laughed O
in O
her O
face O
. O
The O
infuriate O
Countess S-PERSON
went O
below O

and O
sate O
in O
her O
carriage O

her O
maid O

with O
her O
husband O

without O

Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
her O
Ladyship O
in O
the O
horseless O
carriage O
, O
and O
keeping O
her O
eyes O
fixed O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
bewailing O
, O
in O
the O
loudest O
tone O
of O
voice O
, O
the O
Countess’s O
perplexities O
. O
“ O
Not O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
horses O
! O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
and O
to O
have O
all O
those O
diamonds O
sewed O
into O
the O
carriage O
cushions O
! O
What O
a O
prize O
it O
will O
be O
for O
the O
French S-NORP
when O
they O
come O
! O

the O
carriage O

the O
diamonds O
, O
I O
mean O

not O
the O
lady O
! O
” O
She O
gave O
this O
information O
to O
the O
landlord O
, O
to O
the O
servants O
, O
to O
the O
guests O
, O
and O
the O
innumerable O
stragglers O
about O
the O
courtyard O
. O
Lady O
Bareacres S-PERSON
could O
have O
shot O
her O
form O
the O
carriage O
window O
. O
It O
was O
while O
enjoying O
the O
humiliation O
of O
her O
enemy O
that O
Rebeca S-PERSON
caught O
sight O
of O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
who O
made O
towards O
her O
directly O
he O
perceived O
her O
. O
That O
altered O
, O
frightened O
, O
fat O
face O
, O
told O
his O
secret O
well O
enough O
. O
He O
too O
wanted O
to O
fly O
, O
and O
was O
on O
the O
look O
- O
out O
for O
the O
means O
of O
escape O
. O
“ O
He O
shall O
buy O
my O
horses O
, O
” O
thought O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
“ O
and O
I’ll S-PERSON
ride O
the O
mare O
. O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
walked O
up O
to O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
put O
the O
question O
for O
the O
hundredth S-ORDINAL
time O
during O
the B-TIME
past I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
“ O
Did O
she O
know O
where O
horses O
were O
to O
be O
had O
? O
” O
“ O
What O
, O
you O
fly O
? O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
. O
“ O
I O
thought O
you O
were O
the O
champion O
of O
all O
the O
ladies O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
. O
” O
“ O
I O
— O
I’m O
not O
a O
military O
man O
, O
” O
gasped O
he O
. O
“ O
And O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
— O
Who O
in O
to O
protect O
that O
poor O
little O
sister O
of O
yours O
? O
” O
asked O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
You O
surely O
would O
not O
desert O
her O
? O
” O
“ O
What O
good O
can O
I O
do O
her O
, O
suppose O
— O
suppose O
the O
enemy O
arrive O
? O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
answered O
. O
“ O
They’ll O
spare O
the O
women O
| | O
but O
my O
man O
tells O
me O
that O
they O
have O
taken O
an O
oath O
to O
give O
no O
quarter O
to O
the O
men O
— O
the O
dastardly O
cowards O
. O
” O
“ O
Horrid O
! O
” O
cried O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
enjoying O
his O
perplexity O
. O
“ O
Besides O
, O
I O
don’t O
want O
to O
desert O
her O
, O
” O
cried O
the O
brother O
. O
“ O
She O
shan’t O
be O
deserted O
. O
There O
is O
a O
seat O
for O
her O
in O
my O
carriage O
, O
and O
one O
for O
you O
, O
dear O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
will O
come O

and O
if O
we O
can O
get O
horses O
— O
” O
sighed O
he O
— O
“ O
I O
have O
two S-CARDINAL
to O
sell O
” O
the O
lady O
said O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
could O
have O
flung O
himself O
into O
her O
arms O
at O
the O
news O
. O
“ O
Get O
the O
carriage O
, O
Isidor S-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
cried O
: O
“ O
we’ve O
found O
them O
— O
we O
have O
found O
them O
. O
” O
“ O
My O
horses O
never O
were O
in O
harness O
, O
” O
added O
the O
lady O
. O
“ O
Bullfinch S-PERSON
would O
kick O
the O
carriage O
to O
pieces O
, O
if O
you O
put O
him O
in O
the O
traces O
. O
” O
“ O
But O
he O
is O
quiet O
to O
ride O
? O
” O
asked O
the O
civilian O
. O
“ O
As O
quiet O
as O
a O
lamb O
, O
and O
as O
fast O
as O
a O
hare O
, O
” O
answered O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
think O
he O
is O
up O
to O
my O
weight O
? O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
said O
. O
He O
was O
already O
on O
his O
back O
, O
in O
imagination O
, O
without O
ever O
so O
much O
as O
a O
thought O
for O
poor O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
What O
person O
who O
loved O
a O
horse O
- O
speculation O
could O
resist O
such O
a O
temptation O
? O
In O
reply O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
asked O
him O
to O
come O
into O
her O
room O
, O
whither O
he O
followed O
her O
quite O
breathless O
to O
conclude O
the O
bargain O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
seldom O
spent O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
- I-TIME
hour E-TIME
in O
his O
life O
which O
cost O
him O
so O
much O
money O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
measuring O
the O
value O
of O
the O
goods O
which O
she O
had O
for O
sale O
by O
Jos’s S-PERSON
eagerness O
to O
purchase O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
scarcity O
of O
the O
article O
, O
put O
upon O
her O
horses O
a O
price O
so O
prodigious O
as O
to O
make O
even O
the O
civilian O
draw O
back O
. O
“ O
She O
would O
sell O
both O
or O
neither O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
resolutely O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
ordered O
her O
not O
to O
part O
with O
them O
, O
for O
a O
price O
less O
than O
that O
which O
she O
specified O
. O
Lord O
Bareacres S-PERSON
below O
would O
give O
her O
the O
same O
money O
— O
and O
with O
all O
her O
love O
and O
regard O
for O
the O
Sedley S-PERSON
family O
, O
her O
dear O
Mr. O
Joseph S-PERSON
must O
conceive O
that O
poor O
people O
must O
live O
— O
nobody O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
could O
be O
more O
affectionate O
, O
but O
more O
firm O
about O
the O
matter O
of O
business O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
ended O
by O
agreeing O
, O
as O
might O
be O
supposed O
of O
him O
. O
The O
sum O
he O
had O
to O
give O
her O
was O
so O
large O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
ask O
for O
time O
| | O
so O
large O
as O
to O
be O
a O
little O
fortune O
to O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
who O
rapidly O
calculated O
that O
with O
this O
sum O
, O
and O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
residue O
of O
Rawdon’s O
effects O
, O
and O
her O
pension O
as O
a O
widow O
should O
he O
fall O
, O
she O
would O
now O
be O
absolutely O
independent O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
might O
look O
her O
weeds O
steadily O
in O
the O
face O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
in O
the O
day O
she O
certainly O
had O
herself O
thought O
about O
flying O
. O
But O
her O
reason O
gave O
her O
better O
counsel O
. O
“ O
Suppose O
the O
French S-NORP
do O
come O
, O
” O
thought O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
“ O
what O
can O
they O
do O
to O
a O
poor O
officer’s O
widow O
? O
Bah O
! O
the O
times O
of O
sacks O
and O
sieges O
are O
over O
. O
We O
shall O
be O
let O
to O
go O
home O
quietly O
, O
or O
I O
may O
live O
pleasantly O
abroad O
with O
a O
snug O
little O
income O
. O
” O
Meanwhile O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
Isidor S-PERSON
went O
off O
to O
the O
stables O
to O
inspect O
the O
newly O
- O
purchased O
cattle O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
bade O
his O
man O
saddle O
the O
horses O
at O
once O
. O
He O
would O
ride O
away O
that B-TIME
very I-TIME
night E-TIME
, O
that B-TIME
very I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
And O
he O
left O
the O
valet O
busy O
in O
getting O
the O
horses O
ready O
, O
and O
went O
homewards O
himself O
to O
prepare O
for O
his O
departure O
. O
It O
must O
be O
secret O
. O
He O
would O
go O
to O
his O
chamber O
by O
the O
back O
entrance O
. O
He O
did O
not O
care O
to O
face O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
and O
own O
to O
them O
that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
run O
. O
By O
that O
time O
Jos’s S-PERSON
bargain O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
completed O
, O
and O
his O
horses O
had O
been O
visited O
and O
examined O
, O
it O
was O
almost O
morning O
once O
more O
. O
But O
though O
midnight S-TIME
was O
long O
passed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
rest O
for O
the O
city O
| | O
the O
people O
were O
up O
, O
the O
doors O
, O
and O
the O
streets O
were O
busy O
. O
Rumours O
of O
various O
natures O
went O
still O
from O
mouth O
to O
mouth O
: O
one S-CARDINAL
report O
averred O
that O
the O
Prussians S-NORP
had O
been O
utterly O
defeated O
| | O
another O
that O
it O
was O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
who O
had O
been O
attacked O
and O
conquered O
: O
a O
third S-ORDINAL
that O
the O
latter O
had O
held O
their O
ground O
. O
This O
last O
rumour O
gradually O
got O
strength O
. O
No O
Frenchmen S-NORP
had O
made O
their O
appearance O
. O
Stragglers O
had O
come O
in O
from O
the O
army O
bringing O
reports O
more O
and O
more O
favourable O
: O
at O
last O
an O
aide O
- O
de O
- O
camp O
actually O
reached O
Brussels S-GPE
with O
despatches O
for O
the O
Commandant O
of O
the O
place O
, O
who O
placarded O
presently O
through O
the O
town O
an O
official O
announcement O
of O
the O
success O
of O
the O
allies O
at O
Quatre B-ORG
Bras E-ORG
, O
and O
the O
entire O
repulse O
of O
the O
French S-NORP
under O
Ney S-PERSON
after O
a O
six S-CARDINAL
hours’ O
battle O
. O
The O
aide O
- O
de O
- O
camp O
must O
have O
arrived O
sometime O
while O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
were O
making O
their O
bargain O
together O
, O
or O
the O
latter O
was O
inspecting O
his O
purchase O
. O
When O
he O
reached O
his O
own O
hotel O
, O
he O
found O
a O
score O
of O
its O
numerous O
inhabitants O
on O
the O
threshold O
discoursing O
of O
the O
news O
| | O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
as O
to O
its O
truth O
. O
And O
he O
went O
up O
to O
communicate O
it O
to O
the O
ladies O
under O
his O
charge O
. O
He O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
tell O
them O
how O
he O
had O
intended O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
them O
, O
how O
he O
had O
bought O
horses O
, O
and O
what O
a O
price O
he O
had O
paid O
for O
them O
. O
But O
success O
or O
defeat O
was O
a O
minor O
matter O
to O
them O
, O
who O
had O
only O
thought O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
those O
they O
loved O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
news O
of O
the O
victory O
, O
became O
still O
more O
agitated O
even O
than O
before O
. O
She O
was O
for O
going O
that O
moment O
to O
the O
army O
. O
She O
besought O
her O
brother O
with O
tears O
to O
conduct O
her O
thither O
. O
Her O
doubts O
and O
terrors O
reached O
their O
paroxysm O
| | O
and O
the O
poor O
girl O
, O
who O
for O
many O
hours O
had O
been O
plunged O
into O
stupor O
, O
raved O
and O
ran O
hither O
and O
thither O
in O
hysteric O
insanity O
— O
a O
piteous O
sight O
. O
No O
man O
writhing O
in O
pain O
on O
the O
hard O
- O
fought O
field O
fifteen B-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
off O
, O
where O
lay O
, O
after O
their O
struggles O
, O
so O
many O
of O
the O
brave O
— O
no O
man O
suffered O
more O
keenly O
than O
this O
poor O
harmless O
victim O
of O
the O
war O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
could O
not O
bear O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
pain O
. O
He O
left O
his O
sister O
in O
the O
charge O
of O
her O
stouter O
female O
companion O
, O
and O
descended O
once O
more O
to O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
hotel O
, O
where O
everybody O
still O
lingered O
, O
and O
talked O
, O
and O
waited O
for O
more O
news O
. O
It O
grew O
to O
be O
broad O
daylight O
as O
they O
stood O
here O
, O
and O
fresh O
news O
began O
to O
arrive O
from O
the O
war O
, O
brought O
by O
men O
who O
had O
been O
actors O
in O
the O
scene O
. O
Wagons O
and O
long O
country O
carts O
laden O
with O
wounded O
came O
rolling O
into O
the O
town O

ghastly O
groans O
came O
from O
within O
them O
, O
and O
haggard O
faces O
looked O
up O
sadly O
from O
out O
of O
the O
straw O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
was O
looking O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
these O
carriages O
with O
a O
painful O
curiosity O

the O
moans O
of O
the O
people O
within O
were O
frightful O
— O
the O
wearied O
horses O
could O
hardly O
pull O
the O
cart O
. O
“ O
Stop O
! O
stop O
! O
” O
a O
feeble O
voice O
cried O
from O
the O
straw O
, O
and O
the O
carriage O
stopped O
opposite O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
hotel O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
George S-PERSON
, O
I O
know O
it O
is O
! O
” O
cried O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
rushing O
in O
a O
moment O
to O
the O
balcony O
, O
with O
a O
pallid O
face O
and O
loose O
flowing O
hair O
. O
It O
was O
not O
George S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
next O
best O
thin O
it O
was O
news O
of O
him O
. O
It O
was O
poor O
Tom B-PERSON
Stubble E-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
marched O
out O
of O
Brussels S-GPE
so O
gallantly O
twenty B-TIME
- I-TIME
four I-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
, O
bearing O
the O
colours O
of O
the O
regiment O
which O
he O
had O
defended O
very O
gallantly O
upon O
the O
field O
. O
A O
French S-NORP
lancer O
had O
speared O
the O
young O
ensign O
in O
the O
leg O
, O
who O
fell O
, O
still O
bravely O
holding O
to O
his O
flag O
. O
At O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
engagement O
, O
a O
place O
had O
been O
found O
for O
the O
poor O
boy O
in O
a O
cart O
, O
and O
he O
had O
been O
brought O
back O
to O
Brussels S-GPE

“ O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
! O
” O
cried O
the O
boy O
, O
faintly O
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
came O
up O
almost O
frightened O
at O
the O
appeal O
. O
He O
had O
not O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
distinguished O
who O
it O
was O
that O
called O
him O
. O
Little O
Tom B-PERSON
Stubble E-PERSON
held O
out O
his O
hot O
and O
feeble O
hand O
. O
“ O
I’m O
to O
be O
taken O
in O
here O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
Osborne S-PERSON
— O

Dobbin S-PERSON
said O

” O
This O
young O
fellow’s O
thoughts O
, O
during O
the O
long O
feverish O
hours O
passed O
in O
the O
cart O
, O
had O
been O
wandering O
to O
his O
father’s O
personage O
which O
he O
had O
quitted O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
and O
he O
had O
sometimes O
forgotten O
his O
pain O
in O
that O
delirium O
. O
The O
hotel O
was O
large O
, O
and O
the O
people O
kind O
, O
and O
all O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O
cart O
were O
taken O
in O
and O
placed O
on O
various O
couches O
. O
The O
young O
ensign O
was O
conveyed O
upstairs O
to O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
quarters O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
had O
rushed O
down O
to O
him O
, O
when O
the O
latter O
had O
recognized O
him O
from O
the O
balcony O
. O
You O
may O
fancy O
the O
feelings O
of O
these O
women O
when O
they O
were O
told O
that O
the O
day O
was O
over O
, O
and O
both O
their O
husbands O
were O
safe O

in O
what O
mute O
rapture O
Amelia S-PERSON
fell O
on O
her O
good O
friend’s O
neck O
, O
and O
embraced O
her O

in O
what O
a O
grateful O
passion O
of O
prayer O
she O
fell O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
and O
thanked O
the O
Power O
which O
had O
saved O
her O
husband O
. O
Our O
young O
lady O
, O
in O
her O
fevered O
and O
nervous O
condition O
, O
could O
have O
had O
no O
more O
salutary O
medicine O
prescribed O
for O
her O
by O
any O
physician O
than O
that O
which O
chance O
put O
in O
her O
way O
. O
She O
and O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
watched O
incessantly O
by O
the O
wounded O
lad O
, O
whose O
pains O
were O
very O
severe O
, O
and O
in O
the O
duty O
thus O
forced O
upon O
her O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
had O
not O
time O
to O
brood O
over O
her O
personal O
anxieties O
, O
or O
to O
give O
herself O
up O
to O
her O
own O
fears O
and O
forebodings O
after O
her O
wont O
. O
The O
young O
patient O
told O
in O
his O
simple O
fashion O
the O
events O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
the O
actions O
of O
our O
friends O
of O
the O
gallant O
— O
th O
. O
They O
had O
suffears O
severly O
. O
They O
had O
lost O
very O
many O
officers O
and O
men O
. O
The O
Major’s S-PERSON
horse O
had O
been O
shot O
under O
him O
as O
the O
regiment O
charged O
, O
and O
they O
all O
thought O
that O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
was O
gone O
, O
and O
that O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
got O
his O
majority O
, O
until O
on O
their O
return O
from O
the O
charge O
to O
their O
old O
ground O
, O
the O
Major O
was O
discovered O
seated O
on O
Pyramus’s S-PERSON
carcase O
, O
refreshing O
himself O
from O
a O
case O
- O
bottle O
. O
It O
was O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
that O
cut O
down O
the O
French S-NORP
lancer O
who O
had O
speared O
the O
ensign O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
turned O
so O
pale O
at O
the O
notion O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
stopped O
the O
young O
ensign O
in O
this O
story O
. O
And O
it O
was O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
who O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
though O
wounded O
himself O
, O
took O
up O
the O
lad O
in O
his O
arms O
and O
carried O
him O
to O
the O
surgeon O
, O
and O
thence O
to O
the O
cart O
which O
was O
to O
bring O
him O
back O
to O
Brussels S-GPE
. O
And O
it O
was O
he O
who O
promised O
the O
driver O
two S-CARDINAL
louis O
if O
he O
would O
make O
his O
way O
to O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
hotel O
in O
the O
city O

and O
tell O
Mrs. O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
that O
the O
action O
was O
over O
, O
and O
that O
her O
husband O
was O
unhurt O
and O
well O
. O
“ O
Indeed O
, O
but O
he O
has O
a O
good O
heart O
that O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
, O
” O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
said O
, O
“ O
though O
he O
is O
always O
laughing O
at O
me O
. O
” O
Young B-PERSON
Stubble E-PERSON
vowed O
there O
was O
not O
such O
another O
officer O
in O
the O
army O
, O
and O
never O
ceased O
his O
praises O
of O
the O
senior O
captain O
, O
his O
modesty O
, O
his O
kindness O
, O
and O
his O
admirable O
coolness O
in O
the O
field O
. O
To O
these O
parts O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
lent O
a O
very O
distracted O
attention O
: O
it O
was O
only O
when O
George S-PERSON
was O
spoken O
of O
that O
she O
listened O
, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
not O
mentioned O
, O
she O
thought O
about O
him O
. O
In O
tending O
her O
patient O
, O
and O
in O
thinking O
of O
the O
wonderful O
escapes O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
her O
second S-ORDINAL
day O
passed O
away O
not O
too O
slowly O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
There O
was O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
man O
in O
the O
army O
for O
her O
: O
and O
as O
long O
as O
he O
was O
well O
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
that O
its O
movements O
interested O
her O
little O
. O
All O
the O
reports O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
brought O
from O
the O
street O
fell O
very O
vaguely O
on O
her O
ears O
| | O
though O
they O
were O
sufficient O
to O
give O
that O
timorous O
gentleman O
, O
and O
many O
other O
people O
then O
in O
Brussels S-GPE
, O
every O
disquiet O
. O
The O
French S-NORP
had O
been O
repulsed O
certainly O
, O
but O
it O
was O
after O
a O
severe O
and O
doubtful O
struggle O
, O
and O
with O
only O
a O
division O
of O
the O
French S-NORP
army O
. O
The O
Emperor O
, O
with O
the O
main O
body O
, O
was O
away O
at O
Ligny S-GPE
, O
where O
he O
had O
utterly O
annihilated O
the O
Prussians S-NORP
, O
and O
was O
now O
free O
to O
bring O
his O
whole O
force O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
allies O
. O
The B-PERSON
Duke I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Wellington E-PERSON
was O
retreating O
upon O
the O
capital O
, O
and O
a O
great O
battle O
must O
be O
fought O
under O
its O
walls O
probably O
, O
of O
which O
the O
chances O
were O
more O
than O
doubtful O
. O
The B-PERSON
Duke I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Wellington E-PERSON
had O
but O
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
British S-NORP
troops O
on O
whom O
he O
could O
rely O
, O
for O
the O
Germans S-NORP
were O
raw O
militia O
, O
the O
Belgians S-NORP
disaffected O
| | O
and O
with O
his O
handful O
his O
Grace S-PERSON
had O
to O
resist O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
men O
that O
had O
broken O
into O
Belgium S-GPE
under O
Napoleon S-PERSON
. O
Under O
Napoleon S-PERSON
! O
What O
warrior O
was O
there O
, O
however O
famous O
and O
skilful O
, O
that O
could O
fight O
at O
odds O
with O
him O
? O
Jos S-PERSON
thought O
of O
all O
these O
things O
, O
and O
trembled O
. O
So O
did O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
Brussels S-GPE
— O
where O
people O
felt O
that O
the O
fight O
of O
the O
day O
before O
was O
but O
the O
prelude O
to O
the O
greater O
combat O
which O
was O
imminent O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
armies O
opposed O
to O
the O
Emperor O
was O
scattered O
to O
the O
winds O
already O
. O
The O
few O
English S-LANGUAGE
that O
could O
be O
brought O
to O
resist O
him O
would O
perish O
at O
their O
posts O
, O
and O
the O
conqueror O
would O
pass O
over O
their O
bodies O
into O
the O
city O
. O
Woe O
be O
to O
those O
whom O
he O
found O
there O
! O
Addresses O
were O
prepared O
, O
public O
functionaries O
assembled O
and O
debated O
secretly O
, O
apartments O
were O
got O
ready O
, O
and O
tricoloured O
banners O
and O
triumphal O
emblems O
manufactured O
, O
to O
welcome O
the O
arrival O
of O
His O
Majesty O
the O
Emperor O
and O
King O
. O
The O
emigration O
still O
continued O
, O
and O
wherever O
families O
could O
find O
means O
of O
departure O
, O
they O
fled O
. O
When O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
on O
the B-DATE
afternoon I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
17th I-DATE
of I-DATE
June E-DATE
, O
went O
to O
Rebecca’s B-FAC
hotel E-FAC
, O
he O
found O
that O
the O
great O
Bareacres’ S-PRODUCT
carriage O
had O
at O
length O
rolled O
away O
from O
the O
porte O
- O
cochère O
. O
The O
Earl O
had O
procured O
a O
pair O
of O
horses O
somehow O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
rolling O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Ghent S-GPE
. O
Louis B-PERSON
the I-PERSON
Desired E-PERSON
was O
getting O
ready O
his O
portmanteau O
in O
that O
city O
, O
too O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
Misfortune S-PERSON
was O
never O
tired O
of O
worrying O
into O
motion O
that O
unwieldy O
exile O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
felt O
that O
the O
delay O
of O
yesterday S-DATE
had O
been O
only O
a O
respite O
, O
and O
that O
his O
dearly O
bought O
horses O
must O
of O
a O
surety O
be O
put O
into O
requisition O
. O
His O
agonies O
were O
very O
severe O
all O
this O
day O
. O
As O
long O
as O
there O
was O
an O
English S-LANGUAGE
army O
between O
Brussels S-GPE
and O
Napoleon S-PERSON
, O
there O
was O
no O
need O
of O
immediate O
flight O
| | O
but O
he O
had O
his O
horses O
brought O
from O
their O
distant O
stables O
, O
to O
the O
stables O
in O
the O
court O
- O
yard O
of O
the O
hotel O
where O
he O
lived O
| | O
so O
that O
they O
might O
be O
under O
his O
own O
eyes O
, O
and O
beyond O
the O
risk O
of O
violent O
abduction O
. O
Isidor S-PERSON
watched O
the O
stable O
- O
door O
constantly O
, O
and O
had O
the O
horses O
saddled O
, O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
the O
start O
. O
He O
longed O
intensely O
for O
that O
event O
. O
After O
the O
reception O
of O
the B-DATE
previous I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
did O
not O
care O
to O
come O
near O
her O
dear O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
She O
clipped O
the O
bouquet O
which O
George S-PERSON
had O
brought O
her O
, O
and O
gave O
fresh O
water O
to O
the O
flowers O
, O
and O
read O
over O
the O
letter O
which O
he O
had O
sent O
her O
. O
“ O
Poor O
wretch O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
twirling O
round O
the O
little O
bit O
of O
paper O
in O
her O
fingers O
, O
“ O
how O
I O
could O
crush O
her O
with O
this O
! O
— O
and O
it O
is O
for O
a O
thing O
like O
this O
that O
she O
must O
break O
her O
heart O
, O
forsooth O

for O
a O
man O
who O
is O
stupid O

a O
coxcomb O

and O
who O
does O
not O
care O
for O
her O

My O
poor O
good O
Rawdon S-PERSON
is O
worth O
ten S-CARDINAL
of O
this O
creature O

” O
And O
then O
she O
fell O
to O
thinking O
what O
she O
should O
do O
if O
— O
if O
anything O
happened O
to O
poor O
good O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
and O
what O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
luck O
it O
was O
that O
he O
had O
left O
his O
horses O
behind O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
this O
day O
too O
, O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
who O
saw O
not O
without O
anger O
the O
Bareacres S-PERSON
party O
drive O
off O
, O
bethought O
her O
of O
the O
precaution O
which O
the O
Countess O
had O
taken O
, O
and O
did O
a O
little O
needlework O
for O
her O
own O
advantage O
| | O
she O
stitched O
away O
the O
major O
part O
of O
her O
trinkets O
, O
bills O
and O
bank O
- O
notes O
about O
her O
person O
, O
and O
so O
prepared O
, O
was O
ready O
for O
any O
event O
— O
to O
fly O
if O
she O
thought O
fit O
, O
or O
to O
stay O
and O
welcome O
the O
conqueror O
, O
were O
he O
Englishman S-NORP
or O
Frenchman S-NORP
. O
And O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
she O
did O
not O
dream O
that O
night O
of O
becoming O
a O
duchess O
and O
Madame B-PERSON
la I-PERSON
Maréchale E-PERSON
, O
while O
Rawdon S-PERSON
wrapped O
in O
his O
cloak O
, O
and O
making O
his O
bivouac O
under O
the O
rain O
at O
Mount B-FAC
Saint I-FAC
John E-FAC
, O
was O
thinking O
, O
with O
all O
the O
force O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
about O
the O
little O
wife O
whom O
he O
had O
left O
behind O
him O
. O
The B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
was O
a O
Sunday S-DATE
. O
And O
Mrs. O
Major B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
seeing O
both O
her O
patients O
refreshed O
in O
health O
and O
spirits O
by O
some O
rest O
which O
they O
had O
taken O
during O
the O
night O
. O
She O
herself O
had O
slept O
on O
a O
great O
chair O
in O
Amelia’s S-GPE
room O
, O
ready O
to O
wait O
upon O
her O
poor O
friend O
or O
the O
ensign O
, O
should O
either O
need O
her O
nursing O
. O
When O
morning O
came O
, O
this O
robust O
woman O
went O
back O
to O
the O
house O
where O
she O
and O
her O
Major O
had O
their O
billet O
| | O
and O
here O
performed O
an O
elaborate O
and O
splendid O
toilette O
, O
befitting O
the O
day O
. O
And O
it O
is O
very O
possible O
that O
whilst O
alone O
in O
that O
chamber O
, O
which O
her O
husband O
had O
inhabited O
, O
and O
where O
his O
cap O
still O
lay O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
and O
his O
cane O
stood O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
prayer O
at O
least O
was O
sent O
up O
to O
Heaven O
for O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
brave O
soldier O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON

When O
she O
returned O
she O
brought O
her O
prayer O
- O
book O
with O
her O
, O
and O
her O
uncle O
the O
Dean’s S-PERSON
famous O
book O
of O
sermons O
, O
out O
of O
which O
she O
never O
failed O
to O
read O
every O
Sabbath O

not O
understanding O
all O
, O
haply O
, O
not O
pronouncing O
many O
of O
the O
words O
aright O
, O
which O
were O
long O
and O
abstruse O
— O
for O
the O
Dean S-PERSON
was O
a O
learned O
man O
, O
and O
loved O
long O
Latin S-NORP
words O
— O
but O
with O
great O
gravity O
, O
vast O
emphasis O
, O
and O
with O
tolerable O
corrections O
in O
the O
main O
. O
How O
often O
has O
my O
Mick S-PERSON
listened O
to O
these O
sermons O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
and O
me O
reading O
in O
the O
cabin O
of O
a O
calm O

She O
proposed O
to O
resume O
this O
exercise O
on O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
the O
wounded O
ensign O
for O
a O
congregation O
. O
The O
same O
service O
was O
read O
on O
that B-DATE
day E-DATE
in O
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
churches O
at O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
hour E-TIME

and O
millions S-CARDINAL
of O
British S-NORP
men O
and O
women O
, O
on O
their O
knees O
, O
implored O
protection O
of O
the O
Father O
of O
all O
. O
They O
did O
not O
hear O
the O
noise O
which O
disturbed O
our O
little O
congregation O
at O
Brussels S-GPE
. O
Much O
louder O
than O
that O
which O
had O
interrupted O
them O
two B-DATE
days E-DATE
previously O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
was O
reading O
the O
service O
in O
her O
best O
voice O
, O
the O
cannon O
of O
Waterloo S-ORG
began O
to O
roar O
. O
When O
Jos S-PERSON
heard O
that O
dreadful O
sound O
, O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
he O
would O
bear O
this O
perpetual O
recurrence O
of O
terrors O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
would O
fly O
at O
once O
. O
He O
rushed O
into O
the O
sick O
man’s O
room O
, O
where O
our O
three S-CARDINAL
friends O
had O
paused O
in O
their O
prayers O
, O
and O
further O
interrupted O
them O
by O
a O
passionate O
appeal O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
can’t O
stand O
it O
any O
more O
, O
Emmy O
, O
” O
he O
said O

“ O
I O
won’t O
stand O
it O

and O
you O
must O
come O
with O
me O
. O
I O
have O
bought O
a O
horse O
for O
you O
— O
never O
mind O
at O
what O
price O
— O
and O
you O
must O
dress O
and O
come O
with O
me O
, O
and O
ride O
behind O
Isidor S-PERSON
. O
” O
“ O
God O
forgive O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
but O
you O
are O
no O
better O
than O
a O
coward O
, O
” O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
said O
, O
laying O
down O
the O
book O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
come O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
” O
the O
civilian O
went O
on O
| | O
“ O
never O
mind O
what O
she O
says O
| | O
why O
are O
we O
to O
stop O
here O
and O
be O
butchered O
by O
the O
Frenchmen S-NORP
? O
” O
“ O
You O
forget O
the O
— O
th O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
” O
said O
the O
little O
Stubble O
, O
the O
wounded O
hero O
, O
from O
his O
bed O
— O
“ O
and O
— O
and O
you O
won’t O
leave O
me O
, O
will O
you O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
? O
” O
“ O
No O
, O
my O
dear O
fellow O
, O
” O
said O
she O
, O
going O
up O
and O
kissing O
the O
boy O
. O
“ O
No O
harm O
shall O
come O
to O
you O
while O
I O
stand O
by O
. O
I O
don’t O
budge O
till O
I O
get O
the O
word O
from O
Mick S-PERSON
. O
A O
pretty O
figure O
I’d O
be O
, O
wouldn’t O
I O
, O
stuck O
behind O
that O
chap O
on O
a O
pillion O
? O
” O
This O
image O
caused O
the O
young O
patient O
to O
burst O
out O
laughing O
in O
his O
bed O
, O
and O
even O
made O
Amelia S-PERSON
smile O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
ask O
her O
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
shouted O
out O
— O
“ O
I O
don’t O
ask O
that O
— O
that O
Irishwoman O
, O
but O
you O
Amelia S-PERSON

once O
for O
all O

will O
you O
come O
? O
” O
“ O
Without O
my O
husband O
, O
Joseph S-PERSON
? O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
wonder O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
hand O
to O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
wife O
. O
Jos’s S-PERSON
patience O
was O
exhausted O
. O
“ O
Good O
- O
bye O
, O
then O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
shaking O
his O
fist O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
and O
slamming O
the O
door O
by O
which O
he O
retreated O
. O
And O
this O
time O
he O
really O
gave O
his O
order O
for O
march O
: O
and O
mounted O
in O
the O
courtyard O
. O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
heard O
the O
clattering O
hoofs O
of O
the O
horses O
as O
they O
issued O
from O
the O
gate O

and O
looking O
on O
, O
made O
many O
scornful O
remarks O
on O
poor O
Joseph S-PERSON
as O
he O
rode O
down O
the O
street O
with O
Isidor S-PERSON
after O
him O
in O
the O
laced O
cap O

The O
horses O
, O
which O
had O
not O
been O
exercised O
for O
some B-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
were O
lively O
, O
and O
sprang O
about O
the O
street O
. O
Joe S-PERSON
, O
a O
clumsy O
and O
timid O
horseman O
, O
did O
not O
look O
to O
advantage O
in O
the O
saddle O

“ O
Look O
at O
him O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON

into O
the O
parlour O

Such O
a O
bull O

And O
presently O
the O
pair O
of O
riders O
disappeared O
at O
a O
canter O
down O
the O
street O
leading O
in O
the O

the O
Ghent S-GPE
road O

Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
pursuing O
them O
with O
a O
fire O
of O
sarcasm O
so O
long O
as O

were O
in O

All O
that O
day O
from O
morning O
until O
past O
sunset O

the O
cannon O
never O
ceased O
to O
roar O

It O
was O
dark O
when O
the O
cannonading O
stopped O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O

All O
of O
us O
have O
read O
of O
what O
occurred O
during O
that O
interval O

The O
tale O

in O
every O

you O

Centuries O

out O

the O

All O
our O

took O
their O

fought O

All O
day O
long O

ten B-QUANTITY

the O

the O

Toward O
evening S-TIME

the O
attack O

the O
French S-NORP
, O
repeated O

resisted O
so O

They O

up O

The O
spinster O
caused O

letter O

encouraging O
him O

“ O

we O
sent O
Miss O

I O

Oh O

Bute O

why O

you O

your O
collar O

” O
Why O
, O
indeed O
? O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
, O
having O
the O
game O
in O
her O
hands O
, O
had O
really O
played O
her O
cards O
too O
well O

She O
had O
ruled O
over O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
household O
utterly O

completely O
, O
to O
be O
utterly O

completely O
routed O
when O
a O
favourable O
opportunity O
for O
rebellion O
came O
. O
She O
and O
her O
household O
, O
however O
, O
considered O
that O
she O
had O
been O
the O
victim O
of O
horrible O
selfishness O
and O
treason O
, O
and O
that O
her O
sacrifices O
in O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON

had O
met O
with O
the O
most O
savage O
ingratitude O

Rawdon’s S-PERSON
promotion O
, O
and O
the O
honourable O
mention O
made O
of O
his O

in O
the O
Gazette S-ORG

filled O
the O
good O
Christian S-NORP
lady O
also O
with O
alarm O

Would O
his O
aunt O
relent O
towards O
him O
now O
that O
he O
was O
a O
Lieutenant O

Colonel O

a O
C.B.? O

would O
that O
odious O
Rebecca S-PERSON
once O
more O
get O
into O
favour O
? O
The O
Rector’s S-PERSON
wife O
wrote O
a O
sermon O
for O
her O

about O
the O
vanity O

military O

the O
prosperity O

the O
wicked O

which O
the O

read O

without O
understanding O
one O

He O
had O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
for O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
auditors O
— O
Pitt S-PERSON

who O
had O
come O

his O
two S-CARDINAL
half O

the O
old O

Since O
the O
departure O
of O
Becky B-PERSON
Sharp E-PERSON
, O
that O
old O
wretch O
had O
given O
himself O
up O
entirely O
to O
his O
bad O
courses O
, O
to O
the O
great O
scandal O
of O
the O
county O

the O
mute O
horror O
of O
his O
son O
. O
The O
ribbons O
in O
Miss O
Horrock’s S-PERSON
cap O
became O
more O
splendid O

ever O
. O
The O
polite O
families O
fled O
the O
hall O
and O
its O
owner O
in O
terror O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
went O
about O
tippling O
at O
his O
tenants’ O
houses O

and O
drank O
rum-and O

water O

Southampton S-GPE

and O
the O
county O
people O
expected O
every O
week O

as O
his O
son O
did O
in O
speechless O
agony O
, O
that O
his O
marriage O

her O
would O
be O
announced O
in O
the O
provincial O
paper O

It O
was O
indeed O
a O
rude O
burthen O
for O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
to O
bear O
. O
His O
eloquence O
was O
palsied O
at O
the O
missionary O
meetings O

other O
religious O
assemblies O
in O
the O

of O
speaking O
for O
hours S-TIME

for O

felt O
, O
when O
he O
rose O
, O
that O
the O
audience O
said O
, O
“ O
That O

the O
son O

old O
reprobate O
Sir O

once O

in O
darkness O

some O
gipsy O

“ O

the O
surprise O

the O

the O
ruin O

Mr. O

And O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
daughters O

Queen’s B-GPE

would O
have O
been O
allowed O

run O
utterly O
wild O

for O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
swore O
that O
no O

not O
Mr. O

by O
threatening O
the O
old O
gentleman O

forced O
the O
latter O
to O
send O
them O

Meanwhile O
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O
whatever O
individual O

be O
between O
them O
all O

Miss O

were O
unanimous O
in O
loving O
her O

sending O
her O
tokens O
of O
affection O
. O
Thus O
Mrs. O

sent O
guinea O

fowls O

some O
remarkably O
fine O
cauliflowers O

a O
pretty O
purse O

pincushion O
worked O
by O
her O

keep O
a O
little O

in O
the O
recollection O
of O
their O
dear O

Mr. O

peaches O

grapes O

venison O
from O
the O

The O
Southampton S-GPE

his O
differences O

like O

saluted O

while O
Pitt B-PERSON

treated O
her O

when O

that O
copy O
of O
poor O

a O
dedication O
from O
the O

it O
in O

it O

, O
before O

presented O
it O
to O
the O
gentle O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
he O
, O
too O
, O
who O
laid O
before O
Lady B-PERSON

the O
great O
advantages O
which O
might O
occur O
from O
an O
intimacy O
between O

Miss O

, O
— O
advantages O
both O
worldly O
and O
spiritual O
, O
he O
said O
: O
for O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
now O
quite O
alone O
| | O
the O
monstrous O
dissipation O
and O
alliance O
of O
his O
brother O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
estranged O
her O
affections O
from O
that O
reprobate O
young O
man O
| | O
the O
greedy O
tyranny O
and O
avarice O
of O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
had O
caused O
the O
old O
lady O
to O
revolt O
against O
the O
exorbitant O
pretensions O
of O
that O
part O
of O
the O

and O
though O
he O
himself O
had O
held O
off O
all O
his O
life O
from O
cultivating O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
friendship O
, O
with O
perhaps O
an O
improper O
pride O
, O
he O
thought O
now O
that O
every O
becoming O
means O
should O
be O
taken O
, O
both O
to O
save O
her O
soul O
from O

to O
secure O
her O
fortune O

himself O

the O
house O
of O
Crawley S-GPE

The O
strong O
- O
minded O
Lady B-PERSON

quite O
agreed O
in O
both O
proposals O
of O
her O

, O
and O
was O
for O
converting O

would O
order O

habit O
of O
approving O
of O
everything O
which O
his O

So O
that O
whatever O

undergo O
( O

it O
accommodated O
itself O
to O

taken O
from O
all O

of O

the O
gratification O

making O
the O
acquaintance O

good O
Mr. O

however O

differ O

him O

it O
was O
impossible O

admire O
fervently O

a O
statesman O

had O
always O
had O
the O
highest O
opinion O
of O
the O
Emperor O
Napoleon S-PERSON

And O
he O
spoke O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
strongest O
indignation O
of O
the O
faithless O
conduct O
of O
the O
allies O

this O
dethroned O

who O

after O
giving O
himself O
generously O
up O

their O
mercy O

ignoble O

cruel O
banishment O

bigoted O

orthodox O
horror O

opinion O

his O
admiration O
for O
Fox S-PERSON

Napoleon S-PERSON
raised O
him O
immeasurably O
in O
Miss O

eyes O
. O
Her O
friendship O
with O
that O
defunct O
British S-NORP
statesman O

mentioned O
when O
we O
first S-ORDINAL
introduced O
her O
in O
this O
history O

A O
true O
Whig S-PERSON
, O
Miss O

had O
been O
in O
opposition O
all O
through O

and O
though O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
downfall O

not O
very O

agitate O
the O
old O

his O
ill O

treatment O

to O
shorten O
her O
life O
or O
natural O
rest O
, O
yet O
Pitt S-PERSON
spoke O
to O
her O
heart O
when O
he O
lauded O
both O
her O
idols O

and O
by O
that O
single O
speech O
made O
immense O
progress O
in O
her O

“ O

do O
you O
think O

my O

Miss O

said O
to O
the O
young O
lady O

for O
whom O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
liking O
at O
first S-ORDINAL

as O
she O
always O
did O
for O
pretty O

modest O
young O

though O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
her O

cooled O
as O
rapidly O
as O
they O
rose O
. O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
blushed O
very O
much O
, O
and O
said O
“ O
that O

not O
understand O
politics O

no O

Mr. O

spoken O
beautifully O

when O
the O
ladies O
were O
retiring O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
their O
visit O
, O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
hoped O
“ O
Lady O

be O
so O
kind O

down O

console O

” O
This O
promise O

graciously O
accorded O

“ O
Don’t S-PERSON
let O
Lady B-PERSON

come O
again O

said O
the O
old O
lady O

“ O
She O
is O
stupid O

pompous O

like O
all O

I O
never O

Pitt S-PERSON
promised O
that O
he O
would O
do O
so O

He O
did O
not O
tell O
the B-PERSON
Countess I-PERSON

opinion O

formed O
of O

on O
the O

nothing O

even O
Firkin S-PERSON

not O
jealous O

the O
gentle O

When O
the O

Mrs. O

regretted O

was O
a O
gawky O
lad O

at O
that O
uncomfortable O
age O

the O

between O
an O
unearthly O

a O
preternatural O
bass O

when O
the O

not O

out O
with O
appearances O

Rowland’s B-PERSON

the O

plenty O

praised O
the O

well O

grown O

very O
much O
improved O

flung O

a O
look O

triumph O

out O

at O

more O

“ O

by O
way O
of O
punishing O

Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
persisted O

being O
gracious O

young O
Oxonian S-PERSON

no O

told O

down O

the O
back O

all O
this O

she O
condescended O

him O

quoted O
Italian S-NORP

French S-NORP

the O
poor O
bewildered O

there O
in O
the O
carriage O

sate O

This O
incident O
damped O
the O
ingenuous O

no O

utter O

the O
thought O

was O
deploring O

found O

“ O

Machiavel S-PERSON
dryly O

perhaps O
rather O
disappointed O
that O
the O
port O

little O
knew O
what O

bringing O
for O
him O

how O
short O
his O
reign O

favour O
was O
destined O
to O
be O

circumstance O

Everything O

while O
the O
atrocious O
master O
of O

stood O
laughing O
at O
the O
horrible O
persecution O

This B-DATE

too O
the O
unlucky O

against O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
: O
he O
drank O
as O
much O
wine O
as O
upon O
the B-DATE

day E-DATE
| | O
and O
going O
quite O
unsuspiciously O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
began O
to O
entertain O
the O
ladies O
there O
with O
some O
choice O
Oxford S-ORG
stories O
. O
He O
described O
the O
different O
pugilistic O
qualities O
of O
Molyneux S-PERSON
and O
Dutch S-NORP
Sam S-PERSON
, O
offered O
playfully O
to O
give O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
the O
odds O
upon O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Tutbury I-WORK_OF_ART
Pet E-WORK_OF_ART
against O
the O
Rottingdean S-NORP
man O
, O
or O
take O
them O
, O
as O
her O
Ladyship S-PERSON
chose O
: O
and O
crowned O
the O
pleasantry O
by O
proposing O
to O
back O
himself O
against O
his O
cousin O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
either O
with O
or O
without O
gloves O
. O
“ O
And O
that’s O
a O
fair O
offer O
, O
my O
buck O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
loud O
laugh O
, O
slapping O
Pitt S-PERSON
on O
the O
shoulder O
, O
“ O
and O
my O
father O
told O
me O
to O
make O
it O
too O
, O
and O
he’ll O
go O
halves O
in O
the O
bet O
, O
ha O
, O
ha O
! O
” O
So O
saying O
, O
the O
engaging O
youth O
nodded O
knowingly O
at O
poor O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
and O
pointed O
his O
thumb O
over O
his O
shoulder O
at O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
in O
a O
jocular O
and O
exulting O
manner O
. O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
not O
pleased O
altogether O
perhaps O
, O
but O
still O
not O
unhappy O
in O
the O
main O
. O
Poor O
Jim S-PERSON
had O
his O
laugh O
out O
: O
and O
staggered O
across O
the O
room O
with O
his O
aunt’s O
candle O
, O
when O
the O
old O
lady O
moved O
to O
retire O
, O
and O
offered O
to O
salute O
her O
with O
the O
blandest O
tipsy O
smile O
: O
and O
he O
took O
his O
own O
leave O
and O
went O
upstairs O
to O
his O
bed- O
room O
perfectly O
satisfied O
with O
himself O
, O
and O
with O
a O
pleased O
notion O
that O
his O
aunt’s O
money O
would O
be O
left O
to O
him O
in O
preference O
to O
his O
father O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
. O
Once O
up O
in O
the O
bed- O
room O
, O
one O
would O
have O
thought O
he O
could O
not O
make O
matters O
worse O
| | O
and O
yet O
this O
unlucky O
boy O
did O
. O
The O
moon O
was O
shining O
very O
pleasantly O
out O
on O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
Jim S-PERSON
, O
attracted O
to O
the O
window O
by O
the O
romantic O
appearance O
of O
the O
ocean O
and O
the O
heavens O
, O
thought O
he O
would O
further O
enjoy O
them O
while O
smoking O
. O
Nobody O
would O
smell O
the O
tobacco O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
if O
he O
cunningly O
opened O
the O
window O
and O
kept O
his O
head O
and O
pipe O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
. O
This O
he O
did O
: O
but O
being O
in O
an O
excited O
state O
, O
poor O
Jim S-PERSON
had O
forgotten O
that O
his O
door O
was O
open O
all O
this O
time O
, O
so O
that O
the O
breeze O
blowing O
inwards O
and O
a O
fine O
thorough O
draught O
being O
established O
, O
the O
clouds O
of O
tobacco O
were O
carried O
downstairs O
, O
and O
arrived O
with O
quite O
undiminished O
fragrance O
to O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
The O
pipe O
of O
tobacco O
finished O
the O
business O
: O
and O
the B-ORG
Bute I-ORG
- I-ORG
Crawleys E-ORG
never O
knew O
how O
many B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
it O
cost O
them O
. O
Firkin S-PERSON
rushed O
downstairs O
to O
Bowls O
who O
was O
reading O
out O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
“ I-WORK_OF_ART

to O
his O

in O
a O
loud O
and O
ghostly O
voice O
. O
The O
dreadful O
secret O
was O
told O
to O
him O
by O
Firkin S-PERSON
with O
so O
frightened O
a O
look O
, O
that O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
Mr. O
Bowls S-PERSON
and O
his O
young O
man O
thought O
that O
robbers O
were O
in O
the O
house O

the O
legs O
of O
whom O
had O
probably O
been O
discovered O
by O
the O
woman O
under O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
bed O
. O
When O
made O
aware O
of O
the O
fact O
, O
however O
— O
to O
rush O
upstairs O
at O
three S-CARDINAL
steps O
at O
a O
time O
— O
to O
enter O
the O
unconscious O
James’s S-FAC
apartment O
, O
calling O
out O
, O
“ O
Mr. O
James S-PERSON
, O
” O
in O
a O
voice O
stifled O
with O
alarm O
, O
and O
to O
cry O
, O
“ O
For O
Gawd’s S-PERSON
sake O
, O
sir O

stop O
that O

” O
was O
the O
work O
of O
a O
moment O
with O
Mr. O

“ O
O O
, O
Mr. O
James S-PERSON
, O
what O
’ O
ave O
you O
done O
! O
” O
he O
said O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
the O
deepest O
pathos O
, O
as O
he O
threw O
the O
implement O
out O
of O
the O
window O
. O
“ O
What O

“ O
Missis O
needn’t O
smoke O

said O
James S-PERSON
with O
a O
frantic O
misplaced O
laugh O
, O
and O
thought O
the O
whole O
matter O
an O
excellent O
joke O
. O
But O
his O
feelings O
were O
very O
different O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Bowls’s S-PERSON
young O
man O
, O
who O
operated O
upon O
Mr. O
James’s S-PERSON
boots O

and O
brought O
him O
his O
hot O
water O
to O
shave O
that O
beard O
which O
he O
was O
so O
anxiously O
expecting O
, O
handed O
a O
note O
in O
to O
Mr. O
James S-PERSON
in O
bed O
, O
in O
the O
handwriting O
of O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON

“ O
Dear O
sir O

it O
said O

“ O
Miss O

passed O

shocking O
manner O
in O
which O
the O

been O
polluted O
by O

disobedience O
. O
He O
dread O
not O
own O
that O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
sentence O
frightened O
him O
, O
and O
that O
its O
fulfilment O
had O
come O
too O
soon O
upon O
his O
curses O
. O
Sometimes O
a O
shuddering O
terror O
struck O
him O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
the O
author O
of O
the O
doom O
which O
he O
had O
called O
down O
on O
his O
son O
. O
There O
was O
a O
chance O
before O
of O
reconciliation O
. O
The O
boy’s O
wife O
might O
have O
died O
| | O
or O
he O
might O
have O
come O
back O
and O
said O
, O
Father O
I O
have O
sinned O
. O
But O
there O
was O
no O
hope O
now O
. O
He O
stood O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
gulf O
impassable O
, O
haunting O
his O
parent O
with O
sad O
eyes O
. O
He O
remembered O
them O
once O
before O
so O
in O
a O
fever O
, O
when O
every O
one O
thought O
the O
lad O
was O
dying O
, O
and O
he O
lay O
on O
his O
bed O
speechless O
, O
and O
gazing O
with O
a O
dreadful O
gloom O
. O
Good O
God O
! O
how O
the O
father O
clung O
to O
the O
doctor O
then O
| | O
and O
with O
what O
a O
sickening O
anxiety O
he O
followed O
him O
: O
what O
a O
weight O
of O
grief O
was O
off O
his O
mind O
when O
, O
after O
the O
crisis O
of O
the O
fever O
, O
the O
lad O
recovered O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
his O
father O
once O
more O
with O
eyes O
that O
recognised O
him O
. O
But O
now O
there O
was O
no O
help O
or O
cure O
, O
or O
chance O
of O
reconcilement O
| | O
above O
all O
, O
there O
were O
no O
humble O
words O
to O
soothe O
vanity O
outraged O
and O
furious O
, O
or O
bring O
to O
its O
natural O
flow O
the O
poisoned O
, O
angry O
blood O
. O
And O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
which O
pang O
it O
was O
that O
tore O
the O
proud O
father’s O
heart O
most O
keenly O
— O
that O
his O
son O
should O
have O
gone O
out O
of O
the O
reach O
of O
his O
forgiveness O
, O
or O
that O
the O
apology O
which O
his O
own O
pride O
expected O
should O
have O
escaped O
him O
. O
Whatever O
his O
sensations O
might O
have O
been O
, O
however O
, O
the O
stern O
old O
man O
would O
have O
no O
confidant O
. O
He O
never O
mentioned O
his O
son’s O
name O
to O
his O
daughters O
| | O
but O
ordered O
the O
elder O
to O
place O
all O
the O
females O
of O
the O
establishment O
in O
mourning O

and O
desired O
that O
the O
male O
servants O
should O
be O
similarly O
attired O
in O
deep O
black O
. O
All O

, O
of O

, O
were O
to O

put O
off O

No O

son-in O

, O
whose O
marriage O

day O
had O
been O
fixed O

there O
was O
enough O
in O
Mr. O

to O
prevent O

He O

about O
it O
under O
their O
voices O
in O
the O
drawing O

with O
a O

Osborne S-PERSON
stared O
at O
him O
for O
a O
moment O

two S-CARDINAL

His O
looks O

guiltily O
for O

at O

in O

just O

The O

which O
the O

Osborne S-PERSON
trembled O
long O
before O
the O
letter O
from O
his O
dead O
son O
. O
The O
poor O
boy’s O
letter O
did O
not O
say O
much O
. O
He O
had O
been O
too O
proud O
to O
acknowledge O
the O
tenderness O
which O
his O
heart O
felt O
. O
He O
only O
said O
, O
that O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
a O
great O
battle O
, O
he O
wished O
to O
bid O
his O
father O
farewell O
, O

solemnly O
to O
implore O
his O
good O
offices O
for O
the O
wife O
— O
it O
might O
be O
for O
the O
child O
— O
whom O
he O
left O
behind O
him O
. O
He O
owned O
with O
contrition O
that O
his O
irregularities O
and O
his O
extravagance O
had O
already O
wasted O
a O
large O
part O

his O
mother’s O

He O
thanked O
his O
father O

he O
promised O
him O

it O

he O

act O
in O
a O
manner O
worthy O

George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON

His O
English S-LANGUAGE
habit O

pride O
awkwardness O
perhaps O

prevented O
him O

saying O

His O
father O
could O
not O
see O
the O
kiss O
George S-PERSON

placed O
on O
the O
superscription O

Mr. O

dropped O
it O
with O
the O
bitterest O

to O
church O

they O
remarked O
how O
he O
took O
a O
different O

he O

occupied O

he O
looked O
up O

their O

there O
the O

It O
seemed O
a O
humiliation O

old O

think O
that O
his O
son O

English S-LANGUAGE
gentleman O

a O
captain O

mere O
foreigners O

Which O
of O
us O

how O

how O
selfish O
our O

Old O
Osborne S-PERSON
did O
not O
speculate O
much O
upon O
the O
mingled O
nature O
of O
his O
feelings O

and O
how O
his O
instinct O
and O
selfishness O
were O
combating O
together O
. O
He O
firmly O
believed O
that O
everything O
he O
did O
was O
right O

that O
he O
ought O
on O
all O
occasions O
to O
have O
his O
own O
way O
— O
and O
like O
the O
sting O
of O
a O
wasp O
or O
serpent O
his O
hatred O
rushed O
out O
armed O
and O
poisonous O
against O
anything O
like O
opposition O
. O
He O
was O
proud O
of O
his O
hatred O
as O
of O
everything O
else O
. O
Always O
to O
be O
right O
, O
always O
to O
trample O
forward O
, O
and O
never O
to O
doubt O
, O
are O
not O
these O
the O
great O
qualities O

dullness O
takes O
the O

Waterloo S-GPE

another O
open O

a O

by O
the O
side O

an O

riding O

Osborne S-PERSON
gave O
a O
start O
back O
, O
and O
the O
Sergeant S-PERSON
, O
seated O
with O
him O
, O
cast O
a O
look O
of O
surprise O
at O
his O
neighbour O
, O
as O
he O
touched O
his O
cap O
to O
the O
officer O
, O
who O
mechanically O
returned O
his O
salute O

It O
was O
Amelia S-PERSON

with O
the O
lame O
young O
Ensign S-PERSON

her O
side O
, O
and O
opposite O
to O
her O
her O
faithful O
friend O
Mrs. O

It O
was O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
but O
how O
changed O
from O
the O
fresh O
and O
comely O
girl O
Osborne S-PERSON
knew O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
white O
and O
thin O
. O
Her O
pretty O
brown O
hair O
was O
parted O
under O
a O
widow’s O
cap O
— O
the O
poor O
child O
. O
Her O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
, O
and O
looking O
nowhere O
. O
They O
stared O
blank O
in O
the O
face O
of O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
as O
the O
carriages O
crossed O
each O
other O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
know O
him O

nor O
did O
he O
recognise O
her O
, O
until O
looking O
up O
, O
he O
saw O
Dobbin S-PERSON
riding O
by O
her O
: O
and O
then O
he O
knew O
who O
it O
was O
. O
He O
hated O
her O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
how O
much O
until O
he O
saw O
her O
there O
. O
When O
her O
carriage O
had O
passed O
on O
, O
he O
turned O
and O
stared O
at O
the O
Sergeant O
, O
with O
a O
curse O
and O
defiance O
in O
his O
eye O
cast O
at O
his O
companion O
, O
who O
could O
not O
help O
looking O
at O
him O
— O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
“ O
How O
dare O
you O
look O
at O
me O
? O
Damn O
you O
! O
I O
do O
hate O
her O

It O
is O
she O
who O
has O
tumbled O
my O

all O
my O

down O
. O
” O
“ O
Tell O
the O
scoundrel O
to O
drive O
on O
quick O

” O
he O
shouted O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
to O
the O
lackey O
on O
the O
box O
. O
A O
minute O
afterwards O
, O
a O
horse O
came O
clattering O
over O
the O
pavement O
behind O
Osborne’s S-PRODUCT
carriage O
, O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
rode O
up O
. O
His O
thoughts O
had O
been O
elsewhere O
as O
the O
carriages O
passed O
each O
other O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
he O
had O
ridden O
some O
paces O
forward O
, O
that O
he O
remembered O
it O
was O
Osborne S-PERSON
who O
had O
just O
passed O
him O
. O
Then O
he O
turned O
to O
examine O
if O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
father O
- O
in O
- O
law O
had O
made O
any O
impression O
on O
Amelia S-PERSON

the O
poor O
girl O
did O
not O
know O
who O
had O
passed O
. O
Then O
William S-PERSON
, O
who O
daily S-DATE
used O
to O
accompany O
her O
in O
his O
drives O
, O
taking O
out O
his O
watch O
, O
made O
some O
excuse O
about O
an O
engagement O
which O
he O
suddenly O
recollected O
, O
and O
so O
rode O
off O
. O
She O
did O
not O
remark O
that O
either O
| | O
but O
sate O
looking O
before O
her O
, O
over O
the O
homely O
landscape O
towards O
the O
woods O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
by O
which O
George S-PERSON
marched O
away O
. O
“ O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
! O
” O
cried O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
rode O
up O
and O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
. O
Osborne S-PERSON
made O
no O
motion O
to O
take O
it O
, O
but O
shouted O
out O
once O
more O
and O
with O
another O
curse O
to O
his O
servant O
to O
drive O
on O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
carriage O
side O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
see O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
have O
a O
message O
for O
you O
. O
” O
“ O
From O
that O
woman O
? O
” O
said O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
fiercely O
. O
“ O
No O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
other O
, O
“ O
from O
your O
son O
| | O
” O
at O
which O
Osborne S-PERSON
fell O
back O
into O
the O
corner O
of O
his O
carriage O
, O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
allowing O
it O
to O
pass O
on O
, O
rode O
close O
behind O
it O
, O
and O
so O
through O
the O
town O
until O
they O
reached O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
hotel O
, O
and O
without O
a O
word O
. O
There O
he O
followed O
Osborne S-PERSON
up O
to O
his O
apartments O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
often O
been O
in O
the O
rooms O
| | O
they O
were O
the O
lodgings O
which O
the O
Crawleys S-ORG
had O
occupied O
during O
their O
stay O
in O
Brussels S-GPE
. O
“ O
Pray O
, O
have O
you O
any O
commands O
for O
me O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
or O
, O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
I O
should O
say O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
since O
better O
men O
than O
you O
are O
dead O
, O
and O
you O
step O
into O
their O
shoes O
? O
” O
said O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
in O
that O
sarcastic O
tone O
which O
he O
sometimes O
was O
pleased O
to O
assume O
. O
“ O
Better O
men O
are O
dead O
, O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
replied O
. O
“ O
I O
want O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
about O
one O
. O
” O
“ O
Make O
it O
short O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
said O
the O
other O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
scowling O
at O
his O
visitor O
. O
“ O
I O
am O
here O
as O
his O
closest O
friend O
, O
” O
the O
Major O
resumed O
, O
“ O
and O
the O
executor O
of O
his O
will O
. O
He O
made O
it O
before O
he O
went O
into O
action O
. O
Are O
you O
aware O
how O
small O
his O
means O
are O
, O
and O
of O
the O
straitened O
circumstances O
of O
his O
widow O

” O
“ O
I O
don’t O
know O
his O
widow O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
Let O
her O
go O
back O
to O
her O
father O
. O
” O
But O
the O
gentleman O
whom O
he O
addressed O
was O
determined O
to O
remain O
in O
good O
temper O
, O
and O
went O
on O
without O
heeding O
the O
interruption O
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
Mrs. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
condition O
? O
Her O
life O
and O
her O
reason O
almost O
have O
been O
shaken O
by O
the O
blow O
which O
has O
fallen O
on O
her O
. O
It O
is O
very O
doubtful O
whether O
she O
will O
rally O
. O
There O
is O
a O
chance O
left O
for O
her O
, O
however O
, O
and O
it O
is O
about O
this O
I O
came O
to O
speak O
to O
you O

She O
will O
be O
a O
mother O
soon O

Will O
you O
visit O
the O
parent’s O
offence O
upon O
the O
child’s O
head O
? O
or O
will O
you O
forgive O
the O
child O
for O
poor O
George’s S-PERSON
sake O
? O
” O
Osborne S-PERSON
broke O
out O
into O
a O
rhapsody O
of O
self O
- O
praise O
and O
imprecations O
| | O
— O
by O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
excusing O
himself O
to O
his O
own O
conscience O
for O
his O
conduct O
| | O
by O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
, O
exaggerating O
the O
undutifulness O
of O
George S-PERSON
. O
No O
father O
in O
all O
England S-GPE
could O
have O
behaved O
more O
generously O
to O
a O
son O
, O
who O
had O
rebelled O
against O
him O
wickedly O
. O
He O
had O
died O
without O
even O
so O
much O
as O
confessing O
he O
was O
wrong O
. O
Let O
him O
take O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
undutifulness O
and O
folly O
. O
As O
for O
himself O
, O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
his O
word O
. O
He O
had O
sworn O
never O
to O
speak O
to O
that O
woman O
, O
or O
to O
recognize O
her O
as O
his O
son’s O
wife O
. O
“ O
And O
that’s O
what O
you O
may O
tell O
her O
, O
” O
he O
concluded O
with O
an O
oath O

“ O
and O
that’s O
what O
I O
will O
stick O
to O

the O
last O
day O

my O
life O

” O
There O
was O
no O
hope O
from O
that B-DATE
quarter E-DATE

. O
The O
widow O
must O
live O
on O
her O
slender O
pittance O
, O

on O
such O
aid O

Jos S-PERSON
could O
give O
her O
. O
“ O
I O
might O
tell O
her O
, O
and O
she O
would O
not O
heed O
it O
, O
” O
thought O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
sadly O
: O
for O
the O
poor O
girl’s O
thoughts O
were O
not O
here O
at O
all O
since O
her O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
, O
stupefied O
under O
the O
pressure O
of O
her O
sorrow O
, O
good O
and O
evil O
were O
alike O
indifferent O
to O
her O
. O
So O
, O
indeed O
, O
were O
even O
friendship O
and O
kindness O
. O
She O
received O
them O
both O
uncomplainingly O
, O
and O
having O
accepted O
them O
, O
relapsed O
into O
her O
grief O
. O
Suppose O
some B-DATE
twelve I-DATE
months E-DATE
after O
the O
above O
conversation O
took O
place O
to O
have O
passed O
in O
the O
life O
of O
our O
poor O
Amelia S-PERSON
She O
has O
spent O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
portion O
of O
that O
time O
in O
a O
sorrow O
so O
profound O
and O
pitiable O
, O
that O
we O
who O
have O
been O
watching O
and O
describing O
some O
of O
the O
emotions O
of O
that O
weak O
and O
tender O
heart O
, O
must O
draw O
back O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
cruel O
grief O
under O
which O
it O
is O
bleeding O
. O
Tread O
silently O
round O
the O
hapless O
couch O
of O
the O
poor O
prostrate O
soul O
. O
Shut O
gently O
the O
door O
of O
the O
dark O
chamber O
wherein O
she O
suffers O
, O
as O
those O
kind O
people O
did O
who O
nursed O
her O
through O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
months E-DATE
of O
her O
pain O
, O
and O
never O
left O
her O
until O
heaven O
had O
sent O
her O
consolation O
. O
A O
day O
came O
— O
of O
almost O
terrified O
delight O
and O
wonder O
— O
when O
the O
poor O
widowed O
girl O
pressed O
a O
child O
upon O
her O
breast O
— O
a O
child O
, O
with O
the O
eyes O
of O
George S-PERSON
who O
was O
gone O
— O
a O
little O
boy O
, O
as O
beautiful O
as O
a O
cherub O
. O
What O
a O
miracle O
it O
was O
to O
hear O
its O
first S-ORDINAL
cry O
! O
How O
she O
laughed O
and O
wept O
over O
it O
— O
how O
love O
, O
and O
hope O
, O
and O
prayer O
woke O
again O
in O
her O
bosom O
as O
the O
baby O
nestled O
there O
. O
She O
was O
safe O
. O
The O
doctors O
who O
attended O
her O
, O
and O
had O
feared O
for O
her O
life O
or O
for O
her O
brain O
, O
had O
waited O
anxiously O
for O
this O
crisis O
before O
they O
could O
pronounce O
that O
either O
was O
secure O
. O
It O
was O
worth O
the B-DATE
long I-DATE
months E-DATE
of O
doubt O
and O
dread O
which O
the O
persons O
who O
had O
constantly O
been O
with O
her O
had O
passed O
, O
to O
see O
her O
eyes O
once O
more O
beaming O
tenderly O
upon O
them O
. O
Our O
friend O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O
It O
was O
he O
who O
brought O
her O
back O
to O
England S-GPE
and O
to O
her O
mother’s O
house O

when O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
, O
receiving O
a O
peremptory O
summons O
from O
her O
Colonel O
, O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
quit O
her O
patient O
. O
To O
see O
Dobbin S-PERSON
holding O
the O
infant O
, O
and O
to O
hear O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
laugh O
of O
triumph O
as O
she O
watched O
him O
, O
would O
have O
done O
any O
man O
good O
who O
had O
a O
sense O
of O
humour O
. O
William S-PERSON
was O
the O
godfather O
of O
the O
child O
, O
and O
exerted O
his O
ingenuity O
in O
the O
purchase O
of O
cups O

spoons O
, O
pap O
- O
boats O
, O
and O
corals O
for O
this O
little O
Christian S-NORP

How O
his O
mother O
nursed O
him O

dressed O
him O
, O
and O
lived O
upon O
him O

how O
she O
drove O
away O
all O
nurses O

would O
scarce O
allow O
any O
hand O
but O
her O
own O
to O
touch O
him O

how O
she O
considered O

the O
greatest O
favour O
she O
could O
confer O
upon O
his O
godfather O
, O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
was O
to O
allow O
the O
Major O
occasionally O
to O
dandle O
him O
, O
need O
not O
be O
told O
here O
. O
This O
child O
was O
her O
being O
. O
Her O
existence O
was O
a O
maternal O
caress O
. O
She O
enveloped O
the O
feeble O
and O
unconscious O
creature O
with O
love O
and O
worship O
. O
It O
was O
her O
life O
which O
the O
baby O
drank O
in O
from O
her O
bosom O
. O
Of O
nights O
, O
and O
when O
alone O
, O
she O
had O
stealthy O
and O
intense O
raptures O
of O
motherly O
love O
, O
such O
as O
God’s O
marvellous O
care O
has O
awarded O
to O
the O
female O
instinct O
— O
joys O
how O
far O
higher O
and O
lower O
than O
reason O
— O
blind O
beautiful O
devotions O
which O
only O
women’s O
hearts O
know O

It O
was O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin’s E-PERSON
task O
to O
muse O
upon O
these O
movements O
of O
Amelia’s S-NORP
, O
and O
to O
watch O
her O
heart O

and O
if O
his O
love O
made O
him O
divine O
almost O
all O
the O
feelings O
which O
agitated O
it O
, O
alas O
! O
he O
could O
see O
with O
a O
fatal O
perspicuity O
that O
there O
was O
no O
place O
there O
for O
him O

And O
so O
, O
gently O
, O
he O
bore O
his O
fate O
, O
knowing O
it O
, O
and O
content O
to O
bear O
it O
. O
I O
suppose O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
father O

mother O
saw O
through O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
Major O

were O
not O
ill O

disposed O

encourage O
him O

for O
Dobbin S-PERSON
visited O
their O

daily S-DATE

stayed O
for O
hours O
with O

with O
the O
honest O
landlord O

Mr. O
Clapp S-PERSON

his O

brought O

on O
one S-CARDINAL

another O

presents O
to O
everybody O
, O

almost O
every O
day O

went O
, O
with O
the O
landlord’s O
little O
girl O
, O
who O
was O
rather O
a O
favourite O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Major O
Sugarplums S-PERSON

It O
was O
this O
little O
child O
who O
commonly O
acted O
as O
mistress O
of O
the O
ceremonies O
to O
introduce O
him O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON

laughed O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
when O
Major O

cab O
drove O
up O
to O
Fulham S-GPE

he O
descended O

out O

a O
drum O

the O

The O
child O

asleep O

“ O
Hush S-PERSON

” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON

annoyed O

perhaps O

at O
the O
creaking O

and O
she O
held O
out O
her O
hand O

smiling O
because O
William S-PERSON
could O
not O
take O
it O
until O
he O
had O
rid O
himself O
of O
his O

of O

“ O
Go O
downstairs O
, O
little O
Mary S-PERSON

” O
said O
he O
presently O
to O
the O
child O
, O
“ O
I O
want O
to O
speak O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON

” O
She O
looked O
up O
rather O
astonished O
, O
and O
laid O
down O
the O
infant O
on O
its O
bed O
. O
“ O
I O
am O
come O

Amelia S-PERSON

said O
he O
, O
taking O
her O
slender O
little O
white O
hand O
gently O
. O
“ O
Good O
- O
bye O
? O
and O
where O
are O
you O
going O
? O
” O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
. O
“ O
Send O
the O
letters O
to O
the O

he O
said O

“ O

” O
“ O
I’ll O
write O
to O
you O
about O
Georgy S-PERSON

” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
Dear O

how O
good O
you O
have O
been O
to O
him O

Look O
at O
him O

Isn’t O
he O
like O

” O
The O
little O
pink O
hands O
of O
the O
child O
closed O
mechanically O
round O
the O
honest O
soldier’s O
finger O
, O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
looked O
up O
in O
his O
face O
with O
bright O
maternal O
pleasure O
. O
The O
cruellest O
looks O
could O
not O
have O
wounded O
him O
more O
than O
that O
glance O
of O
hopeless O
kindness O
. O
He O
bent O
over O
the O
child O
and O
mother O
. O
He O
could O
not O
speak O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
And O
it O
was O
only O
with O
all O
his O
strength O
that O
he O
could O
force O
himself O
to O
say O
a O
God O

you O
. O
“ O
God O

” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
and O
held O
up O
her O
face O

kissed O
him O
. O
“ O
Hush O

Don’t S-PERSON
wake O
Georgy S-PERSON

” O
she O
added O
, O
as O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
went O
to O
the O

heavy O

of O
which O
we O
can O
afford O

but O
a O
very O
brief O
history O
, O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
lived O
very O
happily O
and O
comfortably O
at O
Paris S-GPE
. O
It O
was O
in O
this O
period O
that O
he O
quitted O
the O
Guards S-ORG
, O
and O
sold O
out O
of O
the O
army O
. O
When O
we O
find O
him O
again O
, O
his O
mustachios O
and O
the O
title O
of O
Colonel O
on O
his O
card O
are O
the O
only O
relics O
of O
his O
military O
profession O
. O
It O
has O
been O
mentioned O
that O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
soon O
after O
her O
arrival O
in O
Paris S-GPE
, O
took O
a O
very O
smart O
and O
leading O
position O
in O
the O
society O
of O
that O
capital O
, O
and O
was O
welcomed O
at O
some O
of O
the O
most O
distinguished O
houses O
of O
the O
restored O
French S-NORP
nobility O
. O
The O
English S-LANGUAGE
men O
of O
fashion O
in O
Paris S-GPE
courted O
her O
, O
too O
, O
to O
the O
disgust O
of O
the O
ladies O
their O
wives O
, O
who O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
parvenue O
. O
For O
some B-DATE
months E-DATE
the O
salons O
of O
the B-FAC
Faubourg I-FAC
St. I-FAC
Germain E-FAC
, O
in O
which O
her O
place O
was O
secured O
, O
and O
the O
splendours O
of O
the O
new O
Court S-ORG
, O
where O
she O
was O
received O
with O
much O
distinction O
, O
delighted O
, O
and O
perhaps O
a O
little O
intoxicated O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
who O
may O
have O
been O
disposed O
during O
this O
period O
of O
elation O
to O
slight O
the O
people O
— O
honest O
young O
military O
men O
mostly O
— O
who O
formed O
her O
husband’s O
chief O
society O
. O
But O
the O
Colonel O
yawned O
sadly O
among O
the O
duchesses O
and O
great O
ladies O
of O
the O
Court S-ORG
. O
The O
old O
women O
who O
played O
écarté O
made O
such O
a O
noise O
about O
a O
five B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
franc E-MONEY
piece O
, O
that O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
Colonel O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
while O
to O
sit O
down O
at O
a O
card O
- O
table O
. O
The O
wit O
of O
their O
conversation O
he O
could O
not O
appreciate O
, O
being O
ignorant O
of O
their O
language O
. O
And O
what O
good O
could O
his O
wife O
get O
, O
he O
urged O
, O
by O
making O
curtsies O
every O
night O
to O
a O
whole O
circle O
of O
Princesses O
? O
He O
left O
Rebecca S-PERSON
presently O
to O
frequent O
these O
parties O
alone O

resuming O
his O
own O
simple O
pursuits O
and O
amusements O
amongst O
the O
amiable O
friends O
of O
his O
own O
choice O
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
when O
we O
say O
of O
a O
gentleman O
that O
he O
lives O
elegantly O
on O
nothing O
a O
- O
year O
, O
we O
use O
the O
word O
“ O
nothing O
” O
to O
signify O
something O
unknown O
| | O
meaning O
, O
simply O
, O
that O
we O
don’t O
know O
how O
the O
gentleman O
in O
question O
defrays O
the O
expenses O
of O
his O
establishment O
. O
Now O
, O
our O
friend O
the O
Colonel O
had O
a O
great O
aptitude O
for O
all O
games O
of O
chance O
: O
and O
exercising O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
continually O
did O
, O
with O
the O
cards O
, O
the O
dice O
- O
box O
, O
or O
the O
cue O
, O
it O
is O
natural O
to O
suppose O
that O
he O
attained O
a O
much O
greater O
skill O
in O
the O
use O
of O
these O
articles O
than O
men O
can O
possess O
who O
only O
occasionally O
handle O
them O
. O
To O
use O
a O
cue O
at O
billiards O
well O
is O
like O
using O
a O
pencil O
, O

Now O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
from O
being O
only O
a O
brilliant O
amateur O
, O
had O
grown O
to O
be O
a O
consummate O
master O
of O
billiards O
. O
Like O
a O
great O
general O
, O
his O
genius O
used O
to O
rise O
with O
the O
danger O
, O
and O
when O
the O
luck O
had O
been O
unfavourable O
to O
him O
for O
a O
whole O
game O
, O
and O
the O
bets O
were O
consequently O
against O
him O
, O
he O
would O
, O
with O
consummate O
skill O
and O
boldness O
, O
make O
some O
prodigious O
hits O
which O
would O
restore O
the O
battle O

and O
come O
in O
a O
victor O
at O
the O
end O

to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
everybody O
— O
of O
everybody O
, O
that O
is O
, O
who O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
his O
play O

Those O
who O
were O
accustomed O
to O
see O
it O
were O
cautious O
how O
they O
staked O
their O
money O
against O
a O
man O
of O
such O
sudden O
resources O
, O
and O
brilliant O
and O
over O
- O
powering O
skill O

At O
games O
of O
cards O
he O
was O
equally O
skilful O

for O
though O
he O
would O
constantly O
lose O
money O
at O
the O
commencement O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
playing O
so O
carelessly O
and O
making O
such O
blunders O
, O
that O
new O
comers O
were O
often O
inclined O
to O
think O
meanly O
of O
his O
talent O
| | O
yet O
when O
roused O
to O
action O
, O
and O
awakened O
to O
caution O
by O
repeated O
small O
losses O
, O
it O
was O
remarked O
that O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
play O
became O
quite O
different O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
pretty O
sure O
of O
beating O
his O
enemy O
thoroughly O
before O
the O
night O
was O
over O
. O
Indeed O
, O
very O
few O
men O
could O
say O
that O
they O
ever O
had O
the O
better O
of O
him O
. O
His O
successes O
were O
so O
repeated O
that O
no O
wonder O
the O
envious O
and O
the O
vanquished O
spoke O
sometimes O
with O
bitterness O
regarding O
them O

And O
as O
the O
French S-NORP
say O
of O
the B-PERSON
Duke I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Wellington E-PERSON
, O
who O
never O
suffered O
a O
defeat O
, O
that O
only O
an O
astonishing O
series O
of O
lucky O
accidents O
enabled O
him O
to O
be O
an O
invariable O
winner O

yet O
even O
they O
allow O
that O
he O
cheated O
at O
Waterloo S-ORG
, O
and O
was O
enabled O
to O
win O
the O
last O
great O
trick O
: O
— O
so O
it O
was O
hinted O
at O
head O
- O
quarters O
in O
England S-GPE
, O
that O
some O
foul O
play O
must O
have O
taken O
place O
in O
order O
to O
account O
for O
the O
continuous O
successes O
of O
Colonel O

Though O
Frascati’s S-PERSON
and O
the O
Salon S-FAC
were O
open O
at O
that O
time O
in O
Paris S-GPE

the O
mania O
for O
play O
was O
so O
widely O
spread O
, O
that O
the O
public O
gambling O
- O
rooms O
did O
not O
suffice O
for O
the O
general O
ardour O
, O
and O
gambling O
went O
on O
in O
private O
houses O
as O
much O
as O
if O
there O
had O
been O
no O
public O

for O
gratifying O
the O
passion O

At O
Crawley’s O
charming O
little O

of O
an O
evening O
this O
fatal O
amusement O
commonly O
was O
practised O

Mrs. O

She O
spoke O
about O
her O
husband’s O
passion O
for O
dice O
with O
the O
deepest O
grief O

she O
bewailed O
it O
to O
everybody O
who O
came O
to O
her O
house O

She O
besought O
the O

and O
when O

a O
very O
considerable O

Rebecca S-PERSON
passed O
a O
whole O
night O
in O

as O
the O
servant O
told O
the O
unfortunate O
young O

How O

in O

of O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
undoubted O
skill O

constant O
successes O
, O
it O
became O
evident O
to O
Rebecca S-PERSON

considering O
these O
things O
, O
that O
their O
position O
was O

a O

that O

then O
where O

Rawdon S-PERSON
acquiesced O
in O
the O
justice O
of O
her O
opinion O

in O
truth O
he O
had O

nights O

did O
not O
present O
themselves O
very O
eagerly O

Easy O

pleasant O
as O
their O
life O
at O
Paris S-GPE
was O

it O
was O
after O
all O
only O
an O
idle O
dalliance O

amiable O
trifling O

and O
Rebecca S-PERSON
saw O
that O
she O
must O
push O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
fortune O
in O
their O
own O
country O

She O

him O

she O
determined O
to O
make O
a O
move O
upon O
England S-GPE
as O
soon O
as O
the O
way O
could O
be O
cleared O

As O
a O
first S-ORDINAL

General O
Tufto S-PERSON

ceased O

Rebecca S-PERSON
laughed O
in O
all O
companies O
at O
that O
officer O

at O
his O
toupee O
( O
which O
he O
mounted O
on O
coming O

Paris S-GPE
) O
, O
at O
his O

at O
his O
false O

at O
his O
pretensions O
to O
be O
a O
lady O

killer O
above O
all O

and O
his O
absurd O
vanity O
in O
fancying O
every O

he O
came O
near O

in O

Poor O
Mrs. O
Tufto S-PERSON
was O
no O
more O
happy O
than O
before O

had O
still O
to O
pass O
long O
evenings O
alone O
with O
her O
daughters O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
General O
was O
gone O
off O

curled O
to O
stand O
behind O
Mrs. O
Brent’s S-PERSON
chair O
at O
the O

Becky S-PERSON
had O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
admirers O

could O
cut O
her O

pieces O
with O
her O
wit O

But O
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O
she O
was O
growing O
tired O
of O
this O
idle O
social O
life O
: O
opera-boxes O
and O
restaurateur O
- O
dinners O
palled O
upon O
her O

gays O
could O
not O
be O
laid O
by O
a O

she O
could O
not O
live O
upon O

knacks O
, O
laced O
handkerchiefs O
, O

kid O

She O
felt O
the O
frivolity O
of O
pleasure O
, O
and O
longed O
for O
more O
substantial O
benefits O

At O
this O
juncture O
news O
arrived O
which O
was O
spread O
among O
the O
many O
creditors O
of O
the O
Colonel O
at O
Paris S-GPE

and O
which O
caused O
them O
great O
satisfaction O

Miss O

the O
rich O
aunt O
from O
whom O
he O
expected O
his O
immense O
inheritance O

was O
dying O

the O
Colonel O
must O
haste O
to O
her O
bedside O

Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
her O
child O
would O
remain O
behind O
until O
he O
came O
to O
reclaim O
them O
. O
He O
departed O
for O
Calais S-GPE
, O
and O
having O
reached O
that O
place O
in O
safety O
, O
it O
might O
have O
been O
supposed O
that O
he O
went O
to O
Dover S-ORG

but O
instead O
he O
took O
the O
diligence O
to O
Dunkirk S-GPE

thence O
travelled O
to O
Brussels S-GPE

for O
which O
place O
he O
had O
a O
former O
predilection O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
he O
owed O
more O
money O
at O
London S-GPE
than O
at O
Paris S-GPE

and O
he O
preferred O
the O
quiet O
little O
Belgian S-NORP
city O
to O
either O
of O
the O
more O
noisy O
capitals O

Her O
aunt O
was O
dead O

Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
ordered O
the O
most O
intense O
mourning O
for O
herself O

The O
Colonel O
was O
busy O

could O
take O

the O

they O
occupied O
. O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
and O
the O
landlord O
had O
a O
consultation O
about O
the O
new O
hangings O

an O
amicable O
wrangle O
about O
the O

a O
final O

would O
ride O

when O

he O
quitted O

almost O
parent O

he O
cried O
loudly O

He O
was O
only O
consoled O
by O

told O

Raggles S-PERSON
loved O

family O
as O
the O
author O
of O
all O
his O

a O

the O

Sir O

Baronet S-PERSON

Indeed O
Raggles S-PERSON
thought O
there O
was O
no O
such O
palace O
in O
all O
the O
world O

no O
such O
august O

As O
luck O
would O
have O
it O
, O
Raggles’ B-FAC
house E-FAC
in O
Curzon B-FAC
Street E-FAC
was O
to O
let O
when O
Rawdon S-PERSON

his O
wife O
returned O
to O
London S-GPE
. O
The O
Colonel O
knew O
it O

its O
owner O
quite O
well O

the O
latter’s O
connexion O
with O
the O
Crawley S-PERSON
family O
had O
been O
kept O
up O
constantly O
, O
for O
Raggles S-PERSON
helped O
Mr. O
Bowls S-PERSON
whenever O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
received O
friends O
. O
And O
the O
old O
man O
not O
only O
let O
his O
house O
to O
the O
Colonel O
, O
but O
officiated O
as O
his O
butler O
whenever O
he O
had O
company O

Mrs. O
Raggles S-PERSON
operating O
in O
the O
kitchen O
below O
, O
and O
sending O
up O
dinners O
of O
which O
old O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
herself O
might O
have O
approved O
. O
This O
was O
the O
way O
, O
then O
, O
Crawley S-PERSON
got O
his O
house O
for O
nothing O
| | O
for O
though O
Raggles S-PERSON
had O
to O
pay O
taxes O
and O
rates O
, O
and O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
mortgage O
to O
the O
brother O
butler O

and O
the O
insurance O
of O
his O
life O

and O
the O
charges O
for O
his O
children O
at O
school O

and O
the O
value O
of O
the O
meat O
and O
drink O
which O
his O
own O
family O
— O
and O
for O
a O
time O
that O
of O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
too O
— O
consumed O
| | O
and O
though O
the O
poor O
wretch O
was O
utterly O
ruined O
by O
the O
transaction O
, O
his O
children O
being O
flung O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
himself O
driven O
into O
the B-FAC
Fleet I-FAC
Prison E-FAC

yet O
somebody O
must O
pay O
even O
for O
gentlemen O
who O
live O
for O
nothing O
a O
- O
year O
— O
and O
so O
it O
was O
this O
unlucky O
Raggles S-PERSON
was O
made O
the O
representative O
of O
Colonel O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
defective O
capital O
. O
I O
wonder O
how O
many O
families O
are O
driven O
to O
roguery O
and O
to O
ruin O
by O
great O
practitioners O
in O
Crawley’s S-GPE
way O
? O
— O
how O
many O
great O
noblemen O
rob O
their O
petty O
tradesmen O
, O
condescend O
to O
swindle O
their O
poor O
retainers O
out O
of O
wretched O
little O
sums O
, O
and O
cheat O
for O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
shillings E-MONEY
? O
When O
we O
read O
that O
a O
noble O
nobleman O
has O
left O
for O
the O
Continent S-LOC
, O
or O
that O
another O
noble O
nobleman O
has O
an O
execution O
in O
his O
house O
— O
and O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
other O
owes O
six B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
seven I-CARDINAL
millions E-CARDINAL
, O
the O
defeat O
seems O
glorious O
even O
, O
and O
we O
respect O
the O
victim O
in O
the O
vastness O
of O
his O
ruin O
. O
But O
who O
pities O
a O
poor O
barber O
who O
can’t O
get O
his O
money O
for O
powdering O
the O
footman’s O
heads O

or O
a O
poor O
carpenter O
who O
has O
ruined O
himself O
by O
fixing O
up O
ornaments O
and O
pavilions O
for O
my O
lady’s O

or O
the O
poor O
devil O
of O
a O

whom O
the O

patronises O

who O
has O
pledged O
all O

more O

to O
get O
the O
liveries O
ready O
, O
which O
my O
lord O
has O
done O
him O
the O
honour O
to O
bespeak O
? O
— O
When O
the O
great O
house O
tumbles O
down O
, O
these O
miserable O
wretches O
fall O
under O
it O
unnoticed O
: O
as O
they O
say O
in O
the O
old O

, O
before O
a O

goes O
to O
the O

he O
sends O
plenty O
of O

Rawdon S-PERSON

Some O
were O

It O
was O
wonderful O

, O
probably O
, O
200 S-CARDINAL

When O
you O

was O
a O

cut O

was O
curious O

not O
altogether O

To O
stare O
Becky S-PERSON
out O

required O
a O
severer O

her O
at O

through O

Rawdon S-PERSON

felt O
very O
acutely O
the O

it O
was O
only O
by O
the O
strongest O
commands O

entreaties O
on O
her O
part O
, O
that O
he O
was O
brought O

“ O

Mr. O

kindness O
to O
her O
in O
early O
days O
when O
she O
was O
a O
friendless O
orphan O

the O
instructress O

( O
of O
whose O
goodness O
all O
the O
world O
informed O
her O
) O
, O
she O
hoped O
that O
one O
day O
she O
might O
be O
allowed O
to O
present O
her O
little O
boy O
to O
his O
uncle O

and O
begged O

bespeak O
for O
him O
their O
good O

will O
and O
protection O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
received O
this O
communication O
very O
graciously O
— O
more O
graciously O
than O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
received O
some O
of O
Rebecca’s O
previous O
compositions O
in O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
handwriting O
| | O
and O
as O
for O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
so O
charmed O
with O
the O
letter O
, O
that O
she O
expected O
her O
husband O
would O
instantly O
divide O
his O
aunt’s O
legacy O
into O
two S-CARDINAL
equal O
portions O
, O
and O
send O
off O
one B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
to O
his O
brother O
at O
Paris S-GPE
. O
To O
her O
ladyship’s O
surprise O
, O
however O
, O
Pitt S-PERSON
declined O
to O
accommodate O
his O
brother O
with O
a O
cheque O
for O
thirty B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
. O
But O
he O
made O
Rawdon S-PERSON
a O
handsome O
offer O
of O
his O
hand O
whenever O
the O
latter O
should O
come O
to O
England S-GPE
and O
choose O
to O
take O
it O

and O
, O
thanking O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
for O
her O
good O
opinion O
of O
himself O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
, O
he O
graciously O
pronounced O
his O
willingness O
to O
take O
any O
opportunity O
to O
serve O
her O
little O
boy O
. O
Thus O
an O
almost O
reconciliation O
was O
brought O
about O
between O
the O
brothers O
. O
When O
Rebecca S-PERSON
came O
to O
town O
Pitt S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
not O
in O
London S-GPE
. O
Many O
a O
time O
she O
drove O
by O
the O
old O
door O
in O
Park B-FAC
Lane E-FAC
to O
see O
whether O
they O
had O
taken O
possession O
of O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
house O
there O
. O
But O
the O
new O
family O
did O
not O
make O
its O
appearance O
| | O
it O
was O
only O
through O
Raggles S-PERSON
that O
she O
heard O
of O
their O
movements O
— O
how O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
domestic O
had O
been O
dismissed O
with O
decent O
gratuities O
, O
and O
how O
Mr. O
Pitt S-PERSON
had O
only O
once O
made O
his O
appearance O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
when O
he O
stopped O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
at O
the O
house O
, O
did O
business O
with O
his O
lawyers O
there O
, O
and O
sold O
off O
all O
Miss O
Crawley’s O
French S-NORP
novels O
to O
a O
bookseller O
out O
of O
Bond B-FAC
Street E-FAC
. O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
reasons O
of O
her O
own O
which O
caused O
her O
to O
long O
for O
the O
arrival O
of O
her O
new O
relation O
. O
“ O

won O
his O
marquisate O
, O
it O
was O
said O
, O
at O
the O
gaming O
- O
table O

but O
he O
did O
not O
like O
an O
allusion O
to O
those O
bygone O
fredaines O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
saw O
the O
scowl O
gathering O
over O
his O
heavy O
brow O
. O
She O
rose O
up O
from O
her O
sofa O
, O
and O
went O
and O
took O
his O
coffee O
cup O
out O
of O
his O
hand O
with O
a O
little O
curtsey O
. O
“ O
Yes O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
must O
get O
a O
watchdog O
. O
But O
he O
won’t O
bark O
at O
you O

” O
And O
, O
going O
into O
the O
other O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
she O
sate O
down O
to O
the O
piano O
, O
and O
began O
to O
sing O
little O
French S-NORP
songs O
in O
such O
a O
charming O
, O
thrilling O
voice O
, O
that O
the O
mollified O
nobleman O
speedily O
followed O
her O
into O
that O
chamber O
, O
and O
might O
be O
seen O
nodding O
his O
head O
and O
bowing O
time O
over O
her O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
friend O
meanwhile O
played O
écarté O
until O
they O
had O
enough O
. O
The O
Colonel O
won O

but O
, O
say O
that O
he O
won O
ever O
so O
much O
and O
often O
, O
nights O
like O
these O
, O
which O
occurred O
many O
times O
in O
the O
week O
— O
his O
wife O
having O
all O
the O
talk O
and O
all O
the O
admiration O
, O
and O
he O
sitting O
silent O
without O
the O
circle O
, O
not O
comprehending O
a O
word O
of O
the O
jokes O
, O
the O
allusions O
, O
the O
mystical O
language O
within O
— O
must O
have O
been O
rather O
wearisome O
to O
the O
ex-dragoon O
. O
“ O
How O
is O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
husband O
? O
” O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
used O
to O
say O
to O
him O
by O
way O
of O
a O
good O
day O
when O
they O
met O
: O
and O
indeed O
that O
was O
now O
his O
avocation O
in O
life O
. O
He O
was O
Colonel B-PERSON

He O
was O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON

. O
About O
the O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
if O
nothing O
has O
been O
said O
all O
this O
while O
, O
it O
is O
because O
he O
is O
hidden O
upstairs O
in O
a O
garret O
somewhere O
, O
or O
has O
crawled O
below O
into O
the O
kitchen O
for O
companionship O
. O
His O
mother O
scarcely O
ever O
took O
notice O
of O
him O
. O
He O
passed O
the O
days O
with O
his O
French S-NORP
bonne O
as O
long O
as O
that O
domestic O
remained O
in O
Mr. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
family O
, O
and O
when O
the O
Frenchwoman S-NORP
went O
away O
, O
the O
little O
fellow O
, O
howling O
in O
the O
loneliness O
of O
the O
night O
, O
had O
compassion O
taken O
on O
him O
by O
a O
housemaid O
, O
who O
took O
him O
out O
of O
his O
solitary O
nursery O
into O
her O
bed O
in O
the O
garret O
hard O
by O

comforted O
him O

Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
my O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL

were O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
taking O
tea O
after O
the O
Opera O
, O
when O
this O
shouting O
was O
heard O
overhead O
. O
“ O
It’s O
my O
cherub O
crying O
for O
his O
nurse O

” O
she O
said O
. O
She O
did O
not O
offer O
to O
move O
to O
go O
and O
see O
the O
child O

“ O
Don’t O
agitate O
your O
feelings O
by O
going O
to O
look O
for O
him O
, O
” O
said O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
sardonically O
. O
“ O
Bah O
! O
” O
replied O
the O
other O
, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
blush O
, O
“ O
he’ll O
cry O
himself O
to O
sleep O

” O
and O
they O
fell O
to O
talking O
about O
the O
Opera O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
stolen O
off O
though O
, O
to O
look O
after O
his O
son O

and O
came O
back O

the O
company O

he O
found O
that O
honest O
Dolly S-PERSON
was O
consoling O
the O
child O
. O
The O
Colonel’s S-NORP
dressing O

in O
those O

He O
used O
to O
see O
the O
boy O
there O
in O
private O

They O
had O
interviews O
together O
every O
morning O
when O
he O
shaved O

Rawdon S-PERSON

sitting O
on O
a O

by O
his O

the O
operation O
with O
never O

ceasing O
pleasure O
. O
He O
and O
the O
sire O
were O
great O
friends O

The O
father O
would O
bring O
him O
sweetmeats O
from O
the O
dessert O
, O
and O
hide O
them O
in O
a O
certain O
old O
epaulet O
box O
, O
where O
the O
child O
went O
to O
seek O
them O
, O
and O
laughed O
with O
joy O
on O
discovering O
the O
treasure O

laughed O
, O
but O
not O
too O
loud O
: O
for O
mamma O
was O
below O
asleep O
and O
must O
not O
be O
disturbed O
. O
She O
did O
not O
go O
to O
rest O
till O
very O
late O
, O
and O
seldom O
rose O
till O
after O
noon S-TIME
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
bought O
the O
boy O
plenty O
of O
picture O
- O
books O
, O
and O
crammed O
his O
nursery O
with O
toys O
. O
Its O
walls O
were O
covered O
with O
pictures O
pasted O
up O
by O
the O
father’s O
own O
hand O
, O
and O
purchased O
by O
him O
for O
ready O
money O
. O
When O
he O
was O
off O
duty O
with O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
in O
the O
Park O
, O
he O
would O
sit O
up O
here O
, O
passing O
hours O
with O
the O
boy O
| | O
who O
rode O
on O
his O
chest O
, O
who O
pulled O
his O
great O
mustachios O
as O
if O
they O
were O
driving O
- O
reins O
, O
and O
spent O
days O
with O
him O
in O
indefatigable O
gambols O
. O
The O
room O
was O
a O
low O
room O
, O
and O
once O
, O
when O
the O
child O
was O
not O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
his O
father O
, O
who O
was O
tossing O
him O
wildly O
up O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
hit O
the O
poor O
little O
chap’s O
skull O
so O
violently O
against O
the O
ceiling O
that O
he O
almost O
dropped O
the O
child O
, O
so O
terrified O
was O
he O
at O
the O
disaster O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
minor O
had O
made O
up O
his O
face O
for O
a O
tremendous O
howl O
— O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
blow O
indeed O
authorized O
that O
indulgence O

but O
just O
as O
he O
was O
going O
to O
begin O
, O
the O
father O
interposed O
. O
“ O
For O
God’s O
sake O
, O
Rawdy S-PERSON
, O
don’t O
wake O
mamma O
, O
” O
he O
cried O
. O
And O
the O
child O
, O
looking O
in O
a O
very O
hard O
and O
piteous O
way O
at O
his O
father O
, O
bit O
his O
lips O
, O
clenched O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
didn’t O
cry O
a O
bit O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
told O
that O
story O
at O
the O
clubs O
, O
at O
the O
mess O
, O
to O
everybody O
in O
town O
. O
“ O
By O
Gad S-PERSON
, O
sir O
, O
” O
he O
explained O
to O
the O
public O
in O
general O
, O
“ O
what O
a O
good O
plucked O
one O
that O
boy O
of O
mine O
is O
— O
what O
a O
trump O
he O
is O
! O
— O
I O
half O
sent O
his O
head O
through O
the O
ceiling O
, O
by O
Gad S-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
wouldn’t O
cry O
for O
fear O
of O
disturbing O
his O
mother O
. O
” O
Sometimes O
— O
once O
or O
twice O
in O
a O
week O
— O
that O
lady O
visited O
the O
upper O
regions O
in O
which O
the O
child O
lived O
. O
She O
came O
like O
a O
vivified O
figure O
out O
of O
the O
Magasin B-WORK_OF_ART

blandly O
smiling O
in O
the O
most O
beautiful O

little O
gloves O
and O
boots O
. O
Wonderful O
scarfs O
, O
laces O
, O
and O
jewels O
glittered O
about O
her O
. O
She O
had O
always O
a O
new O
bonnet O
on O
: O
and O
flowers O
bloomed O
perpetually O
in O
it O
: O
or O
else O
magnificent O
curling O
ostrich O
feathers O
, O
soft O
and O
snowy O
as O
camellias O
. O
She O
nodded O
twice O
or O
thrice O
patronisingly O
to O
the O
little O
boy O
, O
who O
looked O
up O
from O
his O
dinner O
or O
from O
the O
pictures O
of O
soldiers O
he O
was O
painting O
. O
When O
she O
left O
the O
room O
, O
an O
odour O
of O
rose O
, O
or O
some O
other O
magical O
fragrance O
, O
lingered O
about O
the O
nursery O
. O
She O
was O
an O
unearthly O
being O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
superior O
to O
his O
father O
— O
to O
all O
the O
world O
: O
to O
be O
worshipped O

admired O
at O
a O
distance O

To O
drive O
with O
that O
lady O
in O
the O
carriage O
was O
an O
awful O
rite O
: O
he O
sate O
up O
in O
the O
back O
seat O
, O
and O
did O
not O
dare O
to O

: O
he O
gazed O
with O
all O
his O
eyes O
at O
the O
beautifully O
dressed O
princess O
opposite O
to O
him O
. O
Gentlemen O
on O
splendid O
prancing O
horses O
came O
up O
and O
smiled O
and O
talked O
with O
her O
. O
How O
her O
eyes O
beamed O
upon O
all O
of O
them O
! O
Her O
hand O
used O
to O
quiver O

wave O
gracefully O
as O
they O
passed O
. O
When O
he O
went O
out O
with O
her O
he O
had O
his O
new O
red O
dress O
on O
. O
His O
old O
brown O
holland O
was O
good O
enough O
when O
he O
stayed O
at O
home O

Sometimes O
, O
when O
she O
was O
away O

making O
his O
bed O
, O
he O
came O
into O
his O
mother’s O
room O
. O
It O
was O
as O
the O
abode O
of O
a O
fairy O
to O
him O
— O
a O
mystic O
chamber O
of O
splendour O

delights O

There O
in O
the O
wardrobe O
hung O
those O
wonderful O
robes O
— O
pink O

blue O
, O
and O
many O

There O
was O
the O
jewel O

the O
wondrous O
bronze O

on O
the O
dressing O

table O
, O
glistening O
all O
over O
with O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL

There O
was O
the O
cheval O
- O
glass O
, O
that O
miracle O
of O
art O
, O
in O
which O
he O
could O
just O
see O
his O
own O
wondering O
head O
, O

the O
reflection O
of O
Dolly S-PERSON

thou O
poor O
lonely O
little O
benighted O
boy O

Now O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
rascal O
as O
the O
Colonel O
was O
, O
had O
certain O
manly O
tendencies O

affection O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
could O
love O
a O
child O

a O
woman O
still O
. O
For O
Rawdon S-PERSON
minor O
he O
had O
a O
great O
secret O
tenderness O
then O
, O
which O
did O
not O
escape O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
talk O
about O
it O
to O
her O
husband O

It O
did O
not O
annoy O
her O
: O
she O
was O
too O
good O
- O
natured O
. O
It O
only O
increased O
her O
scorn O
for O
him O
. O
He O
felt O
somehow O
ashamed O
of O
this O
paternal O
softness O
, O
and O
hid O
it O
from O
his O
wife O
— O
only O
indulging O
in O
it O
when O
alone O
with O
the O
boy O

He O
used O
to O
take O
him O
out O
of O
mornings O

would O
go O
to O
the O

Rawdon’s S-NORP
great O
father O
was O
pleased O
to O
mount O
the O
boy O
, O
and O
to O
walk O
by O
his O
side O
in O
the O
Park O
. O
It O
pleased O
him O
to O
see O
his O
old O
quarters O
, O
and O
his O
old O
fellow O
- O
guardsmen O
at O
Knightsbridge S-GPE
: O
he O
had O
begun O
to O
think O
of O
his O
bachelorhood O
with O
something O
like O
regret O
. O
The O
old O
troopers O
were O
glad O
to O
recognize O
their O
ancient O
officer O
, O
and O
dandle O
the O
little O
Colonel O
. O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
found O
dining O
at O
mess O
and O
with O
his O
brother O
- O
officers O
very O
pleasant O
. O
“ O
Hang O
it O
, O
I O
ain’t O
clever O
enough O
for O
her O
— O
I O
know O
it O
. O
She O
won’t O
miss O
me O
, O
” O
he O
used O
to O
say O
: O
and O
he O
was O
right O
, O
his O
wife O
did O
not O
miss O
him O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
fond O
of O
her O
husband O
. O
She O
was O
always O
perfectly O
good O
- O
humoured O
and O
kind O
to O
him O
. O
She O
did O
not O
even O
show O
her O
scorn O
much O
for O
him O
| | O
perhaps O
she O
liked O
him O
the O
better O
for O
being O
a O
fool O
. O
He O
was O
her O
upper O
servant O
and O
maïtre O
d’hôtel O
. O
He O
went O
on O
her O
errands O
: O
obeyed O
her O
orders O
without O
question O
: O
drove O
in O
the O
carriage O
in O
the O
ring O
with O
her O
without O
repining O
| | O
took O
her O
to O
the O
Opera- O
box O
| | O
solaced O
himself O
at O
his O
club O
during O
the O
performance O
, O
and O
came O
punctually O
back O
to O
fetch O
her O
when O
due O
. O
He O
would O
have O
liked O
her O
to O
be O
a O
little O
fonder O
of O
the O
boy O
: O
but O
even O
to O
that O
he O
reconciled O
himself O
. O
“ O
Hang O
it O
, O
you O
know O
she’s O
so O
clever O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
and O
I’m O
not O
literary O
and O
that O
, O
you O
know O
. O
” O
For O
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
before O
, O
it O
requires O
no O
great O
wisdom O
to O
be O
able O
to O
win O
at O
cards O
and O
billiards O
, O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
made O
no O
pretentions O
to O
any O
other O
sort O
of O
skill O
. O
When O
the O
companion O
came O
, O
his O
domestic O
duties O
became O
very O
light O
. O
His O
wife O
encouraged O
him O
to O
dine O
abroad O
: O
she O
would O
let O
him O
off O
duty O
at O
the O
Opera S-FAC
. O
“ O
Don’t O
stay O

stupefy O
yourself O
at O
home O

night O
, O
my O

she O
would O
say O

“ O

thought O
Mrs. O

to O
herself O

The O
notion O
tickled O
hugely O
her O
sense O
of O

One B-TIME
Sunday I-TIME

, O
as O
Rawdon B-PERSON

who O
held O
a O

in O
his O

about O
the O
age O
of O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
. O
This O
other O

had O
seized O
hold O
of O
the O
Waterloo S-GPE
medal O
which O
the O
Corporal O

was O

it O
with O
delight O

“ O

to O

not O
long O

Either O
his O

up O

St. B-GPE
Helena E-GPE

where O
Jos S-PERSON

To O
hear O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
talk O
on O
board O
ship O
you O
would O
have O
supposed O
that O
it O
was O
not O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
he O

He O
had O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL

famous O

knew O
the O

the O
loss O

each O
had O

He O
did O
not O
deny O
that O
he O

concerned O
in O
those O

that O
he O
had O

carried O
despatches O
for O
the B-ORG
Duke I-ORG

such O
an O

knowledge O

his O
Grace’s S-PERSON
sentiments O

that O
it O
was O

been O
by O

” O
and O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
tossed O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
hissing O
out O
the O
word O
poison O
, O
once O
more O
, O
and O
so O
ending O
her O
charitable O
benediction O
. O
Till O
the O
termination O
of O
her O
natural O
life O
, O
this O
breach O
between O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
and O
her O
daughter O
was O
never O
thoroughly O
mended O
. O
The O
quarrel O
gave O
the O
elder O
lady O
numberless O
advantages O
which O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
turn O
to O
account O
with O
female O
ingenuity O
and O
perseverance O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
she O
scarcely O
spoke O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
for O
many B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
afterwards O
. O
She O
warned O
the O
domestics O
not O
to O
touch O
the O
child O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
might O
be O
offended O
. O
She O
asked O
her O
daughter O
to O
see O
and O
satisfy O
herself O
that O
there O
was O
no O
poison O
prepared O
in O
the O
little O
daily O
messes O
that O
were O
concocted O
for O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
When O
neighbours O
asked O
after O
the O
boy’s O
health O
, O
she O
referred O
them O
pointedly O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
She O
never O
ventured O
to O
ask O
whether O
the O
baby O
was O
well O
or O
not O
. O
She O
would O
not O
touch O
the O
child O
, O
although O
he O
was O
her O
grandson O
, O
and O
own O
precious O
darling O
, O
for O
she O
was O
not O
used O
to O
children O
, O
and O
might O
kill O
it O
. O
And O
whenever O
Mr. O
Pestler S-PERSON
came O
upon O
his O
healing O
inquisition O
, O
she O
received O
the O
Doctor O
with O
such O
a O
sarcastic O
and O
scornful O
demeanour O
, O
as O
made O
the O
surgeon O
declare O
that O
not O
Lady O
Thistlewood S-PERSON
herself O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
attending O
professionally O
, O
could O
give O
herself O
greater O
airs O
than O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
from O
whom O
he O
never O
took O
a O
fee O
. O
And O
very O
likely O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
jealous O
too O
, O
upon O
her O
own O
part O
, O
as O
what O
mother O
is O
not O
, O
of O
those O
who O
would O
manage O
her O
children O
for O
her O
, O
or O
become O
candidates O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
in O
their O
affections O
? O
It O
is O
certain O
that O
when O
anybody O
nursed O
the O
child O
, O
she O
was O
uneasy O
, O
and O
that O
she O
would O
no O
more O
allow O
Mrs. O
Clapp S-PERSON
or O
the O
domestic O
to O
dress O
or O
tend O
him O
, O
than O
she O
would O
have O
let O
them O
wash O
her O
husband’s O
miniature O
which O
hung O
up O
over O
her O
little O
bed O
: O
— O
the O
same O
little O
bed O
from O
which O
the O
poor O
girl O
had O
gone O
to O
his O
| | O
and O
to O
which O
she O
retired O
now O
for O
many O
long O
, O
silent O
, O
tearful O
, O
but O
happy O
years O
. O
In O
this O
room O
was O
all O
Amelia’s O
heart O
and O
treasure O
. O
Here O
it O
was O
that O
she O
tended O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
watched O
him O
through O
the O
many O
ills O
of O
childhood O
, O
with O
a O
constant O
passion O
of O
love O
. O
The O
elder O
George S-PERSON
returned O
in O
him O
somehow O
, O
only O
improved O
, O
and O
as O
if O
come O
back O
from O
heaven O
. O
In O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
little O
tones O
, O
looks O
, O
and O
movements O
, O
the O
child O
was O
so O
like O
his O
father O
, O
that O
the O
widow’s O
heart O
thrilled O
as O
she O
held O
him O
to O
it O
| | O
and O
he O
would O
often O
ask O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
tears O
. O
It O
was O
because O
of O
his O
likeness O
to O
his O
father O
, O
she O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
tell O
him O
. O
She O
talked O
constantly O
to O
him O
about O
this O
dead O
father O
, O
and O
spoke O
of O
her O
love O
for O
George S-PERSON
to O
the O
innocent O
and O
wondering O
child O
| | O
much O
more O
than O
she O
ever O
had O
done O
to O
George S-PERSON
himself O
, O
or O
to O
any O
confidante O
of O
her O
youth O
. O
To O
her O
parents O
she O
never O
talked O
about O
this O
matter O
| | O
shrinking O
from O
baring O
her O
heart O
to O
them O
. O
Little O
George S-PERSON
very O
likely O
could O
understand O
no O
better O
than O
they O
| | O
but O
into O
his O
ears O
she O
poured O
her O
sentimental O
secrets O
unreservedly O
, O
and O
into O
his O
only O
. O
The O
very O
joy O
of O
this O
woman O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
grief O
, O
or O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
its O
expression O
was O
tears O
. O
Her O
sensibilities O
were O
so O
weak O
and O
tremulous O
, O
that O
perhaps O
they O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
talked O
about O
in O
a O
book O
. O
I O
was O
told O
by O
Dr. O
Pestler S-PERSON
( O
now O
a O
most O
flourishing O
lady’s O
physician O
, O
with O
a O
sumptuous O
dark O
green O
carriage O
, O
a O
prospect O
of O
speedy O
knighthood O
, O
and O
a O
house O
in O
Manchester B-FAC
Square E-FAC
) O
, O
that O
her O
grief O
at O
weaning O
the O
child O
was O
a O
sight O
that O
would O
have O
unmanned O
a O
Herod S-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
and O
, O
his O
wife O
was O
mortally O
jealous O
of O
Mrs. O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
then O
and O
long O
afterwards O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
Doctor’s O
lady O
had O
good O
reason O
for O
her O
jealousy O
: O
most O
women O
shared O
it O
, O
of O
those O
who O
formed O
the O
small O
circle O
of O
Amelia’s S-NORP
acquaintance O
, O
and O
were O
quite O
angry O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
the O
other O
sex O
regarded O
her O
. O
For O
almost O
all O
men O
who O
came O
near O
her O
loved O
her O
| | O
though O
no O
doubt O
they O
would O
be O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
She O
was O
not O
brilliant O
, O
nor O
witty O
, O
nor O
wise O
over O
much O
, O
nor O
extraordinarily O
handsome O
. O
But O
wherever O
she O
went O
she O
touched O
and O
charmed O
every O
one O
of O
the O
male O
sex O
, O
as O
invariably O
as O
she O
awakened O
the O
scorn O
and O
incredulity O
of O
her O
own O
sisterhood O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
her O
weakness O
which O
was O
her O
principal O
charm O
: O
— O
a O
kind O
of O
sweet O
submission O
and O
softness O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
appeal O
to O
each O
man O
she O
met O
for O
his O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
in O
the O
regiment O
, O
though O
she O
spoke O
to O
but O
few O
of O
George’s S-NORP
comrades O
there O
, O
all O
the O
swords O
of O
the O
young O
fellows O
at O
the O
mess O
- O
table O
would O
have O
leapt O
from O
their O
scabbards O
to O
fight O
round O
her O
| | O
and O
so O
it O
was O
in O
the O
little O
narrow O
lodging O
- O
house O
and O
circle O
at O
Fulham S-GPE
, O
she O
interested O
and O
pleased O
everybody O
. O
If O
she O
had O
been O
Mrs. O
Mango S-PERSON
herself O
, O
of O
the O
great O
house O
of O
Mango B-ORG
, I-ORG
Plantain I-ORG
, I-ORG
and I-ORG
Co. E-ORG
, O
Crutched B-PERSON
Friars E-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
magnificent O
proprietress O
of O
the O
Pineries S-NORP
, O
Fulham S-PERSON
, O
who O
gave O
summer O
déjeuners O
frequented O
by O
Dukes S-PERSON
and O
Earls S-PERSON
, O
and O
drove O
about O
the O
parish O
with O
magnificent O
yellow O
liveries O
and O
bay O
horses O
, O
such O
as O
the O
royal O
stables O
at O
Kensington S-GPE
themselves O
could O
not O
turn O
out O
— O
I O
say O
had O
she O
been O
Mrs. O
Mango S-PERSON
herself O
, O
or O
her O
son’s O
wife O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Mary I-PERSON

, O
who O
condescended O
to O
marry O
the O
head O
of O
the O
firm O

, O
the O
tradesmen O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
could O
not O
pay O
her O
more O
honour O
than O
they O
invariably O
showed O
to O
the O
gentle O
young O
widow O

when O
she O
passed O
by O
their O
doors O
, O
or O
made O
her O
humble O
purchases O
at O
their O

Thus O
it O
was O
not O
only O
Mr. O
Pestler S-PERSON
, O
the O
medical O
man O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Linton S-PERSON
the O
young O
assistant O
, O
who O
doctored O
the O
servant O
maids O
and O
small O
tradesmen O
, O
and O
might O
be O
seen O
any O
day O
reading O
the O
Times S-ORG
in O
the O
surgery O
, O
who O
openly O
declared O
himself O
the O
slave O
of O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON

He O
was O
a O
personable O
young O
gentleman O
, O
more O
welcome O
at O
Mrs. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
lodgings O
than O
his O
principal O
| | O
and O
if O
anything O
went O
wrong O
with O
Georgy S-PERSON
, O
he O
would O
drop O
in O
twice O
or O
thrice O
in O
the O
day O
, O
to O
see O
the O
little O
chap O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
the O
thought O
of O
a O
fee O

He O
would O
abstract O
lozenges O
, O
tamarinds O
, O
and O
other O
produce O
from O
the O
surgery O
- O
drawers O
for O
little O
Georgy’s O
benefit O
, O
and O
compound O
draughts O
and O
mixtures O
for O
him O
of O
miraculous O
sweetness O
, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
pleasure O
to O
the O
child O
to O
be O
ailing O
. O
He O
and O
Pestler S-PERSON
, O
his O
chief O

sat O
up O
two S-CARDINAL
whole O
nights O
by O
the O
boy O
in O
that O
momentous O
and O
awful O
week O
when O
Georgy S-PERSON
had O
the O
measles O

and O
when O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
, O
from O
the O
mother’s O
terror O
, O
that O
there O
had O
never O
been O
measles O
in O
the O
world O
before O
. O
Would O
they O
have O
done O
as O
much O
for O
other O
people O

Did O
they O
sit O
up O
for O
the O
folks O
at O
the O
Pineries S-FAC

when O
Ralph B-PERSON
Plantagenet E-PERSON

Gwendoline S-PERSON

Guinever B-PERSON
Mango E-PERSON
had O
the O

juvenile O
complaint O

Did O
they O
sit O
up O
for O
little O
Mary B-PERSON
Clapp E-PERSON
, O
the O
landlord’s O
daughter O
, O
who O
actually O
caught O
the O
disease O
of O
little O
Georgy S-PERSON

Truth O
compels O
one O
to O
say O

no O

They O
slept O
quite O
undisturbed O
, O

Mr. O

some O

strongly O

Sedley S-PERSON
pursued O
the O
Major O
. O
As O
his O

he O
demanded O
with O
a O

a O
statement O

Dobbin’s S-PERSON
stammering O
, O
blushing O

added O
to O
the O

that O
he O
had O
a O
rogue O
to O
deal O
with O

in O
a O
majestic O

told O

a O
piece O

his O
mind O

he O
called O
it O

Dobbin S-PERSON
at O
this O

up O

took O
his O

He O
ruled O
all O

round O

As O
he O
grew O

the O

He O
asked O

inquiring O

The O
profundity O
of O
his O
remarks O

astonished O
his O
old O

perfectly O
bored O

suffered O

The O
small O

Georgy S-PERSON

perhaps O
thought O

Dobbin S-PERSON

would O
call O
in O
the O
family O
carriage O
to O
take O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
the O
little O
boy O
for O
a O
drive O
if O
they O
were O
so O
inclined O
. O
The O
patronage O
and O
kindness O
of O
these O
ladies O
was O
very O
uncomfortable O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
bore O
it O
meekly O
enough O
, O
for O
her O
nature O
was O
to O
yield O

and O
, O
besides O
, O
the O
carriage O
and O
its O
splendours O
gave O
little O
Georgy S-PERSON
immense O
pleasure O
. O
The O
ladies O
begged O
occasionally O
that O
the O
child O
might O
pass O
a O
day O
with O
them O
, O
and O
he O
was O
always O
glad O
to O
go O
to O
that O
fine O
garden O
- O
house O
at O
Denmark B-FAC
Hill E-FAC
, O
where O
they O
lived O
, O
and O
where O
there O
were O
such O
fine O
grapes O
in O
the O
hot O
- O
houses O
and O
peaches O
on O
the O
walls O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
day O
they O
kindly O
came O
over O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
with O
news O
which O
they O
were O
sure O
would O
delight O
her O
— O
something O
very O
interesting O
about O
their O
dear O
William S-PERSON
. O
“ O
What O
was O
it O
: O
was O
he O
coming O
home O
? O
” O
she O
asked O
with O
pleasure O
beaming O
in O
her O
eyes O
. O
“ O
O O
, O
no O
— O
not O
the O
least O
— O
but O
they O
had O
very O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
dear O
William S-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
be O
married O
— O
and O
to O
a O
relation O
of O
a O
very O
dear O
friend O

a O
very O
beautiful O

everybody O
said O

” O
Amelia S-PERSON
said O
“ O
Oh O
! O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
very O
very O
happy O
indeed O
. O
But O
she O
supposed O
Glorvina S-PERSON
could O
not O
be O
like O
her O
old O
acquaintance O
, O
who O
was O
most O
kind O
— O
but O
— O
but O
she O
was O
very O
happy O
indeed O

And O
by O
some O
impulse O
of O
which O
I O
cannot O
explain O
the O
meaning O
, O
she O
took O
George S-PERSON
in O
her O
arms O
and O
kissed O
him O
with O
an O
extraordinary O
tenderness O
. O
Her O
eyes O
were O
quite O
moist O
when O
she O
put O
the O
child O
down O

and O
she O
scarcely O
spoke O
a O
word O
during O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
drive O

though O
she O
was O
so O

happy O
indeed O

OUR O
duty O
now O
takes O
us O
back O
for O
a O
brief O
space O
to O
some O
old O
Hampshire S-GPE
acquaintances O
of O
ours O
, O
whose O
hopes O
respecting O
the O
disposal O
of O
their O
rich O
kinswoman’s O
property O
were O
so O
wofully O
disappointed O

After O
counting O
upon O
thirty B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
from O
his O
sister O
, O
it O
was O
a O
heavy O
blow O
to O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
to O
receive O
but O
five S-CARDINAL

out O
of O
which O
sum O

when O
he O
had O
paid O
his O
own O
debts O
and O
those O
of O
Jim S-PERSON
, O
his O
son O
at O
college O
, O
a O
very O
small O
fragment O
remained O
to O
portion O
off O
his O
four S-CARDINAL
plain O
daughters O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
never O
knew O
, O
or O
at O
least O
never O
acknowledged O
, O
how O
far O
her O
own O
tyrannous O
behaviour O
had O
tended O
to O
ruin O
her O

All O
that O
woman O
could O
do O
, O
she O
vowed O
and O
protested O
she O
had O
done O
. O
Was O
it O
her O
fault O
if O
she O
did O
not O
possess O
those O
sycophantic O
arts O
which O
her O
hypocritical O
nephew O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
practised O
? O
She O
wished O
him O
all O
the O

he O
merited O
out O
of O

“ O
At O

the O
money O
will O
remain O
in O
the O

she O
said O

charitably O

“ O
Pitt S-PERSON
will O
never O
spend O
it O

my O
dear O

that O

, O
as O
his O
spendthrift O
brother O
, O
the O
abandoned O
Rawdon S-PERSON

” O
So O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
, O
after O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
shock O
of O
rage O
and O
disappointment O
, O
began O
to O
accommodate O
herself O
as O
best O
she O
could O
to O
her O
altered O
fortunes O
, O
and O
to O
save O
and O
retrench O
with O
all O
her O
might O
. O
She O
instructed O
her O
daughters O
how O
to O
bear O
poverty O
cheerfully O
, O
and O
invented O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
notable O
methods O
to O
conceal O
or O
evade O
it O
. O
She O
took O
them O
about O
to O
balls O
and O
public O
places O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
with O
praiseworthy O
energy O
: O
nay O
, O
she O
entertained O
her O
friends O
in O
a O
hospitable O
comfortable O
manner O
at O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
, O
and O
much O
more O
frequently O
than O
before O
dear O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
legacy O
had O
fallen O
in O
. O
From O
her O
outward O
bearing O
nobody O
would O
have O
supposed O
that O
the O
family O
had O
been O
disappointed O
in O
their O
expectations O
: O
or O
have O
guessed O
from O
her O
frequent O
appearance O
in O
public O
how O
she O
pinched O
and O
starved O
at O
home O
. O
Her O
girls O
had O
more O
milliners’ O
furniture O
than O
they O
had O
ever O
enjoyed O
before O
. O
They O
appeared O
perseveringly O
at O
the O
Winchester S-GPE
and O
Southampton S-GPE
assemblies O

they O
penetrated O
to O
Cowes S-GPE
for O
the O
race O
- O
balls O
and O
regatta O
- O
gaieties O
there O

and O
their O
carriage O
, O
with O
the O
horses O
taken O
from O
the O
plough O
, O
was O
at O
work O
perpetually O
, O
until O
it O
began O
almost O
to O
be O
believed O
that O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
sisters O
had O
had O
fortunes O
left O
them O
by O
their O
aunt O
, O
whose O
name O
the O

never O
mentioned O
in O
public O
but O
with O
the O
most O
tender O
gratitude O
and O
regard O
. O
I O
know O
no O
sort O
of O
lying O
which O
is O
more O
frequent O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
than O
this O
| | O
and O
it O
may O
be O
remarked O
how O
people O
who O
practise O
it O
take O
credit O
to O
themselves O
for O
their O
hypocrisy O
, O
and O
fancy O
that O
they O
are O
exceedingly O
virtuous O
and O
praiseworthy O
, O
because O
they O
are O
able O
to O
deceive O
the O
world O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
their O
means O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
certainly O
thought O
herself O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
virtuous O
women O
in O
England S-GPE
, O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
happy O
family O
was O
an O
edifying O
one O
to O
strangers O
. O
They O
were O
so O
cheerful O
, O
so O
loving O
, O
so O
well O
- O
educated O
, O
so O
simple O
! O
Martha S-PERSON
painted O
flowers O
exquisitely O
, O
and O
furnished O
half S-CARDINAL

and O
her O
verses O
in O
the O

were O
the O
glory O
of O
its O
Poet’s B-FAC
Corner E-FAC

Fanny S-PERSON

Matilda S-PERSON
sang O
duets O
together O

round O

Nobody O
saw O
the O
poor O

drumming O
at O
the O

No O

them O
rigidly O
hour B-TIME
after I-TIME

In O
a O
word O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
put O
a O
good O
face O
against O
fortune O
, O
and O
kept O
up O
appearances O
in O
the O
most O
virtuous O
manner O

Everything O
that O
a O
good O
and O
respectable O
mother O
could O
do O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
did O
. O
She O
got O
over O
yachting O
men O
from O
Southampton S-GPE
, O
parsons O
from O
the B-FAC

officers O
from O

She O
tried O
to O
inveigle O
the O
young O
barristers O
at O
assizes O

and O
encouraged O
Jim S-PERSON

he O
went O
out O
hunting O

What O
will O
not O
a O

for O
the O

the O
odious O

is O
manifest O

The O
rupture O
between O
Bute S-PERSON

his O
brother O
Sir O

was O
complete O

indeed O

between O

the O
whole O
county O

the O
old O
man O
was O
a O
scandal O

His O
dislike O

increased O
with O
age O

an O
awful O

never O

thought O
of O
by O
the O

without O
horror O

Pitt S-PERSON
begged O
his O

with O
a O
ghastly O
countenance O
, O
never O
to O

of O
it O

and O
it O
was O
only O
through O
Mrs. O

herself O
, O
who O
still O
knew O
everything O
which O
took O

at O

As O
they O
drove O
up O
the O

the O
park O
in O
their O
neat O
and O
well O
- O
appointed O
carriage O
, O
Pitt S-PERSON
remarked O
with O
dismay O
and O
wrath O
great O
gaps O
among O
the O
trees O
— O
his O
trees O
, O
— O
which O
the O
old O
Baronet S-PERSON
was O
felling O
entirely O
without O
license O
. O
The O
park O
wore O
an O
aspect O
of O
utter O
dreariness O
and O
ruin O
. O
The O
drives O
were O
ill O

kept O
, O
and O
the O
neat O
carriage O
splashed O
and O
floundered O
in O
muddy O
pools O
along O
the O
road O

The O
great O
sweep O
in O
front O
of O
the O

up O

the O

line O
of O
the O
house O

the O
great O

was O
unbarred O
after O
much O
ringing O
of O
the O
bell O

an O
individual O
in O
ribbons O
was O
seen O
flitting O
up O
the O
black O
oak O
stair O
, O
as O
Horrocks S-PERSON
at O
length O
admitted O
the O

as O
it O
was O
called O

growing O

Pitt S-PERSON

“ O
Sir O

ain’t O
very O
well O

Horrocks S-PERSON
remarked O
apologetically O

hinted O
that O
his O
master O

afflicted O
with O
lumbago O

The O
library O
looked O
out O
on O
the O

Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
had O
opened O

was O
bawling O
out O
thence O
to O
the O
postilion O

Pitt’s S-PERSON
servant O

down O

“ O
Don’t S-PERSON

he O
cried O

pointing O
with O

Pitt S-PERSON
once O

clapping O

on O
a O

Sir O

called O
the O
small O

” O
It O
may O
have O
been O
shame O

it O
may O
have O
been O
dislike O

the O
old O
Cynic O

Crawley E-PERSON
hardly O
issued O
from O
his O
park O

He O
quarrelled O
with O
his O
agents O

screwed O
his O
tenants O
by O
letter O

His O
days O

passed O

through O

commanded O
the O
back O

admitted O

so O
the O
Baronet’s S-PERSON
daily O
perplexities O
increased O

his O
embarrassments O
multiplied O
round O
him O

The O
horror O
of O
Pitt B-PERSON

may O
be O
imagined O
, O
as O
these O
reports O
of O
his O
father’s O
dotage O
reached O
the O
most O
exemplary O

correct O
of O
gentlemen O

He O
trembled O
daily S-DATE
lest O

his O
father’s O
name O
was O
never O
mentioned O

It O
was O
the O
skeleton O
in O
his O
house O

all O
the O

walked O
by O
it O

terror O

silence O

The B-ORG

old O
Sir O

chuckled O

imitations O

He O

take O
possession O

And O
it O

Though O
the O
good O
people O
of O
the O
Parsonage O
never O
went O
to O
the O
Hall O
, O
and O
shunned O
the O
horrid O
old O
dotard O
its O
owner O
, O
yet O
they O
kept O
a O
strict O
knowledge O
of O
all O
that O
happened O
there O
, O
and O
were O
looking O
out O
every O
day O
for O
the O
catastrophe O
for O
which O
Miss O
Horrocks S-PERSON
was O
also O
eager O

But O
fate O
intervened O
enviously O
, O
and O
prevented O
her O
from O
receiving O
the O
reward O
due O
to O
such O
immaculate O
love O
and O
virtue O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
day O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
surprised O
“ O
her O

” O
as O
he O
jocularly O
called O
her O
, O
seated O
at O
that O
old O
and O
tuneless O
piano O
in O
the O
drawing O

room O
, O
which O
had O
scarcely O
been O
touched O
since O
Becky B-PERSON
Sharp E-PERSON
played O
quadrilles O
upon O
it O
— O
seated O
at O
the O
piano O
with O
the O
utmost O
gravity O
, O
and O
squalling O
to O
the O
best O
of O
her O
power O
in O
imitation O
of O
the O
music O
which O
she O
had O
sometimes O
heard O
. O
The O
little O
kitchen O
- O
maid O
on O
her O
promotion O
was O
standing O
at O
her O
mistress’s O
side O
, O
quite O
delighted O
during O
the O
operation O
, O
and O
wagging O
her O
head O
up O
and O
down O
, O

crying O
, O
“ O
Lor O

” O
— O
just O

genteel O
sycophant O
in O
a O
real O
drawing O

room O

This O
incident O
made O
the O
old O
Baronet S-PERSON
roar O
with O
laughter O
, O
as O
usual O
. O
He O
narrated O
the O
circumstance O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
times O
to O
Horrocks S-PERSON
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
greatly O
to O
the O
discomfiture O
of O
Miss O
Horrocks S-PERSON
. O
He O
thrummed O
on O
the O
table O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
a O
musical O
instrument O
, O
and O
squalled O
in O
imitation O
of O
her O
manner O
of O
singing O
. O
He O
vowed O
that O
such O
a O
beautiful O
voice O
ought O
to O
be O
cultivated O
, O
and O
declared O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
singing O
- O
masters O
, O
in O
which O
proposals O
she O
saw O
nothing O
ridiculous O
. O
He O
was O
in O
great O
spirits O
that O
night O

and O
drank O
with O
his O
friend O

butler O
an O
extraordinary O
quantity O
of O
rum-and O
- O
water O

at O
a B-TIME
very I-TIME
late I-TIME
hour E-TIME
the O
faithful O

domestic O
conducted O
his O
master O
to O
his O
bedroom O

Half B-TIME
an I-TIME

afterwards O
there O
was O
a O
great O
hurry O

Lights O
went O
about O
from O

ordinarily O
occupied O

Presently O

galloping O
off O

And O
in O
another B-TIME

entered O

on O

through O
that O

into O
Sir O

they O
found O
Miss O

with O
a O

with O
a O

She O
dropped O
them O
with O
a O
scream O

, O
as O
little O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
eyes O
flashed O
out O
at O

“ O

cried O
Mrs. O

pointing O
at O

Bute S-PERSON
went O
upstairs O

and O
found O
the O
Doctor O
from O
Mudbury S-GPE
, O
with O
the O
frightened O
Horrocks S-PERSON
over O
his O
master O
in O
a O
chair O
. O
They O
were O
trying O
to O
bleed O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
. O
With O
the B-TIME
early I-TIME
morning E-TIME
an O
express O
was O
sent O
off O
to O
Mr. O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
by O
the O
Rector’s S-ORG
lady O
, O
who O
assumed O
the O
command O
of O
everything O
, O
and O
had O
watched O
the O
old O
Baronet S-PERSON
through O
the O
night O
. O
He O
had O
been O
brought O
back O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
life O
| | O
he O
could O
not O
speak O
, O
but O
seemed O
to O
recognise O
people O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
kept O
resolutely O
by O
his O
bed- O
side O
. O
She O
never O
seemed O
to O
want O
to O
sleep O
, O
that O
little O
woman O
, O
and O
did O
not O
close O
her O
fiery O
black O
eyes O
once O
, O
though O
the O
Doctor O
snored O
in O
the O
armchair O
. O
Horrocks S-PERSON
made O
some O
wild O
efforts O
to O
assert O
his O
authority O
and O
assist O
his O
master O
| | O
but O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
called O
him O
a O
tipsy O
old O
wretch O
, O
and O
bade O
him O
never O
show O
his O
face O
again O
in O
that O
house O
, O
or O
he O
should O
be O
transported O
like O
his O
abominable O
daughter O
. O
Terrified O
by O
her O
manner O
, O
he O
slunk O
down O
to O
the O
oak O
parlour O
where O
Mr. O
James S-PERSON
was O
, O
who O
, O
having O
tried O
the O
bottle O
standing O
there O
and O
found O
no O
liquor O
in O
it O
, O
ordered O
Mr. O
Horrocks S-PERSON
to O
get O
another O
bottle O
of O
rum O
, O
which O
he O
fetched O
, O
with O
clean O
glasses O
, O
and O
to O
which O
the O
Rector O
and O
his O
son O
sat O
down O
: O
ordering O
Horrocks S-PERSON
to O
put O
down O
the O
keys O
at O
that O
instant O
and O
never O
to O
show O
his O
face O
again O
. O
Cowed O
by O
this O
behaviour O
, O
Horrocks S-PERSON
gave O
up O
the O
keys O

and O
he O
and O
his O
daughter O
slunk O
off O
silently O
through O
the O
night O
, O
and O
gave O
up O
possession O
of O
the O
house O

in O
due O
time O
, O
after O
this O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
henceforth O
may O
be O
said O
to O
have O
reigned O
in O
Queen’s B-GPE
Crawley E-GPE

For O
though O
the O
old O
Baronet S-PERSON
survived O
many B-DATE
months E-DATE
, O
he O
never O
recovered O
the O
use O

completely O
, O
and O
the O
government O

In O
a O
strange O
condition O
Pitt S-PERSON
found O
it O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
always O
buying O
and O
mortgaging O

had O
twenty S-CARDINAL

To O
unravel O
these O
difficulties O
, O
and O
to O
set O
the O
estate O
clear O
, O
was O
a O
task O
worthy O
of O
the O
orderly O
and O
persevering O
diplomatist O
of O
Pumpernickel S-PERSON
: O
and O
he O
set O
himself O
to O
work O
with O
prodigious O
assiduity O
. O
His O
whole O
family O
, O
of O
course O
, O
was O
transported O
to O
Queen’s B-GPE
Crawley E-GPE
, O
whither O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
, O
of O
course O

came O
too O

and O
she O
set O
about O
converting O
the O
parish O
under O
the O
Rector’s O
nose O
, O
and O
brought O
down O
her O
irregular O
clergy O
to O
the O
dismay O
of O
the O
angry O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
had O
concluded O
no O

Queen’s B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON

when O
it O
should O
drop O

her O

proposed O

take O
the O
patronage O
into O
her O
own O
hands O
, O
and O
present O
a O
young O
protégé O
to O
the O
Rectory O

on O
which O
subject O
the O
diplomatic O
Pitt S-PERSON
said O
nothing O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
intentions O
with O
regard O
to O
Miss O
Betsy B-PERSON
Horrocks E-PERSON
were O
not O
carried O
into O
effect O
: O
and O
she O
paid O
no O
visit O
to O
Southampton B-FAC
Gaol E-FAC
. O
She O
and O
her O
father O
left O
the O
Hall S-FAC
, O
when O
the O
latter O
took O
possession O
of O
the B-FAC
Crawley I-FAC
Arms E-FAC
in O
the O
village O
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
got O
a O
lease O
from O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
. O
The O
ex-butler O
had O
obtained O
a O
small O
freehold O
there O
likewise O
, O
which O
gave O
him O
a O
vote O
for O
the O
borough O
. O
The O
Rector O
had O
another O
of O
these O
votes O
, O
and O
these O
and O
four S-CARDINAL
others O
formed O
the O
representative O
body O
which O
returned O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
members O
for O
Queen’s B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
. O
There O
was O
a O
show O
of O
courtesy O
kept O
up O
between O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
and O
the O
Hall O
ladies O
, O
between O
the O
younger O
ones O
at O
least O
, O
for O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
never O
could O
meet O
without O
battles O
, O
and O
gradually O
ceased O
seeing O
each O
other O
. O
Her O
Ladyship O
kept O
her O
room O
when O
the O
ladies O
from O
the O
Rectory O
visited O
their O
cousins O
at O
the O
Hall S-FAC
. O
Perhaps O
Mr. O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
not O
very O
much O
displeased O
at O
these O
occasional O
absences O
of O
his O
mamma O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
He O
believed O
the O
Binkie S-PERSON
family O
to O
be O
the O
greatest O
and O
wisest O
, O
and O
most O
interesting O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
her O
Ladyship S-PERSON
and O
his O
aunt O
had O
long O
held O
ascendency O
over O
him O
| | O
but O
sometimes O
he O
felt O
that O
she O
commanded O
him O
too O
much O
. O
To O
be O
considered O
young O
was O
complimentary O
doubtless O

but O
at O
six B-DATE
- I-DATE
and I-DATE
- I-DATE
forty E-DATE
to O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
boy O
was O
sometimes O
mortifying O
. O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
yielded O
up O
everything O
, O
however O
, O
to O
her O
mother O
. O
She O
was O
only O
fond O
of O
her O
children O
in O
private O

and O
it O
was O
lucky O
that O
Lady B-PERSON

the O
little O
Matilda S-PERSON

her O
grandson O

Master O

The O
latter O
was O
a O
feeble O
child O

it O
was O
only O
by O
prodigious O
quantities O

Lady B-PERSON

As O
for O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON

retired O

Lady B-PERSON

been O
previously O

At O
least O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
grumbled O
a O
good O

about O
paying O
half S-CARDINAL

the O
Baronet S-PERSON

Of O
sunshiny O
days O
this O
old O
gentleman O
was O
taken O
out O
in O
a O
chair O
on O
the O
terrace O
— O
the O
very O
chair O
which O
Miss O

had O
had O
at O
Brighton S-GPE

had O
been O
transported O

with O
a O
number O
of O
Lady O

effects O
to O
Queen’s B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON

Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
always O
walked O
by O
the O
old O
man O

and O
was O
an O
evident O
favourite O
with O
him O
. O
He O
used O
to O
nod O
many O
times O
to O
her O
and O
smile O
when O
she O
came O
in O
, O
and O
utter O
inarticulate O
deprecatory O
moans O
when O
she O
was O
going O
away O
. O
When O
the O
door O
shut O
upon O
her O
he O
would O
cry O
and O
sob O
— O
whereupon O
Hester’s S-PERSON
face O

manner O
, O
which O
was O
always O
exceedingly O
bland O

gentle O
while O
her O
lady O
was O
present O
, O
would O
change O
at O
once O

she O
would O
make O
faces O
at O
him O

clench O
her O
fist O

and O
scream O
out O
“ O
Hold O
your O
tongue O

you O
stoopid O
old O
fool O

twirl O
away O
his O
chair O
from O
the O
fire O
which O
he O
loved O
to O
look O
at O

at O
which O
he O
would O
cry O
more O

For O

all O

Hester S-PERSON
presented O
herself O
dropping O
a O
curtsey O

“ O

that O
made O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
pale O

Was O

laughed O
a O
great O
deal O

kissed O
the O
gentlewoman O

soon O
as O
they O

Briggs S-PERSON
told O
all O
her O
history O
amidst O
those O
perfectly O
uncalled O

for O
sobs O

ejaculations O

remembering O

So O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
Briggs S-PERSON
told O
all O
her O
history O

the O
hysterical O
sniffling O

giggling O

went O
on O

did O
not O

“ O

issued O
from O

only O
saluted O
the O
lady O
with O
a O
very O
sour O
curtsey O

and O
her O
fingers O
were O
like O
so O
many O
sausages O

cold O

lifeless O

when O
she O
held O
them O
out O

Mrs. O

who O
persisted O
in O
shaking O
hands O
with O
the O
retired O
lady’s O
maid O

She O
whirled O
away O
into O
Piccadilly S-GPE

nodding O
with O
the O
sweetest O
of O
smiles O
towards O
Miss O

who O
hung O
nodding O
at O
the O

close O
under O

at O
the O

Becky S-PERSON
instantly O
formed O
some O
benevolent O
little O
domestic O
plans O
concerning O
her O

This O
was O
just O
such O
a O
companion O
as O
would O
suit O
her O
establishment O

she O
invited O
Briggs S-PERSON
to O
come O
to O
dinner O
with O
her O
that O
very O
evening O

when O

Briggs S-PERSON
promised O
to O

lad O
who O
wrapped O
her O
in O
his O
coat O
on O
the O
journey O
! O
Rawdon S-PERSON
took O
his O
place O
outside O
, O
and O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
drive O
, O
but O
his O
grief O
forbade O
him O
. O
He O
sat O
by O
the O
coachman O
, O
and O
talked O
about O
horses O
and O
the O
road O
the O
whole O
way O
| | O
and O
who O
kept O
the O
inns O
, O
and O
who O
horsed O
the O
coach O
by O
which O
he O
had O
travelled O
so O
many O
a O
time O
, O
when O
he O
and O
Pitt S-PERSON
were O
boys O
going O
to O
Eton S-GPE
. O
At O
Mudbury S-GPE
a O
carriage O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
horses O
received O
them O
, O
with O
a O
coachman O
in O
black O
. O
“ O
It’s O
the O
old O
drag O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
as O
they O
got O
in O
. O
“ O
The O
worms O
have O
eaten O
the O
cloth O
a O
good O
deal O
— O
there’s O
the O
stain O
which O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
— O
ha O
! O
I O
see O
Dawson S-PERSON
the O
Ironmonger S-PERSON
has O
his O
shutters O
up O
— O
which O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
made O
such O
a O
noise O
about O
. O
It O
was O
a O
bottle O
of O
cherry O
brandy O
he O
broke O
which O
we O
went O
to O
fetch O
for O
your O
aunt O
from O
Southampton S-GPE

How O
time O
flies O

sure O

that O

Polly B-PERSON

that O
bouncing O
girl O
standing O
by O
her O
mother O
at O
the O
cottage O
there O
. O
I O
remember O
her O
a O
mangy O
little O
urchin O
picking O
weeds O
in O
the O
garden O
. O
” O
“ O
Fine O
gal O
, O
” O
said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
returning O
the O
salute O
which O
the O
cottage O
gave O
him O
, O
by O
two S-CARDINAL
fingers O
applied O
to O
his O
crape O
hatband O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
bowed O
and O
saluted O
, O
and O
recognised O
people O
here O
and O
there O
graciously O
. O
These O
recognitions O
were O
inexpressibly O
pleasant O
to O
her O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
she O
was O
not O
an O
impostor O
any O
more O
, O
and O
was O
coming O
to O
the O
home O
of O
her O
ancestors O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
rather O
abashed O
, O
and O
cast O
down O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
. O
What O
recollections O
of O
boyhood O
and O
innocence O
might O
have O
been O
flitting O
across O
his O
brain O
? O
What O
pangs O
of O
dim O
remorse O
and O
doubt O
and O
shame O
? O
“ O
Your O
sisters O
must O
be O
young O
women O
now O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
thinking O
of O
those O
girls O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
perhaps O
since O
she O
had O
left O
them O
. O
“ O
Don’t O
know O
, O
I’m O
shaw O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
Colonel O
. O
“ O
Hullo S-PERSON
! O
here’s O
old O
Mother B-PERSON

you O

Master B-PERSON
Rawdon E-PERSON

? O
Dammy S-PERSON
how O
those O
old O
women O
last O

she O
was O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
when O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
. O
” O
They O
were O
going O
through O
the O
lodge O
- O
gates O
kept O
by O
old O
Mrs. O
Lock S-PERSON
, O
whose O
hand O
Rebecca S-PERSON
insisted O
upon O
shaking O
, O
as O
she O
flung O
open O
the O
creaking O
old O
iron O
gate O
, O
and O
the O
carriage O
passed O
between O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
moss O
- O
grown O
pillars O
surmounted O
by O
the O
dove O
and O
serpent O
. O
“ O
The O
governor O
has O
cut O
into O
the O
timber O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
, O
looking O
about O
, O
and O
then O
was O
silent O
— O
so O
was O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
Both O
of O
them O
were O
rather O
agitated O
, O
and O
thinking O
of O
old O
times O
. O
He O
about O
Eton S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
mother O
, O
whom O
he O
remembered O
, O
a O
frigid O
demure O
woman O
, O
and O
a O
sister O
who O
died O
, O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
passionately O
fond O
| | O
and O
how O
he O
used O
to O
thrash O
Pitt S-PERSON
| | O
and O
about O
little O
Rawdy S-PERSON
at O
home O
. O
And O
Rebecca S-PERSON
thought O
about O
her O
own O
youth O
, O
and O
the O
dark O
secrets O
of O
those B-DATE
early I-DATE
tainted I-DATE
days E-DATE
| | O
and O
of O
her O
entrance O
into O
life O
by O
yonder O
gates O
| | O
and O
of O
Miss O
Pinkerton S-PERSON
, O
and O
Joe S-PERSON
, O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
The O
gravel O
walk O
and O
terrace O
had O
been O
scraped O
quite O
clean O
. O
A O
grand O
painted O
hatchment O
was O
already O
over O
the O
great O
entrance O
, O
and O
two S-CARDINAL
very O
solemn O
and O
tall O
personages O
in O
black O
flung O
open O
each O
a O
leaf O
of O
the O
door O
as O
the O
carriage O
pulled O
up O
at O
the O
familiar O
steps O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
turned O
red O
, O
and O
Becky S-PERSON
somewhat O
pale O
, O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
the O
old O
hall O
, O
arm O
in O
arm O
. O
She O
pinched O
her O
husband’s O
arm O
as O
they O
entered O
the O
oak O
parlour O
, O
where O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
ready O
to O
receive O
them O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
in O
black O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
in O
black O
, O
and O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
with O
a O
large O
black O
head O
piece O
of O
bugles O
and O
feathers O
, O
which O
waved O
on O
her O
Ladyship’s O
head O
like O
an O
undertaker’s O
tray O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
had O
judged O
correctly O
, O
that O
she O
would O
not O
quit O
the O
premises O
. O
She O
contented O
herself O
by O
preserving O
a O
solemn O
and O
stony O
silence O
, O
when O
in O
company O
of O
Pitt S-PERSON
and O
his O
rebellious O
wife O
, O
and O
by O
frightening O
the O
children O
in O
the O
nursery O
by O
the O
ghastly O
gloom O
of O
her O
demeanour O
. O
Only O
a O
very O
faint O
bending O
of O
the O
head O
- O
dress O
and O
plumes O
welcomed O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
, O
as O
those O
prodigals O
returned O
to O
their O
family O
. O
To O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
they O
were O
not O
affected O
very O
much O
one S-CARDINAL
way O
or O
other O
by O
this O
coolness O
. O
Her O
Ladyship O
was O
a O
person O
only O
of O
secondary O
consideration O
in O
their O
minds O
just O
then O
— O
they O
were O
intent O
upon O
the O
reception O
which O
the O
reigning O
brother O
and O
sister O
would O
afford O
them O
. O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
with O
rather O
a O
heightened O
colour O
, O
went O
up O
and O
shook O
his O
brother O
by O
the O
hand O
| | O
and O
saluted O
Rebecca S-PERSON
with O
a O
handshake O
and O
a O
very O
low O
bow O
. O
But O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
took O
both O
the O
hands O
of O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
kissed O
her O
affectionately O
. O
The O
embrace O
somehow O
brought O
tears O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
little O
adventuress O
— O
which O
ornaments O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
she O
wore O
very O
seldom O
. O
The O
artless O
mark O
of O
kindness O
and O
confidence O
touched O
and O
pleased O
her O
| | O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
encouraged O
by O
this O
demonstration O
on O
his O
sister’s O
part O
, O
twirled O
up O
his O
mustachios O
, O
and O
took O
leave O
to O
salute O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
with O
a O
kiss O
, O
which O
caused O
her O
Ladyship O
to O
blush O
exceedingly O
. O
“ O
Dev’lish O
nice O
little O
woman O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
, O
” O
was O
his O
verdict O
, O
when O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
were O
together O
again O
. O
“ O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
got O
fat O
, O
too O
, O
and O
is O
doing O
the O
thing O
handsomely O
. O
” O
“ O
He O
can O
afford O
it O
, O
” O
said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
and O
agreed O
in O
her O
husband’s O
farther O
opinion O
, O
“ O
that O
the O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
a O
tremendous O
old O
Guy S-PERSON
— O
and O
that O
the O
sisters O
were O
rather O
well O
- O
looking O
young O
women O
. O
” O
They O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
summoned O
from O
school O
to O
attend O
the O
funeral O
ceremonies O
. O
It O
seemed O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
house O
and O
family O
, O
had O
thought O
right O
to O
have O
about O
the O
place O
as O
many O
persons O
in O
black O
as O
could O
possibly O
be O
assembled O
. O
All O
the O
men O
and O
maids O
of O
the O
house O
, O
the O
old O
women O
of O
the B-ORG
Alms I-ORG
House E-ORG
, O
whom O
the O
elder O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
had O
cheated O
out O
of O
a O
great O
portion O
of O
their O
due O
, O
the O
Parish B-ORG
Clerk’s E-ORG
family O
, O
and O
the O
special O
retainers O
of O
both O
Hall B-ORG
and I-ORG
Rectory E-ORG
were O
habited O
in O
sable O
| | O
added O
to O
these O
, O
the O
undertaker’s O
men O
, O
at O
least O
a O
score O
, O
with O
crapes O
and O
hat O
- O
bands O
, O
and O
who O
made O
a O
goodly O
show O
when O
the O
great O
burying O
show O
took O
place O
— O
but O
these O
are O
mute O
personages O
in O
our O
drama O
| | O
and O
having O
nothing O
to O
do O
or O
say O
, O
need O
occupy O
a O
very O
little O
space O
here O
. O
With O
regard O
to O
her O
sisters O
- O
in O
- O
law O
Rebecca S-PERSON
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
forget O
her O
former O
position O
of O
Governess O
towards O
them O
, O
but O
recalled O
it O
frankly O
and O
kindly O
, O
and O
asked O
them O
about O
their O
studies O
with O
great O
gravity O
, O
and O
told O
them O
that O
she O
had O
thought O
of O
them O
many O
and O
many O
a O
day O
, O
and O
longed O
to O
know O
of O
their O
welfare O
. O
In O
fact O
you O
would O
have O
supposed O
that O
ever O
since O
she O
had O
left O
them O
she O
had O
not O
ceased O
to O
keep O
them O
uppermost O
in O
her O
thoughts O
, O
and O
to O
take O
the O
tenderest O
interest O
in O
their O
welfare O
. O
So O
supposed O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
herself O
and O
her O
young O
sisters O
. O
“ O
She’s O
hardly O
changed O
since O
eight B-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
” O
said O
Miss O
Rosalind S-PERSON
to O
Miss O
Violet S-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
were O
preparing O
for O
dinner O
. O
“ O
Those O
red- O
haired O
women O
look O
wonderfully O
well O
, O
” O
replied O
the O
other O
. O
“ O
Hers O
is O
much O
darker O
than O
it O
was O
| | O
I O
think O
she O
must O
dye O
it O
, O
” O
Miss O
Rosalind S-PERSON
added O
. O
“ O
She O
is O
stouter O
, O
too O
, O
and O
altogether O
improved O
, O
” O
continued O
Miss O
Rosalind S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
disposed O
to O
be O
very O
fat O
. O
“ O
At O
least O
she O
gives O
herself O
no O
airs O
, O
and O
remembers O
that O
she O
was O
our O
Governess O
once O
, O
” O
Miss O
Violet S-PERSON
said O
, O
intimating O
that O
it O
befitted O
all O
governesses O
to O
keep O
their O
proper O
place O
, O
and O
forgetting O
altogether O
that O
she O
was O
granddaughter O
not O
only O
of O
Sir O
Walpole B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
but O
of O
Mr. O
Dawson B-PERSON
Mudbury E-PERSON
, O
and O
so O
had O
a O
coal O
- O
scuttle O
in O
her O
scutcheon O
. O
There O
are O
other O
very O
well O
- O
meaning O
people O
whom O
one O
meets O
every O
day O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
, O
who O
are O
surely O
equally O
oblivious O
. O
“ O
It O
can’t O
be O
true O
what O
the O
girls O
at O
the O
Rectory O
said O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
was O
an O
opera O
- O
dancer O
— O
” O
“ O
A O
person O
can’t O
help O
their O
birth O
, O
” O
Rosalind S-PERSON
replied O
with O
great O
liberality O
. O
“ O
And O
I O
agree O
with O
our O
brother O
, O
that O
as O
she O
is O
in O
the O
family O
, O
of O
course O
we O
are O
bound O
to O
notice O
her O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
Aunt B-PERSON
Bute E-PERSON
need O
not O
talk O
: O
she O
wants O
to O
marry O
Kate S-PERSON
to O
young O
Hooper S-PERSON
, O
the O
wine O

merchant O

absolutely O
asked O
him O
to O

out O

my O

Becky S-PERSON

close O

intimate O

and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
her O

informed O
Sir O

that O
she O
thought O
her O
new O

in O

law O
was O
a O

affectionate O
young O

so O

easily O
won O
the O
daughter’s O
good O

will O

the O
indefatigable O
little O
woman O
bent O
herself O
to O
conciliate O
the O
august O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
. O
As O
soon O
as O
she O
found O
her O
Ladyship O
alone O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
attacked O
her O
on O
the O
nursery O
question O
at O
once O
, O
and O
said O
that O
her O
own O
little O
boy O
was O
saved O
, O
actually O
saved O
, O
by O
calomel O
, O
freely O
administered O
, O
when O
all O
the O
physicians O
in O
Paris S-GPE
had O
given O
the O
dear O
child O
up O
. O
And O
then O
she O
mentioned O
how O
often O
she O
had O
heard O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
from O
that O
excellent O
man O
the O
Reverend O
Lawrence B-PERSON
Grills E-PERSON
, O
Minister O
of O
the O
chapel O
in O
May B-WORK_OF_ART
Fair E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
she O
frequented O

and O
how O
her O
views O
were O
very O
much O
changed O
by O
circumstances O
and O
misfortunes O
| | O
and O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
a O
past O
life O
spent O
in O
worldliness O
and O
error O
might O
not O
incapacitate O
her O
from O
more O
serious O
thought O
for O
the O
future O
. O
She O
described O
how O
in O
former O
days O
she O
had O
been O
indebted O
to O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
for O
religious O
instruction O
, O
touched O
upon O
the O
“ O
Washerwoman B-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
Finchley I-WORK_OF_ART
Common E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
” O
which O
she O
had O
read O
with O
the O
greatest O
profit O
, O
and O
asked O
about O
Lady B-PERSON
Emily E-PERSON
, O
its O
gifted O
author O
, O
now O
Lady B-PERSON
Emily I-PERSON
Hornblower E-PERSON
, O
at O
Cape B-GPE
Town E-GPE
, O
where O
her O
husband O
had O
strong O
hopes O
of O
becoming O
Bishop O
of O
Caffraria S-GPE
. O
But O
she O
crowned O
all O
, O
and O
confirmed O
herself O
in O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown’s E-PERSON
favour O
, O
by O
feeling O
very O
much O
agitated O
and O
unwell O
after O
the O
funeral O
, O
and O
requesting O
her O
Ladyship’s O
medical O
advice O
, O
which O
the O
Dowager S-PERSON
not O
only O
gave O
, O
but O
, O
wrapped O
up O
in O
a O
bed O
- O
gown O
, O
and O
looking O
more O
like O
Lady B-PERSON
Macbeth E-PERSON
than O
ever O
, O
came O
privately O
in O
the O
night O
to O
Becky’s S-PERSON
room O
, O
with O
a O
parcel O
of O
favourite O
tracts O
, O
and O
a O
medicine O
of O
her O
own O
composition O
, O
which O
she O
insisted O
that O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
should O
take O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
accepted O
the O
tracts O
, O
and O
began O
to O
examine O
them O
with O
great O
interest O
, O
engaging O
the O
Dowager S-PERSON
in O
a O
conversation O
concerning O
them O
and O
the O
welfare O
of O
her O
soul O
, O
by O
which O
means O
she O
hoped O
that O
her O
body O
might O
escape O
medication O
. O
But O
after O
the O
religious O
topics O
were O
exhausted O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Macbeth E-PERSON
would O
not O
quit O
Becky’s S-PERSON
chamber O
until O
her O
cup O
of O
night O
- O
drink O
was O
emptied O
too O
| | O
and O
poor O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
compelled O
actually O
to O
assume O
a O
look O
of O
gratitude O
, O
and O
to O
swallow O
the O
medicine O
under O
the O
unyielding O
old O
Dowager’s S-PERSON
nose O
, O
who O
left O
her O
victim O
finally O
with O
a O
benediction O
. O
It O
did O
not O
much O
comfort O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
| | O
her O
countenance O
was O
very O
queer O
when O
Rawdon S-PERSON
came O
in O
and O
heard O
what O
had O
happened O
| | O
and O
his O
explosions O
of O
laughter O
were O
as O
loud O
as O
usual O
, O
when O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
fun O
which O
she O
could O
not O
disguise O
, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
at O
her O
own O
expense O
, O
described O
the O
occurrence O
, O
and O
how O
she O
had O
been O
victimised O
by O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
. O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
son O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
had O
many O
a O
laugh O
over O
the O
story O
, O
when O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
returned O
to O
their O
quarters O
in O
May B-EVENT
Fair E-EVENT
. O
Becky S-PERSON
acted O
the O
whole O
scene O
for O
them O
. O
She O
put O
on O
a O
night O
- O
cap O
and O
gown O
. O
She O
preached O
a O
great O
sermon O
in O
the O
true O
serious O
manner O
| | O
she O
lectured O
on O
the O
virtue O
of O
the O
medicine O
which O
she O
pretended O
to O
administer O
, O
with O
gravity O
of O
imitation O
so O
perfect O
, O
that O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
Countess’s O
own O
Roman S-NORP
nose O
through O
which O
she O
snuffled O
. O
“ O
Give O
us O
Lady B-WORK_OF_ART
Southdown E-WORK_OF_ART
and O
the O
black O
dose O
, O
” O
was O
a O
constant O
cry O
amongst O
the O
folks O
in O
Becky’s O
little O
drawing O
- O
room O
in O
May B-WORK_OF_ART
Fair E-WORK_OF_ART

And O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
in O
her O
life O
the B-PERSON
Dowager I-PERSON
Countess I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
was O
made O
amusing O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
remembered O
the O
testimonies O
of O
respect O
and O
veneration O
which O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
paid O
personally O
to O
himself O
in O
early B-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
and O
was O
tolerably O
well O
disposed O
towards O
her O
. O
The O
marriage O
, O
ill O
- O
advised O
as O
it O
was O
, O
had O
improved O
Rawdon S-PERSON
very O
much O
— O
that O
was O
clear O
from O
the O
Colonel’s O
altered O
habits O
and O
demeanour O
— O
and O
had O
it O
not O
been O
a O
lucky O
union O
as O
regarded O
Pitt S-PERSON
himself O
? O
The O
cunning O
diplomatist O
smiled O
inwardly O
as O
he O
owned O
that O
he O
owed O
his O
fortune O
to O
it O
, O
and O
acknowledged O
that O
he O
at O
least O
ought O
not O
to O
cry O
out O
against O
it O
. O
His O
satisfaction O
was O
not O
removed O
by O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
own O
statements O
, O
behaviour O
, O
and O
conversation O
. O
She O
doubled O
the O
deference O
which O
before O
had O
charmed O
him O
, O
calling O
out O
his O
conversational O
powers O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
quite O
to O
surprise O
Pitt S-PERSON
himself O
, O
who O
, O
always O
inclined O
to O
respect O
his O
own O
talents O
, O
admired O
them O
the O
more O
when O
Rebecca S-PERSON
pointed O
them O
out O
to O
him O
. O
With O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
satisfactorily O
able O
to O
prove O
, O
that O
it O
was O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
who O
brought O
about O
the O
marriage O
which O
she O
afterwards O
so O
caluminated O
: O
that O
it O
was O
Mrs. O
Bute’s S-PERSON
avarice O
— O
who O
hoped O
to O
gain O
all O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
fortune O
, O
and O
deprive O
Rawdon S-PERSON
of O
his O
aunt’s O
favour O
— O
which O
caused O
and O
invented O
all O
the O
wicked O
reports O
against O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
“ O
She O
succeeded O
in O
making O
us O
poor O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
angelical O
patience O

“ O
but O
how O
can O
I O
be O
angry O
with O
a O
woman O
who O
has O
given O
me O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
best O
husbands O
in O
the O
world O
? O
And O
has O
not O
her O
own O
avarice O
been O
sufficiently O
punished O
by O
the O
ruin O
of O
her O
own O
hopes O

and O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
property O
by O
which O
she O
sat O
so O
much O
store O
? O
Poor O

she O
cried O
. O
“ O
Dear O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
what O
care O
we O
for O
poverty O
? O
I O
am O
used O
to O
it O
from O
childhood O
, O
and O
I O
am O
often O
thankful O
that O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
money O
has O
gone O
to O
restore O
the O
splendour O
of O
the O
noble O
old O
family O
of O
which O
I O
am O
so O
proud O
to O
be O
a O
member O

I O
am O
sure O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
will O
make O
a O
much O
better O
use O
of O
it O
than O
Rawdon S-PERSON
would O
. O
” O
All O
these O
speeches O
were O
reported O
to O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
by O
the O
most O
faithful O
of O
wives O
, O
and O
increased O
the O
favourable O
impression O
which O
Rebecca S-PERSON
made O

so O
much O
so O
, O

that O

she O
forgot O
the O

she O
remembered O
her O

seven B-DATE

contrasted O

for O
so O
it O
was O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
felt O
the O
Vanity O
of O
human O
affairs O
, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
those O
securities O
that O
she O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
cast O
anchor O
. O
It O
may O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
struck O
her O
that O
to O
have O
been O
honest O

humble O
, O
to O

done O
her O
duty O

to O

marched O
straightforward O
on O

would O
have O
brought O
her O
as O
near O
happiness O
as O
that O
path O
by O
which O
she O
was O
striving O
to O
attain O
it O
. O
But O
, O
— O
just O
as O
the O
children O
at O
Queen’s B-FAC
Crawley E-FAC
went O
round O
the O
room O

where O
the O
body O
of O
their O
father O
lay O

— O
if O
ever O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
these O

she O
was O
accustomed O
to O
walk O
round O
them O

not O
look O

She O
eluded O
them O
, O

despised O
them O
— O
or O
at O
least O
she O
was O
committed O
to O
the O
other O
path O
from O
which O
retreat O
was O
now O
impossible O

And O
for O
my O
part O
I O
believe O
that O
remorse O
is O
the O
least O
active O
of O
all O
a O
man’s O
moral O
senses O
— O
the O
very O
easiest O
to O
be O
deadened O
when O
wakened O
: O
and O
in O
some O
never O
wakened O
at O
all O

We O
grieve O
at O
being O
found O
out O
, O
and O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
shame O
or O
punishment O

but O
the O
mere O
sense O
of O
wrong O
makes O
very O
few O
people O
unhappy O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG

So O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
during O
her O
stay O
at O
Queen’s B-FAC
Crawley E-FAC
, O
made O
as O
many O
friends O
of O
the O
Mammon O

Unrighteousness O
as O
she O
could O
possibly O
bring O
under O
control O

Lady O
Jane S-PERSON

her O

bade O
her O
farewell O

the O
warmest O

looked O

Lady B-PERSON
Southdown E-PERSON
made O
her O
up O
a O
packet O

sent O

“ O
honoured O

the O
letter O

yet O
loth O

go O

Queen’s B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
was O
abominably O
stupid O

yet O
the O

purer O

his O

To O
be O
thwarted O

this O
reasonable O

was O
always O
very O
injurious O
to O
the O

doubly O
exasperating O

gout O

age O
, O
loneliness O

the O
force O

to O
weigh O
him O
down O

His O
stiff O

quite O
white O
soon O

his O

infamously O
swindled O
by O
the O
old O

and O
for O
some O
time O
made O
as O

break O
off O

Osborne S-PERSON
withdrew O

of O
a O
certain O
scoundrel O
that O
should O
be O
nameless O

and O
demeaned O
himself O
in O
his O
usual O
violent O
manner O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
condoled O
with O
her O
sister O
Maria S-PERSON
during O
this O
family O
feud O
. O
“ O
I O
always O
told O
you O
, O
Maria S-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
was O
your O
money O
he O
loved O
, O
and O
not O
you O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
soothingly O
. O
‘ O
He O
selected O
me O

replied O
Maria S-PERSON
, O
tossing O
up O
her O
head O
. O
The O
rupture O
was O
, O
however O
, O
only O
temporary O
. O
Fred’s S-PERSON
father O
and O
senior O

counselled O
him O

even O
with O
the O
twenty B-CARDINAL

with O
the O
chances O
of O
the O
further O
division O

So O
he O
“ O
knuckled O
down O

” O
again O

use O
his O

phrase O

sent O

peaceable O
overtures O

It O
was O
his O
father O

he O
said O
, O
who O
would O
not O
hear O

, O
and O
had O
made O
the O

he O
was O
most O
anxious O
to O
keep O
the O
engagement O

sulkily O
accepted O

something O

say O
, O
“ O

pay O
a O

to O
their O

Miss O

I O
believe O
it O
was O

consequence O

that O
it O
is O
a O
wonder O
how O
any O
man O
of O
feeling O
could O
have O
resisted O
the O
invitation O
. O
She O
was O
never O
tired O
of O
inquiring O
, O
if O
Sorrow S-PERSON
had O
his O
young O
days O
faded O
| | O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
listen O
and O
weep O
like O
Desdemona S-PERSON
at O
the O
stories O
of O
his O
dangers O
and O
campaigns O
. O
It O
has O
been O
said O
that O
our O
honest O
and O
dear O
old O
friend O
used O
to O
perform O
on O
the O
flute O
in O
private O
: O
Glorvina S-PERSON
insisted O
upon O
having O
duets O
with O
him O
, O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
would O
rise O
and O
artlessly O
quit O
the O
room O
, O
when O
the O
young O
couple O
were O
so O
engaged O
. O
Glorvina S-PERSON
forced O
the O
Major O
to O
ride O
with O
her O
of O
mornings O
. O
The O
whole O
cantonment O
saw O
them O
set O
out O
and O
return O
. O
She O
was O
constantly O
writing O
notes O
over O
to O
him O
at O
his O
house O
, O
borrowing O
his O
books O
, O
and O
scoring O
with O
her O
great O
pencil O
- O
marks O
such O
passages O
of O
sentiment O
or O
humour O
as O
awakened O
her O
sympathy O
. O
She O
borrowed O
his O
horses O
, O
his O
servants O
, O
his O
spoons O
, O
and O
palankin O
| | O
— O
no O
wonder O
that O
public O
rumour O
assigned O
her O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Major’s S-NORP
sisters O
in O
England S-GPE
should O
fancy O
they O
were O
about O
to O
have O
a O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
thus O
vigorously O
besieged O
, O
was O
in O
the O
meanwhile O
in O
a O
state O
of O
the O
most O
odious O
tranquillity O
. O
He O
used O
to O
laugh O
when O
the O
young O
fellows O
of O
the O
regiment O
joked O
him O
about O
Glorvina’s S-PERSON
manifest O
attentions O
to O
him O
. O
“ O
Bah S-PERSON
! O
” O
said O
he O
, O
“ O
she O
is O
only O
keeping O
her O
hand O
in O
— O
she O
practises O
upon O
me O
as O
she O
does O
upon O
Mrs. O
Tozer’s S-PERSON
piano O
, O
because O
it’s O
the O
most O
handy O
instrument O
in O
the O
station O
. O
I O
am O
much O
too O
battered O
and O
old O
for O
such O
a O
fine O
young O
lady O
as O
Glorvina S-PERSON
. O
” O
And O
so O
he O
went O
on O
riding O
with O
her O
, O
and O
copying O
music O
and O
verses O
into O
her O
albums O
, O
and O
playing O
at O
chess O
with O
her O
very O
submissively O
| | O
for O
it O
is O
with O
these O
simple O
amusements O
that O
some O
officers O
in O
India S-GPE
are O
accustomed O
to O
while O
away O
their O
leisure O
moments O

while O
others O
of O
a O
less O
domestic O
turn O
hunt O
hogs O
, O
and O
shoot O
snipes O
, O
or O
gamble O
and O
smoke O
cheroots O
, O
and O
betake O
themselves O
to O
brandy O
- O
and O
- O
water O
. O
As O
for O
Sir O
Michael B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
, O
though O
his O
lady O
and O
her O
sister O
both O
urged O
him O
to O
call O
upon O
the O
Major O
to O
explain O
himself O
, O
and O
not O
keep O
on O
torturing O
a O
poor O
innocent O
girl O
in O
that O
shameful O
way O
, O
the O
old O
soldier O
refused O
point O
- O
blank O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
conspiracy O
. O
“ O
Faith O
, O
the O
Major’s S-NORP
big O
enough O
to O
choose O
for O
himself O
, O
” O
Sir O
Michael S-PERSON
said O

“ O
he’ll O
ask O
ye O
when O
he O
wants O
ye O
| | O
” O
— O
or O
else O
he O
would O
turn O
the O
matter O
off O
jocularly O
, O
declaring O
that O
“ O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
too O
young O
to O
keep O
house O
, O
and O
had O
written O
home O
to O
ask O
lave O
of O
his O
mamma O
. O
” O
Nay S-PERSON
, O
he O
went O
farther O
, O
and O
in O
private O
communications O
with O
his O
Major O
, O
would O
caution O
and O
rally O
him O
— O
crying O
, O
“ O
Mind O
your O
oi O
, O
Dob O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
them O
girls O
is O
bent O
on O
mischief O
— O
me O
Lady S-PERSON
has O
just O
got O
a O
box O
of O
gowns O
from O
Europe S-LOC
, O
and O
there’s O
a O
pink O
satin O
for O
Glorvina O
, O
which O
will O
finish O
ye O
, O
Dob O

if O
it’s O
in O
the O
power O
of O
woman O
or O
satin O
to O
move O
ye O
. O
” O
But O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
neither O
beauty O
nor O
fashion O
could O
conquer O
him O
. O
Our O
honest O
friend O
had O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
idea O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
his O
head O
, O
and O
that O
one O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
resemble O
Miss O
Glorvina B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
in O
pink O
satin O
. O
A O
gentle O
little O
woman O
in O
black O
, O
with O
large O
eyes O
and O
brown O
hair O
, O
seldom O
speaking O
save O
when O
spoken O
to O
, O
and O
then O
in O
a O
voice O
not O
the O
least O
resembling O
Miss O
Glorvina’s S-PERSON
— O
a O
soft O
young O
mother O
tending O
an O
infant O
and O
beckoning O
the O
Major O
up O
with O
a O
smile O
to O
look O
at O
him O
— O
a O
rosy O
- O
cheeked O
lass O
coming O
singing O
into O
the O
room O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
or O
hanging O
on O
George B-PERSON
Osborne’s E-PERSON
arm O
, O
happy O
and O
loving O
— O
there O
was O
but O
this O
image O
that O
filled O
our O
honest O
Major’s S-PERSON
mind O
by O
day O
and O
by O
night O
, O
and O
reigned O
over O
it O
always O
. O
Very O
likely O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
not O
like O
the O
portrait O
the O
Major O
had O
formed O
of O
her O
: O
there O
was O
a O
figure O
in O
a O
book O
of O
fashions O
which O
his O
sisters O
had O
in O
England S-GPE
, O
and O
with O
which O
William S-PERSON
had O
made O
away O
privately O
, O
pasting O
it O
into O
the O
lid O
of O
his O
desk O
, O
and O
fancying O
he O
saw O
some O
resemblance O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
in O
the O
print O
, O
whereas O
I O
have O
seen O
it O
, O
and O
can O
vouch O
that O
it O
is O
but O
the O
picture O
of O
a O
high O
- O
waisted O
gown O
with O
an O
impossible O
doll’s O
face O
simpering O
over O
it O
— O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
Mr. O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
sentimental O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
no O
more O
like O
the O
real O
one O
than O
this O
absurd O
little O
print O
which O
he O
cherished O
. O
But O
what O
man O
in O
love O
, O
of O
us O
, O
is O
better O
informed O
? O
— O
or O
is O
he O
much O
happier O
when O
he O
sees O
and O
owns O
his O
delusion O
? O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
under O
this O
spell O
. O
He O
did O
not O
bother O
his O
friends O
and O
the O
public O
much O
about O
his O
feelings O
, O
or O
indeed O
lose O
his O
natural O
rest O
or O
appetite O
on O
account O
of O
them O
. O
His O
head O
has O
grizzled O
since O
we O
saw O
him O
last O

and O
a O
line O
or O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
silver O
may O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
soft O
brown O
hair O
likewise O
. O
But O
his O
feelings O
are O
not O
in O
the O
least O
changed O
or O
oldened O

and O
his O
love O
remains O
as O
fresh O
as O
a O
man’s O
recollections O
of O
boyhood O
are O
. O
We O
have O
said O
how O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
Misses B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON

Amelia S-PERSON
, O
the O
Major’s S-NORP
correspondents O

out O

” O
The O
native O
servants O
lying O
outside O
his O
verandahs O
beheld O
with O
wonder O
the O
Major O
, O
so O
cold O
and O
quiet O
ordinarily O
, O
at O
present O
so O
passionately O
moved O
and O
cast O
down O

Would O
she O
have O
pitied O
him O
had O
she O
seen O
him O
? O
He O
read O
over O
and O
over O
all O
the O
letters O
which O
he O
ever O
had O
from O
her O
— O
letters O
of O
business O
relative O
to O
the O
little O
property O
which O
he O
had O
made O
her O
believe O
her O
husband O
had O
left O
to O
her O
— O
brief O
notes O
of O
invitation O
— O
every O
scrap O
of O
writing O
that O
she O
had O
ever O
sent O
to O
him O
— O
how O
cold O
, O
how O
kind O
, O
how O
hopeless O
, O
how O
selfish O
they O
were O
! O
Had O
there O
been O
some O
kind O
gentle O
soul O
near O
at O
hand O
who O
could O
read O
and O
appreciate O
this O
silent O
generous O
heart O
, O
who O
knows O
but O
that O
the O
reign O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
might O
have O
been O
over O
, O
and O
that O
friend O
William’s S-PERSON
love O
might O
have O
flowed O
into O
a O
kinder O
channel O
? O
But O
there O
was O
only O
Glorvina S-PERSON
of O
the O
jetty O
ringlets O
with O
whom O
his O
intercourse O
was O
familiar O
, O
and O
this O
dashing O
young O
woman O
was O
not O
bent O
upon O
loving O
the O
Major O
, O
but O
rather O
on O
making O
the O
Major O
admire O
her O
— O
a O
most O
vain O
and O
hopeless O
task O
, O
too O
, O
at O
least O
considering O
the O
means O
that O
the O
poor O
girl O
possessed O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
. O
She O
curled O
her O
hair O
and O
showed O
her O
shoulders O
at O
him O
, O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
did O
ye O
ever O
see O
such O
jet O
ringlets O
and O
such O
a O
complexion O
? O
She O
grinned O
at O
him O
so O
that O
he O
might O
see O
that O
every O
tooth O
in O
her O
head O
was O
sound O
— O
and O
he O
never O
heeded O
all O
these O
charms O
. O
Very O
soon O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
box O
of O
millinery O
, O
and O
perhaps O
indeed O
in O
honour O
of O
it O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
and O
the O
ladies O
of O
the B-ORG
King’s I-ORG
Regiment E-ORG
gave O
a O
ball O
to O
the B-ORG
Company’s I-ORG
Regiments E-ORG
and O
the O
civilians O
at O
the O
station O
. O
Glorvina S-PERSON
sported O
the O
killing O
pink O
frock O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
, O
who O
attended O
the O
party O
and O
walked O
very O
ruefully O
up O
and O
down O
the O
rooms O
, O
never O
so O
much O
as O
perceived O
the O
pink O
garment O
. O
Glorvina S-PERSON
danced O
past O
him O
in O
a O
fury O
with O
all O
the O
young O
subalterns O
of O
the O
station O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
jealous O
of O
her O
performance O
, O
or O
angry O
because O
Captain B-PERSON
Bangles E-PERSON
of O
the O
Cavalry S-ORG
handed O
her O
to O
supper O
. O
It O
was O
not O
jealousy O
, O
or O
frocks O
or O
shoulders O
, O
that O
could O
move O
him O
, O
and O
Glorvina S-PERSON
had O
nothing O
more O
. O
So O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
were O
each O
exemplifying O
the O
Vanity O
of O
this O
life O
, O
and O
each O
longing O
for O
what O
he O
or O
she O
could O
not O
get O
. O
Glorvina S-PERSON
cried O
with O
rage O
at O
the O
failure O
. O
She O
had O
set O
her O
mind O
on O
the O
Major O
“ O
more O
than O
on O
any O
of O
the O
others O
, O
” O
she O
owned O
, O
sobbing O
. O
“ O
He’ll O
break O
my O
heart O
, O
he O
will O
, O
Peggy S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
would O
whimper O
to O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
when O
they O
were O
good O
friends O

“ O
sure O
every O
one O
of O
me O
frocks O
must O
be O
taken O

Fat O

laughing O
or O
melancholy O
, O
on O
horseback O
or O
the O
music O

stool O
, O
it O
was O
all O
the O
same O
to O
the O
Major O
. O
And O
the O
Colonel O
, O
puffing O
his O
pipe O
and O
listening O
to O
these O
complaints O
, O
would O
suggest O
that O
Glory S-PERSON
should O
have O
some O
black O
frocks O
out O
in O
the O
next O
box O
from O
London S-GPE
, O
and O
told O
a O
mysterious O
story O
of O
a O
lady O
in O
Ireland S-GPE
who O
died O
of O
grief O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
her O
husband O
before O
she O
got O
ere O
a O
one O
. O
While O
the O
Major O
was O
going O
on O
in O
this O
tantalizing O
way O
, O
not O
proposing O
, O
and O
declining O
to O
fall O
in O
love O
, O
there O
came O
another O
ship O
from O
Europe S-LOC
bringing O
letters O
on O
board O
, O
and O
amongst O
them O
some O
more O
for O
the O
heartless O
man O
. O
These O
were O
home O
letters O
bearing O
an O
earlier O
post O
- O
mark O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former O
packets O
, O
and O
as O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
recognised O
among O
his O
the O
handwriting O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
who O
always O
crossed O
and O
recrossed O
her O
letters O
to O
her O
brother O
, O
— O
gathered O
together O
all O
the O
possible O
bad O
news O
which O
she O
could O
collect O
, O
abused O
him O
and O
read O
him O
lectures O
with O
sisterly O
frankness O
, O
and O
always O
left O
him O
miserable O
for O
the O
day O
after O
“ O
dearest O
William S-PERSON
” O
had O
achieved O
the O
perusal O
of O
one O
of O
her O
epistles O
— O
the O
truth O
must O
be O
told O
that O
dearest O
William S-PERSON

not O
hurry O
himself O
to O
break O
the O
seal O

Miss O

waited O
for O

favourable O
day O

mood O
for O

so O

A O
fortnight O

undeceiving O
her O

assuring O

pretty O
cheerfully O
at O
Lady B-FAC

where O
Glorvina S-PERSON
thought O
that O

she O
favoured O
him O

the O
truth O
is O
, O
he O
was O
no O
more O
listening O
to O

to O
the O
howling O
of O

took O

up O

this O

itself O
a O

gaudy O

all O

more O

The O

they O
appeared O

cheerful O

blushing O
face O
streaked O
with O
white O
: O
the O
old O
bronze O
lions O

Sir O

. O
A O
little O
woman O
, O
with O

was O
perpetually O

an O
elderly O
spinster O
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
little O
boy O
, O
also O
might O
be O
remarked O
coming O
thither O
daily O
. O
It O
was O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
and O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
whose O
business O
it O
was O
to O
see O
to O
the O
inward O
renovation O
of O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
house O
, O
to O

rummage O
in O
the O
drawers O

cupboards O
crammed O
with O
the O
dirty O
relics O

congregated O

of O
generations O

Mrs. O

general O

chief O
over O
these O
arrangements O
, O
with O
full O
orders O
from O

to O
sell O
, O
barter O
, O
confiscate O
, O

purchase O
furniture O

and O
she O
enjoyed O
herself O
not O
a O
little O
in O
an O
occupation O
which O
gave O
full O
scope O
to O
her O
taste O
and O
ingenuity O
. O
The O
renovation O
of O
the O
house O
was O
determined O
upon O
when O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
came O
to O
town O
in O
November S-DATE
to O
see O
his O
lawyers O
, O

when O
he O
passed O
nearly B-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
in O
Curzon B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
under O
the O
roof O
of O
his O
affectionate O
brother O

sister O
. O
He O
had O
put O
up O
at O
an O
hotel O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
| | O
but O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
heard O
of O
the O
Baronet’s S-PERSON
arrival O
, O
went O
off O
alone O
to O
greet O
him O
, O
and O
returned O
in O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
to O
Curzon B-FAC
Street E-FAC
with O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
in O
the O
carriage O
by O
her O
side O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
sometimes O
to O
resist O
this O
artless O
little O
creature’s O
hospitalities O
, O
so O
kindly O
were O
they O
pressed O
, O
so O
frankly O
and O
amiably O
offered O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
seized O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
hand O
in O
a O
transport O
of O
gratitude O
when O
he O
agreed O
to O
come O
. O
“ O
Thank O
you O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
squeezing O
it O
, O
and O
looking O
into O
the O
Baronet’s S-PERSON
eyes O
, O
who O
blushed O
a O
good O
deal O
| | O
“ O
how O
happy O
this O
will O
make O
Rawdon S-PERSON
! O
” O
She O
bustled O
up O
to O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
bedroom O
, O
leading O
on O
the O
servants O
, O
who O
were O
carrying O
his O
trunks O
thither O
. O
She O
came O
in O
herself O
laughing O
, O
with O
a O
coal O
- O
scuttle O
out O
of O
her O
own O
room O
. O
A O
fire O
was O
blazing O
already O
in O
Sir B-FAC
Pitt’s E-FAC
apartment O
( O
it O
was O
Miss B-LOC
Briggs’s E-LOC
room O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
who O
was O
sent O
upstairs O
to O
sleep O
with O
the O
maid O
) O
. O
“ O
I O
knew O
I O
should O
bring O
you O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
with O
pleasure O
beaming O
in O
her O
glance O
. O
Indeed O
, O
she O
was O
really O
sincerely O
happy O
at O
having O
him O
for O
a O
guest O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
made O
Rawdon S-PERSON
dine O
out O
once O
or O
twice O
on O
business O
, O
while O
Pitt S-PERSON
stayed O
with O
them O
, O
and O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
passed O
the O
happy O
evening O
alone O
with O
her O
and O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
She O
went O
downstairs O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
actually O
cooked O
little O
dishes O
for O
him O
. O
“ O
Isn’t O
it O
a O
good O
salmi O
? O
” O
she O
said O
| | O
“ O
I O
made O
it O
for O
you O
. O
I O
can O
make O
you O
better O
dishes O
than O
that O
: O
and O
will O
when O
you O
come O
to O
see O
me O
. O
” O
“ O
Everything O
you O
do O
, O
you O
do O
well O
, O
” O
said O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
, O
gallantly O
. O
“ O
The O
salmi O
is O
excellent O
indeed O
. O
” O
“ O
A O
poor O
man’s O
wife O
, O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
replied O
, O
gaily O
, O
“ O
must O
make O
herself O
useful O
, O
you O
know O
: O
” O
on O
which O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
vowed O
that O
“ O
she O
was O
fit O
to O
be O
the O
wife O
of O
an O
Emperor O
, O
and O
that O
to O
be O
skillful O
in O
domestic O
duties O
was O
surely O
one O
of O
the O
most O
charming O
of O
woman’s O
qualities O
. O
” O
And O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
thought O
, O
with O
something O
like O
mortification O
, O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
at O
home O
, O
and O
of O
a O
certain O
pie O
which O
she O
had O
insisted O
on O
making O
, O
and O
serving O
to O
him O
at O
dinner O
— O
a O
most O
abominable O
pie O
. O
Besides O
the O
salmi O
, O
which O
was O
made O
of O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
pheasants O
from O
his O
lordship’s O
cottage O
of O
Stillbrook S-GPE
, O
Becky S-PERSON
gave O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
a O
bottle O
of O
white O
wine O
, O
some O
that O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
brought O
with O
him O
from O
France S-GPE
, O
and O
had O
picked O
up O
for O
nothing O
, O
the O
little O
story O
- O
teller O
said O
| | O
whereas O
the O
liquor O
was O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
some O
White O
Hermitage O
from O
the O
Marquis O
of O
Steyne’s O
famous O
cellars O
, O
which O
brought O
fire O
into O
the O
Baronet’s S-NORP
pallid O
cheeks O
and O
a O
glow O
into O
his O
feeble O
frame O
. O
Then O
when O
he O
had O
drunk O
up O
the O
bottle O
of O
petit O
vin O
blanc O
, O
she O
gave O
him O
her O
hand O
and O
took O
him O
up O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
made O
him O
snug O
on O
the O
sofa O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
let O
him O
talk O
as O
she O
listened O
with O
the O
tenderest O
kindly O
interest O
, O
sitting O
by O
him O
, O
and O
hemming O
a O
shirt O
for O
her O
dear O
little O
boy O
. O
Whenever O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
wished O
to O
be O
particularly O
humble O
and O
virtuous O
, O
this O
little O
shirt O
used O
to O
come O
out O
of O
her O
work O
- O
box O
. O
It O
had O
got O
to O
be O
too O
small O
for O
Rawdon S-PERSON
long O
before O
it O
was O
finished O
. O
Well O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
listened O
to O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
she O
talked O
to O
him O
, O
she O
sang O
to O
him O
, O
she O
coaxed O
him O
, O
and O
cuddled O
him O
, O
so O
that O
he O
found O
himself O
more O
and O
more O
glad O
every O
day O
to O
get O
back O
from O
the O
lawyer’s O
at O
Gray’s B-FAC
Inn E-FAC
, O
to O
the O
blazing O
fire O
in O
Curzon B-FAC
Street E-FAC
— O
a O
gladness O
in O
which O
the O
men O
of O
law O
likewise O
participated O
, O
for O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
harangues O
were O
of O
the O
longest O
— O
and O
so O
that O
when O
he O
went O
away O
he O
felt O
quite O
a O
pang O
at O
departing O
. O
How O
pretty O
she O
looked O
kissing O
her O
hand O
to O
him O
from O
the O
carriage O
and O
waving O
her O
handkerchief O
when O
he O
had O
taken O
his O
place O
in O
the O
mail O
! O
She O
put O
the O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
once O
. O
He O
pulled O
his O
sealskin O
cap O
over O
his O
, O
as O
the O
coach O
drove O
away O
, O
and O
, O
sinking O
back O
, O
he O
thought O
to O
himself O
how O
she O
respected O
him O
and O
how O
he O
deserved O
it O
, O
and O
how O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
a O
foolish O
dull O
fellow O
who O
didn’t O
half O
appreciate O
his O
wife O
: O
and O
how O
mum O
and O
stupid O
his O
own O
wife O
was O
compared O
to O
that O
brilliant O
little O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
hinted O
every O
one O
of O
these O
things O
herself O
, O
perhaps O
, O
but O
so O
delicately O
and O
gently O
, O
that O
you O
hardly O
knew O
when O
or O
where O
. O
And O
, O
before O
they O
parted O
, O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
the O
house O
in O
London S-GPE
should O
be O
redecorated O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
season E-DATE
, O
and O
that O
the O
brothers’ O
families O
should O
meet O
again O
in O
the O
country O
at O
Christmas S-DATE
. O
“ O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
have O
got O
a O
little O
money O
out O
of O
him O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
wife O
moodily O
when O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
was O
gone O
. O
“ O
I O
should O
like O
to O
give O
something O
to O
old O
Raggles S-PERSON
hanged O
if O
I O
shouldn’t O
. O
It O
ain’t O
right O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
the O
old O
fellow O
should O
be O
kept O
out O
of O
all O
his O
money O
. O
It O
may O
be O
inconvenient O
, O
and O
he O
might O
let O
to O
somebody O
else O
besides O
us O
, O
you O
know O
. O
” O
“ O
Tell O
him O
, O
” O
said O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
“ O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
affairs O
are O
settled O
, O
everybody O
will O
be O
paid O
, O
and O
give O
him O
a O
little O
something O
on O
account O
. O
Here’s O
a O
cheque O
that O
Pitt S-PERSON
left O
for O
the O
boy O
, O
” O
and O
she O
took O
from O
her O
bag O
and O
gave O
her O
husband O
a O
paper O
which O
his O
brother O
had O
handed O
over O
to O
her O
, O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
little O
son O
and O
heir O
of O
the O
younger O
branch O
of O
the O
Crawleys S-ORG

The O
truth O
is O
, O
she O
had O
tried O
personally O
the O
ground O
on O
which O
her O
husband O
expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
she O
should O
venture O
— O
tried O
it O
ever O
so O
delicately O
, O
and O
found O
it O
unsafe O
. O
Even O
at O
a O
hint O
about O
embarrassments O
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
was O
off O
and O
alarmed O
. O
And O
he O
began O
a O
long O
speech O
, O
explaining O
how O
straitened O
he O
himself O
was O
in O
money O

such O

that O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON

nothing O

He O
knew O

appropriator O
of O
the O

which O
, O
according O
to O

ought O

have O
fallen O

his O

he O
had O
, O
we O
may O
be O
sure O
, O
some O
secret O
pangs O
of O
remorse O
within O
him O

warned O
him O

knew O
his O

did O
his O
duty O
outwardly O

There O

So O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
thought O
he O
would O
do O
something O
for O
his O

and O
then O
thought O
that O
he O
would O
think O
about O
it O
some O
other O
time O
. O
And O
with O
regard O
to O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
not O
a O
woman O
who O
expected O
too O
much O
from O
the O
generosity O
of O
her O
neighbours O
and O
so O
was O
quite O
content O
with O
all O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
had O
done O
for O
her O
. O
She O
was O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
family O
. O
If O
Pitt S-PERSON
would O
not O
give O
her O
anything O
, O
he O
would O
get O
something O
for O
her O
some O
day O
. O
If O
she O
got O
no O
money O
from O
her O
brother O

in O

she O
got O
what O
was O
as O
good O
as O
money O
— O
credit O
. O
Raggles S-PERSON
was O
made O
rather O
easy O
in O
his O
mind O
by O
the O
spectacle O
of O
the O
union O
between O
the O
brothers O
, O
by O
a O
small O
payment O
on O
the O
spot O

and O
by O
the O
promise O
of O
a O
much O
larger O
sum O
speedily O
to O
be O
assigned O
to O
him O
. O
And O
Rebecca S-PERSON
told O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
whose O
Christmas S-DATE
dividend O
upon O
the O
little O
sum O
lent O
by O
her O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
paid O
with O
an O
air O
of O
candid O
joy O
, O
and O
as O
if O
her O
exchequer O
was O
brimming O
over O
with O
gold O
— O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
we O
say O
, O
told O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
in O
strict O
confidence O
, O
that O
she O
had O
conferred O
with O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON

who O
was O
famous O
as O
a O
financier O
, O
on O
Briggs’s S-ORG
special O

, O
as O
to O
the O
most O
profitable O
investment O
of O
Miss O
B.’s O
remaining O
capital O

that O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
after O
much O
consideration O
, O
had O
thought O
of O
a O
most O
safe O
and O
advantageous O
way O
in O
which O
Briggs S-PERSON
could O
lay O
out O
her O
money O

that O
, O
being O
especially O
interested O
in O
her O
as O
an O
attached O
friend O
of O
the O
late O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
the O
whole O
family O
, O
and O
that O
long O
before O
he O
left O
town O
, O
he O
had O
recommended O
that O
she O
should O
be O
ready O
with O
the O
money O
at O
a O
moment’s O
notice O
, O
so O
as O
to O
purchase O
at O
the O
most O
favourable O
opportunity O
the O
shares O
which O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
had O
in O
his O
eye O
. O
Poor O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
very O
grateful O
for O
this O
mark O
of O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
attention O
— O
it O
came O
so O
unsolicited O
, O
she O
said O
, O
for O
she O
never O
should O
have O
thought O
of O
removing O
the O
money O
from O
the O
funds O
— O
and O
the O
delicacy O
enhanced O
the O
kindness O
of O
the O
office O
| | O
and O
she O
promised O
to O
see O
her O
man O
of O
business O
immediately O
, O
and O
be O
ready O
with O
her O
little O
cash O
at O
the B-TIME
proper I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
And O
this O
worthy O
woman O
was O
so O
grateful O
for O
the O
kindness O
of O
Rebecca S-PERSON
in O
the O
matter O
, O
and O
for O
that O
of O
her O
generous O
benefactor O
, O
the O
Colonel O
, O
that O
she O
went O
out O
and O
spent O
a O
great O
part O
of O
her O
year’s O
dividend O
in O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O
black O
velvet O
coat O
for O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON

by O
the O
way O

was O
grown O
almost O
too O
big O
for O
black O
velvet O
now O
, O
and O
was O
of O
a O
size O
and O
age O
befitting O
him O
for O
the O
assumption O
of O
the O
virile O
jacket O

pantaloons O

He O
was O

with O
blue O

waving O

down O

his O

His O

out O

struck O
him O
violently O
a O

heard O
a O

up O

His O
very O
sight O
annoyed O
her O
. O
Fear O
, O
doubt O
, O
and O

up O

too O
, O
in O
the O

They O

Lord O

heartily O
disliked O

When O
they O
met O
by O
mischance O
, O
he O
made O
sarcastic O
bows O

the O

or O
glared O
at O
him O
with O
savage O

eyes O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
used O
to O
stare O
him O
in O
the O

, O
and O
double O
his O
little O

in O

this O

One S-CARDINAL

The O

“ O
Was O

guilty O

not O

” O
the O
Vehmgericht S-PERSON
of O
the O
servants’ O

had O
pronounced O
against O

And O
, O
I O
shame O
to O

, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
got O
credit O
had O
they O
not O
believed O
her O
to O
be O
guilty O
. O
It O
was O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON

“ O

him O
up O

as O
he O
afterwards O
said O

that O
even O
more O
than O
Rebecca’s S-NORP
arts O

coaxings O
. O
And O
so O
— O
guiltless O
very O
likely O
— O
she O
was O
writhing O

pushing O
onward O
towards O
what O
they O
call O
“ O
a O
position O
in O

” O
and O
the O

pointing O

would O
have O
done O
so O

Jane’s E-PERSON
urgent O
invitations O
to O
the O

the O

“ O
He’s O
the O

the O

in O
a O
tone O
of O
reproach O
to O

“ O

you O
don’t O

as O
you O

He O
shan’t O
bother O
you O
much O
: O
at O

he O
will O
be O
away O
from O
you O
in O
the O

he O
shall O
go O
outside O

me O

” O
“ O
where O
you O
go O
yourself O

you O

” O
replied O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
remember O
when O
you O
liked O
’em O
though O
, O
” O
answered O
the O
husband O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
laughed O
: O
she O
was O
almost O
always O
good O

That O
was O
when O
I O
was O
on O
my O

she O

“ O

you O

give O
him O
a O
cigar O

” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
did O
not O
warm O
his O
little O

for O
the O
winter’s O
journey O
in O
this O
way O

he O

Briggs S-PERSON
wrapped O
up O
the O

and O
with O
no O
small O

he O
watched O
the O

made O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
journey O
to O
the O
place O

his O

still O
called O

It O
was O
a O
journey O

infinite O
pleasure O
to O
the O

to O
whom O
the O
incidents O

endless O

his O

him O
all O

he O
sate O

looked O
out O

iron O
gates O
flew O
open O

at O
the O
white O

of O
his O

Rawdon S-PERSON
the O

Sir O

read O
prayers O

It O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL

the O
poor O
little O
boy O
had O
ever O
witnessed O

heard O

The O

been O
much O
improved O
even O
since O
the O
Baronet’s S-PERSON
brief O
reign O

was O
pronounced O
by O
Becky S-PERSON
to O
be O
perfect O
, O
charming O
, O
delightful O
, O
when O
she O
surveyed O
it O
in O
his O
company O
. O
As O
for O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
who O
examined O
it O
with O
the O
children O
for O
his O
guides O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O
perfect O
palace O
of O
enchantment O
and O
wonder O
. O
There O
were O
long O
galleries O
, O
and O
ancient O
state O
bed- O
rooms O
, O
there O
were O
pictures O

old O

There O
were O
the O
rooms O
in O
which O
grandpapa O
died O

and O
by O
which O
the O
children O
walked O
with O
terrified O
looks O
. O
“ O
Who O
was O
grandpapa O
? O
” O
he O
asked O

and O
they O
told O
him O
how O
he O
used O
to O
be O
very O
old O
, O
and O
used O
to O
be O
wheeled O
about O

they O
showed O
him O
the O

one O
day O
rotting O

the O
out O

house O

it O
had O
lain O

the O
old O

wheeled O
away O
yonder O

the O
church O

of O
which O
the O
spire O
was O
glittering O
over O
the O
park O
elms O
. O
The O
brothers O
had O
good O
occupation O
for O
several B-TIME
mornings E-TIME
in O
examining O
the O
improvements O
which O
had O
been O
effected O
by O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
genius O
and O
economy O
. O
And O
as O
they O
walked O
or O
rode O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
them O
, O
they O
could O
talk O
without O
too O
much O
boring O
each O
other O
. O
And O
Pitt S-PERSON
took O
care O
to O
tell O
Rawdon S-PERSON
what O
a O
heavy O
outlay O
of O
money O
these O
improvements O
had O
occasioned O
: O
and O
that O
a O
man O
of O

funded O
property O
was O
often O
very O
hard O
pressed O
for O
twenty B-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
. O
“ O
There O
is O
that O
new O
lodge O
gate O
, O
” O
said O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
pointing O
to O
it O
humbly O
with O
the O
bamboo O
cane O
, O
“ O
I O
can O
no O
more O
pay O

it O

“ O

can O
lend O
you O
, O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
till O
then O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
answered O
rather O
ruefully O

and O
they O
went O
in O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
restored O

, O
where O
the O
family O
arms O
were O
just O
new O
scraped O

SIR O
PITT B-FAC
CRAWLEY E-FAC
had O
done O
more O

on O
the O
Queen’s B-GPE
Crawley E-GPE

Like O
a O

his O

been O
left O
by O
his O
disreputable O

thriftless O
old O
predecessor O

He O
was O
elected O
for O
the O

speedily O
after O
his O
father’s O
demise O

a O
magistrate O

a O
county O

representative O

ancient O

made O
it O
his O
duty O
to O
show O
himself O
before O
the O
Hampshire S-GPE
public O
, O
subscribed O
handsomely O
to O
the O
county O
charities O
, O
called O
assiduously O
upon O
all O
the O
county O
folk O
, O
and O
laid O
himself O
out O
in O
a O
word O
to O
take O
that O
position O
in O
Hampshire S-GPE
, O
and O
in O
the O
Empire S-LOC
afterwards O
, O
to O
which O
he O
thought O
his O
prodigious O
talents O
justly O
entitled O
him O
. O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
was O
instructed O

frequently O

they O
dined O
pretty O
frequently O
at O
the O

where O
the O
cookery O
was O
so O
good O

that O
it O
was O
clear O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
very O
seldom O
had O
a O
hand O
in O
it O
) O
, O
and O
in O
return O
Pitt S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
most O
energetically O
dined O
out O
in O
all O
sorts O

at O
all O
sorts O
of O
distances O

For O
though O
Pitt S-PERSON
did O
not O
care O
for O
joviality O
, O
being O
a O
frigid O
man O
of O
poor O
health O
and O
appetite O
, O
yet O
he O
considered O
that O
to O
be O
hospitable O
and O
condescending O
was O
quite O
incumbent O
on O
his O
station O
, O
and O
every O
time O
that O
he O
got O
a O
headache O
from O
too O
long O
and O
after O
- O
dinner O
sitting O
, O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
a O
martyr O
to O
duty O
. O
He O
talked O
about O
crops O
, O
corn-laws O
, O
politics O
, O
with O
the O
best O
country O
gentlemen O

He O
( O
who O
had O
been O
formerly O
inclined O
to O
be O
a O
sad O
freethinker O
on O
these O
points O
) O
entered O
into O
poaching O
and O
game O
preserving O
with O
ardour O
. O
He O
didn’t O
hunt O
: O
he O
wasn’t O
a O
hunting O
man O

he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
books O
and O
peaceful O
habits O
: O
but O
he O
thought O
that O
the O
breed O
of O
horses O
must O
be O
kept O
up O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
that O
the O
breed O
of O
foxes O
must O
therefore O
be O
looked O
to O
, O
and O
for O
his O
part O
, O
if O
his O
friend O
, O
Sir O
Huddlestone B-PERSON
Fuddlestone E-PERSON

liked O
to O
draw O
his O
country O

of O
old O
the O
F. O
hounds O
used O
to O
do O
at O

he O
should O
be O
happy O

him O
there O

the O
gentlemen O
of O
the O
Fuddlestone S-PERSON
hunt O
. O
And O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown’s E-PERSON
dismay O
too O
he O
became O
more O
orthodox O
in O
his O
tendencies O
every O
day O
: O
gave O
up O
preaching O
in O
public O

attending O
meeting O

houses O

went O
stoutly O
to O

called O
on O
the O
Bishop O

and O
all O
the O
Clergy O
at O
Winchester S-GPE
: O
and O
made O
no O
objection O
when O
the O
Venerable O
Archdeacon B-PERSON

asked O
for O
a O

penniless O
I O
have O
got O
a O
little O
interest O
— O
and O
who O
knows O
, O
perhaps O
the O
mouse O
may O
be O
able O
to O
aid O
the O
lion O
. O
” O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
was O
amazed O
and O
enraptured O
with O
her O
speech O
. O
“ O
How O
that O
woman O
comprehends O
me O
! O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
never O
could O
get O
Jane S-PERSON
to O
read O
three S-CARDINAL
pages O
of O
the O
malt O

She O
has O
no O
idea O
that O
I O
have O
commanding O
talents O
or O
secret O
ambition O

So O
they O
remember O
my O
speaking O
at O
Oxford S-GPE
, O
do O
they O
? O
The O
rascals O
! O
now O
that O
I O
represent O
my O
borough O

may O
sit O
for O
the O
county O

they O
begin O
to O
recollect O
me O

Why O
, O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
cut O
me O
at O
the O
levee O
last B-DATE
year E-DATE
: O
they O
are O
beginning O
to O
find O
out O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
is O
some O
one O
at O
last O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
man O
was O
always O
the O
same O
whom O
these O
people O
neglected O
: O
it O
was O
only O
the O
opportunity O
that O
was O
wanting O
, O
and O
I O
will O
show O
them O
now O
that O
I O
can O
speak O
and O
act O
as O
well O
as O
write O
. O
Achilles S-PERSON
did O
not O
declare O
himself O
until O
they O
gave O
him O
the O
sword O
. O
I O
hold O
it O
now O
, O
and O
the O
world O
shall O
yet O
hear O
of O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
. O
” O
Therefore O
it O
was O
that O
this O
roguish O
diplomatist O
had O
grown O
so O
hospitable O

that O
he O
was O
so O
civil O
to O
oratorios O

hospitals O

so O
kind O
to O
Deans O

so O
generous O
in O
giving O

accepting O
dinners O

so O
uncommonly O
gracious O
to O
farmers O
on O
market O
- O
days O

and O
so O
much O
interested O
about O
county O
business O

and O
that O
the O
Christmas S-DATE
at O
the O

was O
the O
gayest O
which O
had O
been O
known O
there O
for O
many O

long O
day O

On O
Christmas B-DATE
Day E-DATE
a O
great O
family O
gathering O
took O
place O
. O
All O
the O
Crawleys S-NORP
from O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
came O
to O
dine O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
was O
as O
frank O
and O
fond O
of O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
, O
as O
if O
the O
other O
had O
never O
been O
her O
enemy O

she O
was O
affectionately O
interested O
in O
the O
dear O
girls O

and O
surprised O
at O
the O
progress O
which O
they O
had O
made O
in O
music O
since O
her O
time O
: O
and O
insisted O
upon O
encoring O
one S-CARDINAL

the O
duets O
out O
of O
the O
great O
song O
- O
books O
which O
Jim S-PERSON
, O
grumbling O
, O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
bring O
under O
his O
arm O
from O
the O
Rectory S-FAC
. O
Mrs. O
Bute S-PERSON
, O
perforce O
, O
was O
obliged O
to O
adopt O
a O
decent O
demeanour O
towards O
the O
little O
adventuress O
— O
of O
course O
being O
free O
to O
discourse O
with O
her O
daughters O
afterwards O
about O
the O
absurd O
respect O
with O
which O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
treated O
his O
sister O
- O
in O

law O

But O
Jim S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
sate O
next O
to O
her O
at O
dinner O
, O
declared O
she O
was O
a O
trump O
: O
and O
one O
and O
all O
of O
the O
Rector’s S-PERSON
family O
agreed O
that O
the O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
a O
fine O
boy O
. O
They O
respected O
a O
possible O
baronet O
in O
the O
boy O
, O
between O
whom O
and O
the O
title O
there O
was O
only O
the O
little O
sickly O
pale O
Pitt B-PERSON
Binkie E-PERSON
. O
The O
children O
were O
very O
good O
friends O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON
Binkie E-PERSON
was O
too O
little O
a O
dog O
for O
such O
a O
big O
dog O
as O
Rawdon S-PERSON
to O
play O
with O
: O
and O
Matilda S-PERSON
being O
only O
a O
girl O
, O
of O
course O
not O
fit O
companion O
for O
a O
young O
gentleman O
who O
was O
near O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
old E-DATE
, O
and O
going O
into O
jackets O
very O
soon O
. O
He O
took O
the O
command O
of O
this O
small O
party O
at O
once O
— O
the O
little O
girl O
and O
the O
little O
boy O
following O
him O
about O
with O
great O
reverence O
at O
such O
times O
as O
he O
condescended O
to O
sport O
with O
them O
. O
His O
happiness O
and O
pleasure O
in O
the O
country O
were O
extreme O
. O
The O
kitchen O
garden O
pleased O
him O
hugely O
, O
the O
flowers O
moderately O
, O
but O
the O
pigeons O
and O
the O
poultry O
, O
and O
the O
stables O
when O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
visit O
them O
, O
were O
delightful O
objects O
to O
him O
. O
He O
resisted O
being O
kissed O
by O
the B-PERSON
Misses I-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
: O
but O
he O
allowed O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
sometimes O
to O
embrace O
him O
: O
and O
it O
was O
by O
her O
side O
that O
he O
liked O
to O
sit O
when O
, O
the O
signal O
to O
retire O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
being O
given O
, O
the O
ladies O
left O
the O
gentlemen O
to O
their O
claret O
— O
by O
her O
side O
rather O
than O
by O
his O
mother O
. O
For O
Rebecca S-PERSON
seeing O
that O
tenderness O
was O
the O
fashion O
, O
called O
Rawdon S-PERSON
to O
her O
one O
evening O
, O
and O
stooped O
down O
and O
kissed O
him O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
all O
the O
ladies O
. O
He O
looked O
her O
full O
in O
the O
face O
after O
the O
operation O
, O
trembling O
and O
turning O
very O
red O
, O
as O
his O
wont O
was O
when O
moved O
. O
“ O
You O
never O
kiss O
me O
at O
home O
, O
Mamma S-PERSON
, O
” O
he O
said O

at O
which O
there O
was O
a O
general O
silence O
and O
consternation O
, O
and O
a O
by O
no O
means O
pleasant O
look O
in O
Becky’s S-GPE
eyes O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
fond O
of O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
for O
her O
regard O
for O
his O
son O
. O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
and O
Becky S-PERSON
did O
not O
get O
on O
quite O
so O
well O
at O
this O
visit O
as O
on O
occasion O
of O
the O
former O
one O
, O
when O
the O
Colonel’s S-NORP
wife O
was O
bent O
upon O
pleasing O
. O
Those O
two S-CARDINAL
speeches O
of O
the O
child O
struck O
rather O
a O
chill O
. O
Perhaps O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
rather O
too O
attentive O
to O
her O
. O
But O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
as O
became O
his O
age O
and O
size O
, O
was O
fonder O
of O
the O
society O
of O
the O
men O
than O
of O
the O
women O
| | O
and O
never O
wearied O
of O
accompanying O
his O
sire O
to O
the O
stables O
, O
whither O
the O
Colonel O
retired O
to O
smoke O
his O
cigar O
— O
Jim S-PERSON
, O
the O
Rector’s S-NORP
son O
, O
sometimes O
joining O
his O
cousin O
in O
that O
and O
other O
amusements O
. O
He O
and O
the O
Baronet’s S-NORP
keeper O
were O
very O
close O
friends O
, O
their O
mutual O
taste O
for O
“ O
dawgs O
” O
bringing O
them O
much O
together O

On O
one B-DATE

Mr. O

the O

went O

shot O
pheasants O

taking O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
with O
them O
. O
On O
another B-TIME
most I-TIME
blissful I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
these O
four S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
partook O
of O
the O
amusement O
of O
rat-hunting O
in O
a O
barn O
, O
than O
which O
sport O
Rawdon S-PERSON
as O
yet O
had O
never O
seen O
anything O
more O
noble O
. O
They O
stopped O
up O
the O
ends O
of O
certain O
drains O
in O
the O
barn O
, O
into O
the O
other O
openings O
of O
which O
ferrets O
were O
inserted O

and O
then O
stood O
silently O
aloof O
, O
with O
uplifted O
stakes O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
an O
anxious O
little O

scarcely O
breathing O

listening O
motionless O

the O
faint O

from O
flurry O

excitement O

missed O
his O
rat O

but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
he O
half O
- O
murdered O
a O

the O
greatest O

Sir O

tries O
to O
pay O
off O
his O
debt O

Also O
before O
this B-DATE
merry I-DATE
Christmas E-DATE
was O
over O
, O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
had O
screwed O
up O
courage O
enough O
to O
give O
his O
brother O
another O
draft O

his O
bankers O

for O
no O
less O
a O
sum O

a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY

an O
act O
which O
caused O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
cruel O
pangs O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
but O
which O
made O
him O
glow O
afterwards O
to O
think O
himself O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
generous O
of O
men O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
son O
went O
away O
with O
the O
utmost O
heaviness O
of O
heart O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
and O
the O
ladies O
parted O
with O
some O
alacrity O
, O
however O
: O
and O
our O
friend O
returned O
to O
London S-GPE
to O
commence O
those O
avocations O
with O
which O
we O
find O
her O
occupied O
when O
this O
chapter O
begins O
. O
Under O
her O
care O
the B-FAC
Crawley I-FAC
House E-FAC
in O
Great B-FAC
Gaunt I-FAC
Street E-FAC
was O
quite O
rejuvenescent O
, O
and O
ready O
for O
the O
reception O
of O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
and O
his O
family O
, O
when O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
came O
to O
London S-GPE
to O
attend O
his O
duties O
in O
Parliament S-ORG
, O
and O
to O
assume O
that O
position O
in O
the O
country O
for O
which O
his O
vast O
genius O
fitted O
him O
. O
For O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
session O
, O
this O
profound O
dissembler O
hid O
his O
projects O
and O
never O
opened O
his O
lips O
but O
to O
present O
a O
petition O
from O
Mudbury S-ORG
. O
But O
he O
attended O
assiduously O
in O
his O
place O
, O
and O
learned O
thoroughly O
the O
routine O
and O
business O
of O
the O
House S-ORG
. O
At O
home O
he O
gave O
himself O
up O
to O
the O
perusal O
of O
Blue B-ORG
Books E-ORG
, O
to O
the O
alarm O
and O
wonder O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
, O
who O
thought O
he O
was O
killing O
himself O
by O
late B-TIME
hours E-TIME
and O
intense O
application O
. O
And O
he O
made O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
ministers O
, O
and O
the O
chiefs O
of O
his O
party O
, O
determining O
to O
rank O
as O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
before O
many B-DATE
years E-DATE
were O
over O
. O
Lady O
Jane’s S-PERSON
sweetness O
and O
kindness O
had O
inspired O
Rebecca S-PERSON
with O
such O
a O
contempt O
for O
her O
ladyship O
as O
the O
little O
woman O
found O
no O
small O
difficulty O
in O
concealing O
. O
That O
sort O
of O
goodness O
and O
simplicity O
which O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
possessed O
, O
annoyed O
our O
friend O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
and O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
her O
at O
times O
not O
to O
show O
, O
or O
to O
let O
the O
other O
divine O
her O
scorn O
. O
Her O
presence O
, O
too O
, O
rendered O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
uneasy O
. O
Her O
husband O
talked O
constantly O
with O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
Signs O
of O
intelligence O
seemed O
to O
pass O
between O
them O
: O
and O
Pitt S-PERSON
spoke O
with O
her O
on O
subjects O
on O
which O
he O
never O
thought O
of O
discoursing O
with O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
. O
The O
latter O
did O
not O
understand O
them O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
it O
was O
mortifying O
to O
remain O
silent O
| | O
still O
more O
mortifying O
to O
know O
that O
you O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
and O
hear O
that O
little O
audacious O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
dashing O
on O
from O
subject O
to O
subject O
, O
with O
a O
word O
for O
every O
man O
, O
and O
a O
joke O
always O
pat O
| | O
and O
to O
sit O
in O
one’s O
own O
house O
alone O
, O
by O
the O
fireside O
, O
and O
watching O
all O
the O
men O
round O
your O
rival O
. O
In O
the O
country O
, O
when O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
was O
telling O
stories O
to O
the O
children O
, O
who O
clustered O
about O
her O
knees O
( O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
into O
the O
bargain O
, O
who O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
her O
) O
— O
and O
Becky S-PERSON
came O
into O
the O
room O
, O
sneering O
with O
green O
scornful O
eyes O
, O
poor O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
grew O
silent O
under O
those O
baleful O
glances O
. O
Her O
simple O
little O
fancies O
shrank O
away O
tremulously O
, O
as O
fairies O
in O
the O
story O
- O
books O
, O
before O
a O
superior O
bad O
angel O
. O
She O
could O
not O
go O
on O
, O
although O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
smallest O
inflection O
of O
sarcasm O
in O
her O
voice O
, O
besought O
her O
to O
continue O
that O
charming O
story O
. O
And O
on O
her O
side O
gentle O
thoughts O
and O
simple O
pleasures O
were O
odious O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
| | O
they O
discorded O
with O
her O
| | O
she O
hated O
people O
for O
liking O
them O
| | O
she O
spurned O
children O
and O
children O
- O
lovers O
. O
“ O
I O
have O
no O
taste O
for O
bread O
and O
butter O
, O
” O
she O
would O
say O
, O
when O
caricaturing O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
and O
her O
ways O
to O
my O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
. O
“ O
No O
more O
has O
a O
certain O
person O
for O
holy O
water O
, O
” O
his O
lordship O
replied O
with O
a O
bow O
and O
a O
grin O
, O
and O
a O
great O
jarring O
laugh O
afterwards O
. O
So O
these O
two S-CARDINAL
ladies O
did O
not O
see O
much O
of O
each O
other O
except O
upon O
those O
occasions O
, O
when O
the O
younger O
brother’s O
wife O
, O
having O
an O
object O
to O
gain O
from O
the O
other O
, O
frequented O
her O
. O
They O
my O
- O
loved O
and O
my O
- O
deared O
each O
other O
assiduously O
, O
but O
kept O
apart O
generally O
: O
whereas O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O
multiplied O
avocations O
, O
found O
daily O
time O
to O
see O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
On O
the O
occasion O
of O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
Speaker’s S-ORG
dinner O
, O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
took O
the O
opportunity O
of O
appearing O
before O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
in O
his O
uniform O
— O
that O
old O
diplomatic O
suit O
which O
he O
had O
worn O
when O
attaché O
to O
the O
Pumpernickel S-ORG
legation O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
complimented O
him O
upon O
that O
dress O
, O
and O
admired O
him O
almost O
as O
much O
as O
his O
own O
wife O
and O
children O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
displayed O
himself O
before O
he O
set O
out O
. O
She O
said O
that O
it O
was O
only O
the O
thoroughbred O
gentleman O
who O
could O
wear O
the O
Court S-ORG
suit O
with O
advantage O
: O
it O
was O
only O
your O
men O
of O
ancient O
race O
whom O
the O
culotte O
courte O
became O
. O
Pitt S-PERSON
looked O
down O
with O
complacency O
at O
his O
legs O
, O
which O
had O
not O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
much O
more O
symmetry O
or O
swell O
than O
the O
lean O
Court O
sword O
which O
dangled O
by O
his O
side O
: O
looked O
down O
at O
his O
legs O
, O
and O
thought O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
he O
was O
killing O
. O
When O
he O
was O
gone O
, O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
made O
a O
caricature O
of O
his O
figure O
, O
which O
she O
showed O
to O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
when O
he O
arrived O
. O
His O
lordship O
carried O
off O
the O
sketch O
, O
delighted O
with O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
resemblance O
. O
He O
had O
done O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
the O
honour O
to O
meet O
him O
at O
Mrs. O
Becky’s S-PERSON
house O
, O
and O
had O
been O
most O
gracious O
to O
the O
new O
Baronet S-PERSON
and O
member O
. O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
struck O
too O
by O
the O
deference O
with O
which O
the O
great O
Peer S-PERSON
treated O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
by O
her O
ease O
and O
sprightliness O
in O
the O
conversation O
, O
and O
by O
the O
delight O
with O
which O
the O
other O
men O
of O
the O
party O
listened O
to O
her O
talk O
. O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
made O
no O
doubt O
but O
that O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
had O
only O
commenced O
his O
career O
in O
public O
life O
, O
and O
expected O
rather O
anxiously O
to O
hear O
him O
as O
an O
orator O
| | O
as O
they O
were O
neighbours O
( O
for O
Great B-FAC
Gaunt I-FAC
Street E-FAC
leads O
into O
Gaunt B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
whereof O
Gaunt B-PERSON
House E-PERSON
, O
as O
everybody O
knows O
, O
forms O
one S-CARDINAL
side O
) O
my O
lord O
hoped O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Steyne E-PERSON
arrived O
in O
London S-GPE
she O
would O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
making O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
. O
He O
left O
a O
card O
upon O

In O

all O
Sedley’s S-NORP

Out O
of O
the O
small O
residue O
of O
her O

, O
which O
Amelia S-PERSON
kept O
back O
for O
herself O
, O
the O
widow O
had O
need O
of O
all O
the O
thrift O

care O
possible O
in O
order O
to O
enable O
her O

much O
misgiving O

many O
secret O
pangs O

fears O
on O
her O

part O
, O
she O
had O
been O
induced O
to O
send O
the O
lad O

She O
had O
sate O
up O
of O
nights O
conning O
lessons O
and O
spelling O
over O
crabbed O
grammars O
and O
geography O
books O
in O
order O
to O
teach O
them O
to O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
worked O
even O
at O
the O
Latin S-NORP
accidence O
, O
fondly O
hoping O
that O
she O
might O
be O
capable O
of O
instructing O
him O
in O
that O
language O

To O
part O
with O
him O
all O
day O
: O
to O
send O
him O
out O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
a O
schoolmaster’s O
cane O
and O
his O
schoolfellows’ O
roughness O
, O
was O
almost O
like O
weaning O
him O
over O
again O
, O
to O
that O
weak O
mother O
, O
so O
tremulous O
and O
full O
of O
sensibility O
. O
He O
, O
for O
his O
part O
, O
rushed O
off O
to O
school O
with O
the O
utmost O
happiness O
. O
He O
was O
longing O
for O
the O
change O
. O
That O
childish O
gladness O
wounded O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
herself O
so O
grieved O
to O
part O
with O
him O
. O
She O
would O
rather O
have O
had O
him O
more O
sorry O
, O
she O
thought O
: O
and O
then O
was O
deeply O
repentant O
within O
herself O
, O
for O
daring O
to O
be O
so O
selfish O
as O
to O
wish O
her O
own O
son O
to O
be O
unhappy O
. O
Georgy S-PERSON
made O
great O
progress O
in O
the O
school O
, O
which O
was O
kept O
by O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
mother’s O
constant O
admirer O
, O
the O
Rev. O
Mr. O
Binny S-PERSON
. O
He O
brought O
home O
numberless O
prizes O
and O
testimonials O
of O
ability O
. O
He O
told O
his O
mother O
countless O
stories O
every O
night O
about O
his O
school O
- O
companions O
: O
and O
what O
a O
fine O
fellow O
Lyons S-PERSON
was O
, O
and O
what O
a O
sneak O
Sniffin S-PERSON
was O
| | O
and O
how O
Steel’s S-PERSON
father O
actually O
supplied O
the O
meat O
for O
the O
establishment O
, O
whereas O
Golding’s S-PERSON
mother O
came O
in O
a O
carriage O
to O
fetch O
him O
every O
Saturday S-DATE
: O
and O
how O
Neat O
had O
straps O
to O
his O
trowsers O
— O
might O
he O
have O
straps O
? O
— O
and O
how O
Bull B-PERSON
Major E-PERSON
was O
so O
strong O
( O
though O
only O
in O
Eutropius S-PERSON
) O
that O
it O
was O
believed O
he O
could O
lick O
the O
Usher S-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Ward S-PERSON
, O
himself O
. O
So O
Amelia S-PERSON
learned O
to O
know O
every O
one O
of O
the O
boys O
in O
that O
school O
as O
well O
as O
Georgy S-PERSON
himself O
: O
and O
of O
nights O
she O
used O
to O
help O
him O
in O
his O
exercises O
and O
puzzle O
her O
little O
head O
over O
his O
lessons O
as O
eagerly O
as O
if O
she O
was O
herself O
going O
in O
the O
morning O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
master O

Once O
, O
after O
a O
certain O
combat O
with O
Master O
Smith S-PERSON
, O
George S-PERSON
came O
home O
to O
his O
mother O
with O
a O
black O
eye O
, O
and O
bragged O
prodigiously O
to O
his O
parent O
and O
his O
delighted O
old O
grandfather O
about O
his O
valour O
in O
the O
fight O
, O
in O
which O
, O
if O
the O
truth O
was O
known O
, O
he O
did O
not O
behave O
with O
particular O
heroism O
, O
and O
in O
which O
he O
decidedly O
had O
the O
worst O
. O
But O
Amelia S-PERSON
has O
never O
forgiven O
that O
Smith S-PERSON
to O
this O
day O
, O
though O
he O
is O
now O
a O
peaceful O
apothecary O
near O
Leicester B-FAC

In O
these O
quiet O
labours O
and O
harmless O
cares O
the O
gentle O
widow’s O
life O
was O
passing O
away O

a O
silver O

and O
a O
line O
deepening O
ever O
so O
little O
on O
her O
fair O
forehead O
. O
She O
used O
to O
smile O
at O
these O
marks O
of O
time O
. O
“ O
What O
matters O
it O
, O
” O
she O
asked O
, O
“ O
for O
an O
old O
woman O
like O
me O
? O
” O
All O
she O
hoped O
for O
was O
to O
live O
to O
see O
her O
son O
great O
, O
famous O
, O

glorious O
, O
as O
he O
deserved O

She O
kept O
his O
copybooks O

his O
drawings O

and O
compositions O
, O
and O
showed O
them O
about O
in O
her O
little O
circle O
, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
miracles O
of O
genius O

She O
confided O
some O
of O
these O
specimens O
to O
Miss O

All O

buried O

in O

cackled O

her O

about O

Every O
visit O

the O
little O
cottage O
at O
Brompton S-GPE

guarding O
her O
treasure O
there O
, O
little O
knew O
how O
eagerly O
some O
people O
coveted O
it O
. O
On O
that B-TIME
night E-TIME
when O
Jane B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
had O
told O
her O
father O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
his O
grandson O

the O
old O
man O
had O
made O
her O
no O
reply O

he O
had O
shown O
no O
anger O

had O
bade O
her O
good O
- O
night O
on O
going O
himself O
to O
his O
room O
in O
rather O
a O
kindly O
voice O

And O
he O
must O
have O
meditated O
on O
what O
she O
said O
, O

have O
made O
some O
inquiries O
of O
the O
Dobbin S-PERSON
family O
regarding O
her O
visit O

for O
a O
fortnight O
after O
it O
took O
place O
, O
he O
asked O
her O
where O
was O
her O
little O
French S-NORP
watch O
and O
chain O
she O
used O
to O
wear O

“ O
I O
bought O
it O

my O
money O

sir O

she O
said O
in O
a O
great O
fright O

“ O
Go O

order O
another O
like O
it O

or O
a O
better O
if O
you O
can O
get O
it O

said O
the O
old O
gentleman O
, O

lapsed O
again O
into O
silence O
. O
Of O
late O
the O
Misses B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
more O
than O
once O
repeated O
their O
entreaties O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
to O
allow O
George S-PERSON
to O
visit O
them O
. O
His O
aunt O
had O
shown O
her O
inclination O

perhaps O
his O
grandfather O
himself O
, O
they O
hinted O
, O
might O
be O
disposed O
to O
be O
reconciled O
to O
him O

Surely O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
could O
not O
refuse O
such O
advantageous O
chances O
for O
the O
boy O
. O
Nor O
could O
she O
: O
but O
she O
acceded O
to O
their O
overtures O
with O
a O
very O
heavy O
and O
suspicious O
heart O
, O
was O
always O
uneasy O
during O
the O
child’s O
absence O
from O
her O
, O
and O
welcomed O
him O
back O
as O
if O
he O
was O
rescued O
out O
of O
some O
danger O
. O
He O
brought O
back O
money O

toys O
, O
at O
which O
the O
widow O
looked O
with O
alarm O
and O
jealousy O
: O
she O
asked O
him O
always O
if O
he O
had O
seen O
any O
gentleman O
— O
“ O
Only O
old O
Sir O
William S-PERSON

who O
drove O
him O
about O
in O
the O
four S-CARDINAL

Mr. O

who O
arrived O
on O
the O
beautiful O
bay O
horse O

the O
afternoon O

in O
the O
green O

with O
the O
gold O

show O
him O
the B-FAC
Tower I-FAC

and O
take O
him O
out O
with O
the O
Surrey S-GPE
hounds O
. O
” O
At O
last O
, O
he O
said O
“ O
There O
was O
an O
old O
gentleman O
, O
with O
thick O
eye O
- O
brows O

a O
broad O
hat O

large O
chain O

” O
He O
came O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE

the O
coachman O
was O
lunging O
Georgy S-PERSON
round O
the O
lawn O
on O
the O
gray O
pony O

“ O
He O
looked O
at O
me O
very O
much O

He O
shook O
very O
much O
. O
I O
said O
‘ O
My O
name O
is O
Norval S-PERSON
’ O
after O
dinner O
. O
My O
aunt O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
She O
is O
always O
crying O
. O
” O
Such O
was O
George’s S-PERSON
report O
on O
that B-TIME
night E-TIME
. O
Then O
Amelia S-PERSON
knew O
that O
the O
boy O
had O
seen O
his O
grandfather O
: O
and O
looked O
out O
feverishly O
for O
a O
proposal O
which O
she O
was O
sure O
would O
follow O
, O
and O
which O
came O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
afterwards O
. O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
formally O
offered O
to O
take O
the O
boy O
, O
and O
make O
him O
heir O
to O
the O
fortune O
which O
he O
had O
intended O
that O
his O
father O
should O
inherit O
. O
He O
would O
make O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
an O
allowance O
, O
such O
as O
to O
assure O
her O
a O
decent O
competency O
. O
If O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
proposed O
to O
marry O
again O
, O
as O
Mr. O
O. S-PERSON
heard O
was O
her O
intention O
, O
he O
would O
not O
withdraw O
that O
allowance O
. O
But O
it O
must O
be O
understood O
, O
that O
the O
child O
would O
live O
entirely O
with O
his O
grandfather O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
, O
or O
at O
whatever O
other O
place O
Mr. O
O. S-PERSON
should O
select O

that O

would O
be O
occasionally O
permitted O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
at O
her O
own O
residence O

This O
message O
was O
brought O
or O
read O
in O
a O
letter O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
when O
her O
mother O
was O
from O
home O
, O
and O
her O
father O
absent O
as O
usual O
in O
the O
City O

She O
was O
never O
seen O
angry O
but O
twice O
or O
thrice O
in O
her O
life O
, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
one O
of O
these O
moods O
that O
Mr. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
attorney O
had O
the O
fortune O
to O
behold O
her O
. O
She O
rose O
up O
trembling O
and O
flushing O
very O
much O
as O
soon O
as O
, O
after O
reading O
the O
letter O
, O
Mr. O
Poe S-PERSON
handed O
it O
to O
her O
, O
and O
she O
tore O
the O
paper O
into O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
fragments O
, O
which O
she O
trod O
on O
. O
“ O

it O

I O
wish O
you O
good O
morning O

she O
bowed O
me O
out O
of O
the O
room O
like O
a O
tragedy O
Queen O
, O
” O
said O
the O
lawyer O
who O
told O
the O
story O

parents O
never O
remarked O
her O
agitation O

day O

she O
never O
told O
them O
of O

had O
their O
own O

deeply O
interested O

innocent O

unconscious O
lady O

The O
old O
gentleman O
, O
her O
father O

was O
always O
dabbling O
in O
speculation O

seen O
how O
the B-ORG
Wine I-ORG

failed O
him O

But O
, O
prowling O
about O
the O
City O
always O
eagerly O
and O
restlessly O
still O
, O
he O
lighted O
upon O
some O
other O
scheme O

of O
which O
he O
thought O
so O
well O
that O
he O
embarked O
in O
it O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
remonstrances O
of O
Mr. O
Clapp S-PERSON

to O

indeed O
he O
never O

engaged O
himself O

She O

She O
darned O
the O
old O

She O
cast O
about O
among O
her O
little O

to O
see O
if O
she O

sell O
anything O

she O
kissed O
away O

looked O
after O

how O

not O

It O
was O
the O
mysterious O

the O
poor O

brought O
it O
from O

The O
evil O

broken O
out O
once O

twice O

long O

her O

expiation O

The O
pride O
of O
the O
race O
was O
struck O
down O
as O
the O
firstborn O
of O
Pharaoh S-PERSON

The O
dark O
mark O
of O
fate O
and O
doom O
was O
on O
the O
threshold O

— O
the O
tall O
old O
threshold O
surmounted O
by O
coronets O

The O
absent O

prattled O

grew O
on O
quite O
unconscious O
that O
the O
doom O

over O
them O

First S-ORDINAL
they O
talked O
of O
their O
father O

devised O
plans O
against O
his O
return O

Then O
the O
name O
of O
the O
living O
dead O
man O
was O
less O
frequently O
in O
their O
mouth O
— O
then O
not O
mentioned O
at O
all O
. O
But O
the O
stricken O
old O
grandmother O
trembled O
to O
think O
that O
these O
too O
were O
the O
inheritors O
of O
their O
father’s O
shame O
as O
well O
as O
of O
his O
honours O
: O
and O
watched O
sickening O
for O
the O
day O
when O
the O
awful O
ancestral O
curse O
should O
come O
down O

This O
dark O

also O
haunted O
Lord O

tried O
to O
lay O

lost O
sight O

it O
sometimes O
in O
the O
crowd O

rout O
of O
his O
pleasures O

But O
it O
always O
came O
back O

him O
when O
alone O

seemed O

grow O

“ O

then O
my O

defy O

he O
knew O

, O
drove O
up O

the O

house O
in O
Curio B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
to O
the O
edification O
of O

, O
who O
was O
watching O
from O
his O
green O

grocer’s O

and O
saw O
fine O

enormous O

in O
the O

Sir O

, O
in O
a O

, O
descended O
and O
went O
into O
Curio B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
his O
sword O
between O
his O

. O
Little O
Radon S-PERSON
stood O
with O
his O

against O
the O
parlour O
window O
- O
panes O
, O
smiling O
and O
nodding O
with O
all O
his O

to O
his O
aunt O
in O
the O
carriage O
within O

and O
presently O
Sir O
Pit S-PERSON
issued O
forth O
from O
the O
house O
again O
, O
leading O
forth O
a O
lady O
with O
grand O
feathers O
, O
covered O
in O
a O
white O
shawl O
, O
and O
holding O
up O
daintily O
a O
train O
of O
magnificent O
brocade O
. O
She O
stepped O
into O
the O
vehicle O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
princess O
and O
accustomed O
all O
her O
life O
to O
go O
to O
Court O
, O
smiling O
graciously O
on O
the O
footman O
at O
the O

, O
and O
on O
Sir O
Pit S-PERSON
, O
who O
followed O
her O
into O
the O
carriage O
. O
Then O
Radon S-PERSON
followed O
in O
his O
old O
Guards’ O
uniform O
, O
which O
had O
grown O
wofully O
shabby O
, O
and O
was O
much O
too O
tight O
. O
He O
was O
to O
have O
followed O
the O
procession O
, O
and O
waited O
upon O
his O
sovereign O
in O
a O
cab O
| | O
but O
that O
his O
good O
- O
natured O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
insisted O
that O
they O
should O
be O
a O
family O
party O
. O
The O
coach O
was O
large O
, O
the O
ladies O
not O
very O
big O
, O
they O
would O
hold O
their O
trains O
in O
their O
laps O
— O
finally O
, O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
went O
fraternally O
together O
| | O
and O
their O
carriage O
presently O
joined O
the O
line O
of O
royal O
equipages O
which O
was O
making O
its O
way O
down O
Piccadilly S-GPE
and O
St. B-FAC
James’s I-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
towards O
the O
old O
brick O
palace O
where O
the B-FAC
Star I-FAC
of I-FAC
Brunswick E-FAC
was O
in O
waiting O
to O
receive O
his O
nobles O
and O
gentlefolks O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
felt O
as O
if O
she O
could O
bless O
the O
people O
out O
of O
the O
carriage O
windows O
, O
so O
elated O
was O
she O
in O
spirit O
, O
and O
so O
strong O
a O
sense O
had O
she O
of O
the O
dignified O
position O
which O
she O
had O
at O
last O
attained O
in O
life O
. O
Even O
our O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
her O
weaknesses O
, O
and O
as O
one O
often O
sees O
how O
men O
pride O
themselves O
upon O
excellences O
which O
others O
are O
slow O
to O
perceive O
: O
how O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
Comus S-PERSON
firmly O
believes O
that O
he O
is O
the O
greatest O
tragic O
actor O
in O
England S-GPE
| | O
how O
Brown S-PERSON
, O
the O
famous O
novelist O
, O
longs O
to O
be O
considered O
, O
not O
a O
man O
of O
genius O
, O
but O
a O
man O
of O
fashion O
| | O
while O
Robinson S-PERSON
, O
the O
great O
lawyer O
, O
does O
not O
in O
the O
least O
care O
about O
his O
reputation O
in O
Westminster B-FAC
Hall E-FAC
, O
but O
believes O
himself O
incomparable O
across O
country O
, O
and O
at O
a O
five S-CARDINAL
- O
barred O
gate O
— O
so O
to O
be O
, O
and O
to O
be O
thought O
, O
a O
respectable O
woman O
was O
Becky’s S-PERSON
aim O
in O
life O
, O
and O
she O
got O
up O
the O
genteel O
with O
amazing O
assiduity O
, O
readiness O
, O
and O
success O
. O
We O
have O
said O
, O
there O
were O
times O
when O
she O
believed O
herself O
to O
be O
a O
fine O
lady O
, O
and O
forgot O
that O
there O
was O
no O
money O
in O
the O
chest O
at O
home O
— O
duns O
round O
the O
gate O
, O
tradesmen O
to O
coax O
and O
wheedle O
— O
no O
ground O
to O
walk O
upon O
, O
in O
a O
word O
. O
And O
as O
she O
went O
to O
Court O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
the O
family O
carriage O
, O
she O
adopted O
a O
demeanour O
so O
grand O
, O
self O
- O
satisfied O
, O
deliberate O
, O
and O
imposing O
, O
that O
it O
made O
even O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
laugh O
. O
She O
walked O
into O
the O
royal O
apartments O
with O
a O
toss O
of O
the O
head O
which O
would O
have O
befitted O
an O
empress O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
had O
she O
been O
one O
, O
she O
would O
have O
become O
the O
character O
perfectly O
. O
We O
are O
authorised O
to O
state O
that O
Mrs. O

a O
wholesome O

not O
a O

the O

as O

Such O

as O
those O

which O
we O
catch O

Mrs. O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
dress O
was O
pronounced O
to O
be O
charmante O
on O
the O
eventful O
day O
of O
her O
presentation O
. O
Even O
good O
little O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
was O
forced O
to O
acknowledge O
this O
effect O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
at O
her O
kinswoman O

and O
owned O
sorrowfully O
to O
herself O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
inferior O
in O
taste O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
how O
much O
care O
, O
thought O
, O
and O
genius O
Mrs. O
Radon S-PERSON
had O
bestowed O
upon O
that O
garment O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
as O
good O
taste O
as O
any O
milliner O
in O
Europe S-LOC
, O
and O
such O
a O
clever O
way O
of O
doing O
things O
as O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
little O
understood O
. O
The O
latter O
quickly O
spied O
out O
the O
magnificence O
of O
the O
brocade O
of O
Becky’s S-PRODUCT
train O
, O
and O
the O
splendour O
of O
the O
lace O
on O
her O
dress O
. O
The O
brocade O
was O
an O
old O
remnant O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
said O
| | O
and O
as O
for O
the O
lace O
, O
it O
was O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O
She O
had O
had O
it O
these B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
“ O
My O
dear O
Mrs. O
Crawly O
, O
it O
must O
have O
cost O
a O
little O
fortune O
, O
” O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
said O
, O
looking O
down O
at O
her O
own O
lace O
, O
which O
was O
not O
nearly O
so O
good O
| | O
and O
then O
examining O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
ancient O
brocade O
which O
formed O
the O
material O
of O
Mrs. O
Rawdon’s B-ORG
Court E-ORG
dress O
, O
she O
felt O
inclined O
to O
say O
that O
she O
could O
not O
afford O
such O
fine O
clothing O
, O
but O
checked O
that O
speech O
, O
with O
an O
effort O
, O
as O
one O
uncharitable O
to O
her O
kinswoman O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
if O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
had O
known O
all O
, O
I O
think O
even O
her O
kindly O
temper O
would O
have O
failed O
her O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
when O
she O
was O
putting O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
house O
in O
order O
, O
Mrs. O
Radon S-PERSON
had O
found O
the O
lace O
and O
the O
brocade O
in O
old O
wardrobes O
, O
the O
property O
of O
the O
former O
ladies O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
had O
quietly O
carried O
the O
goods O
home O
, O
and O
had O
suited O
them O
to O
her O
own O
little O
person O
. O
Brigs O
saw O
her O
take O
them O
, O
asked O
no O
questions O
, O
told O
no O
stories O
| | O
but O
I O
believe O
quite O
sympathized O
with O
her O
on O
this O
matter O
, O
and O
so O
would O
many O
another O
honest O
woman O
. O
And O
the O
diamonds O
— O
“ O
Where O
the O
loose O
did O
you O
get O
the O
diamonds O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
? O
” O
said O
her O
husband O
, O
admiring O
some O
jewels O
which O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
before O
, O
and O
which O
sparkled O
in O
her O
ears O
and O
on O
her O
neck O
with O
brilliance O
and O
profusion O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
blushed O
a O
little O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
him O
hard O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
Pit O
Crawly O
blushed O
a O
little O
too O
, O

looked O
out O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
he O

given O
her O

very O
small O
portion O

the O
brilliant O

a O
pretty O
diamond O
clasp O

which O
confined O
a O
pearl O

which O
she O
wore O

and O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
had O
omitted O
to O
mention O
the O
circumstances O
to O
his O
lady O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
then O
at O
Sir O
Pit S-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
saucy O
triumph O
— O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
“ O
Shall O
I O
betray O
you O
? O
” O
“ O
Guess O
! O
” O
she O
said O
to O
her O
husband O

“ O
Why O
, O
you O
silly O
man O

” O
she O
continued O
, O
“ O
where O
do O
you O

all O

the O

a O

me O
long O

I O
hired O

sure O

I O
hired O
them O
at O
Mr. O
Polonius’s S-PERSON
, O
in O
Coventry B-FAC
Street E-FAC
. O
You O
don’t O
suppose O
that O
all O
the O
diamonds O
which O
go O
to O
Court S-ORG
belong O
to O
the O
wearers O

like O
those O
beautiful O
stones O
which O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
has O
, O
and O
which O
are O
much O

” O
“ O
They O
are O
family O
jewels O

said O
Sir O

, O
again O
looking O
uneasy O

And O
in O
this O
family O
conversation O
the O
carriage O
rolled O
down O

until O
its O

discharged O

never O

Mr. O

and O
that O

never O
applied O

they O
retired O
into O

valuable O

many O

audaciously O
about O
the O

to O
back O
away O
rapidly O

silently O

respectfully O

profound O
bows O
out O
of O
the B-EVENT
August I-EVENT

This O
may O
be O
said O

that O
in O
all O
London S-GPE
there O
was O
no O
more O
loyal O
heart O
than O
Becky’s S-PERSON
after O
this O
interview O
. O
The O
name O
of O
her O
king O
was O
always O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
and O
he O
was O
proclaimed O
by O
her O
to O
be O
the O
most O
charming O
of O
men O
. O
She O
went O
to O
Colnaghi’s S-PERSON
and O
ordered O
the O
finest O
portrait O
of O
him O
that O
art O
had O
produced O
, O
and O
credit O
could O
supply O
. O
She O
chose O
that O
famous O
one O
in O
which O
the O
best O
of O
monarchs O
is O
represented O
in O
a O
frockcoat O
with O
a O
fur O
collar O

breeches O

silk O
stockings O
, O
simpering O
on O
a O
sofa O
from O
under O
his O
curly O
brown O
wig O
. O
She O
had O
him O
painted O
in O
a O
brooch O
and O
wore O
it O
— O
indeed O
she O
amused O
and O
somewhat O
pestered O
her O
acquaintance O
with O
her O
perpetual O
talk O
about O
his O
urbanity O
and O
beauty O
. O
Who O
knows O
? O
Perhaps O
the O
little O
woman O
thought O
she O
might O
play O
the O
part O
of O
a O
Maintenon S-PERSON
or O
a O
Pompadour S-PERSON
. O
But O
the O
finest O
sport O
of O
all O
after O
her O
presentation O
was O
to O
hear O
her O
talk O
virtuously O
. O
She O
had O
a O
few O
female O
acquaintances O
, O
not O
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O

of O
the O
very O
highest O

But O
being O
made O
an O
honest O
woman O
of O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
would O
not O
consort O
any O
longer O
with O
these O
dubious O
ones O
, O
and O
cut O
Lady B-PERSON
Crackenbury E-PERSON

the O

nodded O
to O
her O

Mrs. O

found O
his O

cards O
already O
ranged O
as O
the O

of O
Becky’s O
hand O
, O

grinned O
, O
as O
this O
old O
cynic O

did O
at O
any O

of O

Becky S-PERSON
came O

she O
seated O

agreeable O
posture O
ready O
to O
receive O
him O
— O
whenever O
she O
was O
surprised O

She O
found O
him O
grinning O
over O
the O

She O
was O
discovered O

and O
she O
blushed O
a O
little O
. O
“ O
Thank O

Monseigneur S-PERSON

she O
said O

“ O
You O

How O

“ O
I O

the O
old O

“ O
You O

she O
replied O

“ O

“ O

no O

you O
were O

to O
my O
Lady B-PERSON
Gaunt E-PERSON
, O

I O

you O
came O
downstairs O

” O
“ O

” O
answered O
Mrs. O
Radon S-PERSON
plaintively O
, O
and O
she O
rubbed O
her O
cheek O
with O
her O
handkerchief O
as O
if O
to O
show O
there O
was O
no O
rouge O
at O
all O
, O
only O
genuine O
blushes O

modesty O
in O
her O
case O

About O
this O
who O
can O
tell O
? O
I O
know O
there O

some O

come O
off O
on O
a O
pocket O

handkerchief O

and O
some O
so O
good O
that O
even O
tears O
will O
not O
disturb O
it O
. O
“ O
Well O

said O
the O
old O
gentleman O
, O
twiddling O
round O
his O
wife’s O
card O

“ O

This O

Brigs O

up O

table O
at O

she O
was O
seated O
in O
the O
farther O

gave O
a O
deep O
sigh O

she O
heard O
the O

so O
lightly O

“ O
If O

with O
a O
savage O

“ O

said O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
mischievously O

and O
having O
enjoyed O
for O
some O
time O
the O
discomfiture O
of O
my O

with O
the O
fair O
Colonel’s S-NORP

Mrs. O

length O
had O
pity O
upon O
her O
admirer O

calling O
to O
Brigs O
, O
praised O
the O
fineness O
of O
the O
weather O
to O
her O
, O
and O
bade O
her O
to O
take O
out O
the O
child O
for O
a O
walk O
. O
“ O
I O
can’t O
send O
her O
away O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
said O
presently O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
and O
in O
a O
very O
sad O
voice O
. O
Her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
as O
she O
spoke O
, O

she O
turned O
away O
her O
head O
. O
“ O
You O
owe O
her O
her O
wages O
, O
I O
suppose O
? O
” O
said O
the O
Peer O
. O
“ O
Worse O
than O
that O
, O
” O
said O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
still O
casting O
down O
her O
eyes O

“ O
I O
have O
ruined O
her O

” O
“ O
Ruined O

— O
then O
why O
don’t O
you O
turn O
her O
out O

” O
the O
gentleman O
asked O
. O
“ O
Men O
do O
that O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
answered O
bitterly O
. O
“ O
Women O
are O
not O
so O
bad O
as O
you O

Last B-DATE

us O
everything O

She O
shall O
never O
leave O
me O
, O
until O
we O
are O
ruined O
utterly O
ourselves O
, O
which O
does O
not O
seem O
far O
off O

until O
I O
can O
pay O
her O
the O
utmost O
farthing O

” O
“ O
— O
— O
it O
, O
how O
much O
is O
it O
? O
” O
said O
the O
Peer O
, O
with O
an O
oath O
. O
And O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
reflecting O
on O
the O
largeness O
of O
his O
means O
, O
mentioned O
not O
only O
the O
sum O
which O
she O
had O
borrowed O
from O
Miss B-ORG
Brigs E-ORG
, O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
nearly O
double O
the O
amount O
. O
This O
caused O
the O
Lord O
Stere S-PERSON
to O
break O
out O
in O
another O
brief O
and O
energetic O
expression O
of O
anger O
, O
at O
which O
Rebecca S-PERSON
held O
down O
her O
head O
the O
more O
, O
and O
cried O
bitterly O
. O
“ O
I O
could O
not O
help O
it O

It O
was O
my O
only O
chance O

I O
dare O
not O
tell O
my O
husband O

He O
would O
kill O
me O
if O
I O
told O
him O
what O
I O

I O
have O
kept O
it O
a O
secret O
from O
everybody O

you O
— O

you O
forced O
it O
from O
me O

Ah O
, O
what O
shall O
I O
do O
, O
Lord O
Stere S-PERSON
? O
for O
I O
am O
very O
, O
very O
unhappy O
! O
” O
Lord O
Stere S-PERSON
made O
no O
reply O
except O
by O
beating O
the O
devil’s O
tattoo O
, O
and O
biting O
his O
nails O
. O
At O
last O
he O
clapped O
his O
hat O
on O
his O
head O
, O
and O
flung O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
did O
not O
rise O
from O
her O
attitude O
of O
misery O
until O
the O
door O
slammed O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
his O
carriage O
whirled O
away O
. O
Then O
she O
rose O
up O
with O
the O
queerest O
expression O
of O
victorious O
mischief O
glittering O
in O
her O
green O
eyes O
. O
She O
burst O
out O
laughing O
once O
or O
twice O
to O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
sate O
at O
work O

and O
sitting O
down O
to O
the O
piano O
, O
she O
rattled O
away O
a O
triumphant O
voluntary O
on O
the O
keys O
, O
which O
made O
the O
people O
pause O
under O
her O
window O
to O

to O
her O
brilliant O
music O

It O
was O
only O

she O
said O

which O
amused O
her O
so O

But O
the O
truth O

that O
she O

occupied O

Rawdon S-PERSON

him O
the O

Lady B-PERSON

exchanged O
terrified O

angry O

When O
the O

to O

She O
asked O

The O
foreign O

thought O
that O
she O

a O
lady O

great O
distinction O

and O
the O
Prince O

the O

of O
Lord O

himself O

it O
was O
when O
the O
ladies O
were O
alone O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
knew O
the O
tug O
of O
war O

come O

And O
then O
indeed O
the O
little O
woman O
found O
herself O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
as O
made O
her O
acknowledge O
the O
correctness O
of O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
caution O
to O
her O
to O
beware O
of O
the O

When O
poor O
little O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
alone O
with O
the O

went O
up O

they O
dropped O
off O
one S-CARDINAL

again O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
speak O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O

( O

the O

treated O
with O
such O
cruelty O
finally O
, O
that O
even O
Lady O
Steyne S-PERSON
herself O
pitied O
her O
, O
and O
went O
up O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
friendless O
little O
woman O
. O
“ O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
as O
her O
wan O
cheeks O
glowed O
with O
a O

“ O

sincerely O
grateful O

seating O
herself O
at O
the O

sang O
religious O
songs O

which O
had O
been O
early O
favourites O
of O
Lady B-PERSON

with O
such O
sweetness O
and O
tenderness O
that O
the O
lady O
, O
lingering O
round O
the O
piano O
, O
sate O
down O
by O
its O
side O

and O
listened O
until O
the O
tears O
rolled O
down O
her O
eyes O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
opposition O
ladies O
at O
the O

of O
the O
room O
kept O
up O
a O

the B-PERSON
Lady I-PERSON
Steyne E-PERSON
did O
not O
hear O

She O
was O
a O

her O

out O

she O
started O
when O
the O

doors O
were O
flung O
open O

with O
a O
loud O
laugh O
from O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON

the O

full O

He O
went O

spoke O
to O

called O
her O
by O
her O
Christian S-NORP

so O
as O
again O

bring O

“ O

how O

violent O

She O
grows O
daily S-DATE
more O

worn O

sad O
: O
fixing O
upon O
her O
child O
alarmed O
eyes O

whereof O
the O
little O

up O

little O
now O

A O
constant O
thought O

terror O

her O

How O
she O
weeps O

prays O
in O
the O
long O
silent O
nights O

how O
she O

hide O

the O
thought O

return O
to O
her O

that O
she O
ought O

part O

Some O

Oh O

it O

A O

comes O
over O
her O
which O
makes O
her O
blush O

turn O
from O
herself O
, O
— O
her O
parents O
might O
keep O
the O

the O

no O

she O
could O
never O

she O
had O

One S-CARDINAL
truth O
after O
another O

marshalling O
itself O
silently O
against O

keeping O
its O

Poverty O

degradation O

injustice O

one S-CARDINAL
by O
one O
the O
outworks O
of O
the O
little O
citadel O
were O
taken O
, O
in O
which O
the O
poor O
soul O
passionately O
guarded O
her O
only O
love O
and O
treasure O
. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
struggle O
, O
she O
had O
written O
off O
a O
letter O
of O
tender O
supplication O
to O
her O
brother O
at O
Calcutta S-GPE
, O
imploring O
him O

withdraw O
the O
support O

he O
had O
granted O
to O
their O
parents O

artless O

their O
lonely O

hapless O
condition O

She O
did O
not O
know O
the O
truth O

the O
matter O

The O
payment O
of O
Jos’s S-ORG
annuity O
was O
still O
regular O
: O
but O
it O
was O
a O
money O

lender O
in O
the O
City O
who O
was O
receiving O
it O
: O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON

sold O
it O

a O
sum O
of O
money O
wherewith O
to O
prosecute O
his O
bootless O
schemes O

Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
calculating O

the O
time O
that O

elapse O

the O

the O
day O

To O
her O
son’s O
guardian O
, O
the O
good O
Major O
at O
Madras S-GPE

she O
had O
not O

She O
had O
not O

congratulate O
him O
on O

She O
thought O

sickening O
despondency O

that O

One S-CARDINAL
day O

a O
very O
bad O

the O

in O
hysteric O
grief O

the O

in O
more O

the O
inmates O

secretly O

telling O

She O
had O
written O

Joseph S-PERSON
— O
an O
answer O
must O
come O
in O
three B-DATE
or I-DATE
four I-DATE
months E-DATE
. O
He O
was O
always O
generous O
, O
though O
careless O
. O
He O
could O
not O
refuse O
, O
when O
he O
knew O
how O
straitened O
were O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
parents O
. O
Then O
the O
poor O
old O
gentleman O
revealed O
the O
whole O
truth O
to O
her O
— O
that O
his O
son O
was O
still O
paying O
the O
annuity O
, O
which O
his O
own O
imprudence O
had O
flung O
away O
. O
He O
had O
not O
dared O
to O
tell O
it O
sooner O
. O
He O
thought O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
ghastly O
and O
terrified O
look O
, O
when O
, O
with O
a O
trembling O
, O
miserable O
voice O
he O
made O
the O
confession O
, O
conveyed O
reproaches O
to O
him O
for O
his O
concealment O
. O
“ O
Ah O
! O
” O
said O
he O
, O
with O
quivering O
lips O
and O
turning O
away O
, O
“ O
you O
despise O
your O
old O
father O
now O
! O
” O
“ O
O O
papa O
! O
it O
is O
not O
that O
, O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
cried O
out O
, O
falling O
on O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
kissing O
him O
many O
times O
. O
“ O
You O
are O
always O
good O

kind O

You O
did O
it O
for O
the O
best O

It O
is O
not O

the O
money O

it O

O O
my O

trial O

” O
and O
she O
kissed O
him O
again O
wildly O
, O
and O
went O
away O
. O
Still O
the O
father O
did O
not O
know O
what O
that O
explanation O
meant O
, O
and O
the O
burst O
of O
anguish O
with O
which O
the O
poor O
girl O
left O
him O
. O
It O
was O
that O
she O
was O
conquered O

The O
sentence O
was O
passed O

The O
child O
must O
go O
from O
her O

Her O

her O

her O

almost O

She O
must O
give O
him O
up O

and O
then O
— O
and O
then O
she O
would O
go O
to O
George S-PERSON

they O
would O
watch O
over O
the O

wait O
for O
him O
until O
he O
came O
to O
them O

She O
put O
on O
her O
bonnet O
, O
scarcely O
knowing O
what O
she O
did O
, O
and O
went O
out O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
lanes O
by O
which O
George S-PERSON
used O
to O
come O
back O

in O
the O

his O
bundle O

There O

Both O

No O

said O

stooped O
down O

kissed O
him O

That O
night O
Amelia S-PERSON
made O
the O
boy O
read O
the O
story O
of O
Samuel S-PERSON
to O
her O
, O
and O
how O
Hannah S-PERSON
, O
his O

having O
weaned O
him O

brought O
him O
to O

High I-PERSON
Priest E-PERSON
to O
minister O
before O

And O
he O
read O
the O
song O
of O
gratitude O
which O
Hannah S-PERSON
san O
and O
which O
says O
, O
who O
it O
is O
who O
maketh O
poor O
and O
maketh O
rich O
, O
and O
bringeth O
low O

exalteth O
— O
how O
the O
poor O
shall O
be O
raised O
up O
out O
of O
the O
dust O

and O
how O
, O
in O
his O
own O
might O
, O
no O
man O
shall O
be O
strong O
. O
Then O
he O
read O
how O
Samuel’s S-PERSON
mother O
made O
him O
a O
little O
coat O
, O
and O
brought O
it O
to O
him O
from O

she O
came O
up O

offer O
the O
yearly O

And O
then O
, O
in O
her O
sweet O
simple O
way O
, O
George’s S-PERSON
mother O
made O
commentaries O
to O
the O
boy O
upon O
this O
affecting O
story O
. O
How O
Hannah S-PERSON
, O
though O
she O
loved O
her O
son O
so O
much O
, O
yet O
gave O
him O
up O
because O
of O
her O
vow O
. O
And O
how O
she O
must O
always O
have O
thought O
of O
him O
as O
she O
sat O
at O
home O
, O
far O
away O

making O
the O
little O
coat O

and O
Samuel S-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
sure O
, O
never O
forgot O
his O
mother O
: O
and O
how O
happy O
she O
must O
have O
been O
as O
the O
time O
came O
( O
and O
the O
years O
pass O
away O
very O
quick O
) O
when O
she O
should O
see O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
how O
good O
and O
wise O
he O
had O
grown O
. O
This O
little O
sermon O
she O
spoke O
with O
a O
gentle O
solemn O
voice O
, O
and O
dry O
eyes O
, O
until O
she O
came O
to O
the O
account O
of O
their O
meeting O
— O
then O
the O
discourse O
broke O
off O
suddenly O
, O
the O
tender O
heart O
overflowed O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
boy O
to O
her O
breast O
, O
she O
rocked O
him O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
wept O
silently O
over O
him O
in O
a O
sainted O
agony O
of O
tears O
. O
Her O
mind O
being O
made O
up O

such O
measures O

seemed O
right O
to O
her O
for O
advancing O
the O
end O

proposed O

One S-CARDINAL
day O
, O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
( O

wrote O
the O
superscription O
) O
— O
one O
day O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
got O
a O
letter O
from O
Amelia S-PERSON
which O
made O
her O
blush O
very O
much O
and O
look O
towards O
her O
father O
, O
sitting O
glooming O
in O
his O
place O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
table O
. O
In O
simple O
terms O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
told O
her O
reasons O
which O
had O
induced O
her O
to O
change O
her O
mind O
respecting O
her O
boy O
. O
Her O
father O
had O
met O
with O
fresh O
misfortunes O
which O
had O
entirely O
ruined O
him O
. O
Her O
own O
pittance O
was O
so O
small O
that O
it O
would O
barely O
enable O
her O
to O
support O
her O
parents O
, O
and O
would O
not O
suffice O
to O
give O
George S-PERSON
the O
advantages O
which O
were O
his O
due O
. O
Great O
as O
her O
sufferings O
would O
be O
at O
parting O
with O
him O
she O
would O
, O
by O
God’s O
help O
, O
endure O
them O
for O
the O
boy’s O
sake O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
those O
to O
whom O
he O
was O
going O
would O
do O
all O
in O
their O
power O
to O
make O
him O
happy O
. O
She O
described O
his O
disposition O
, O
such O
as O
she O
fancied O
it O
| | O
quick O
and O
impatient O
of O
control O
or O
harshness O
| | O
easily O
to O
be O
moved O
by O
love O
and O
kindness O
. O
In O
a O
postscript O
, O
she O
stipulated O
that O
she O
should O
have O
a O
written O
agreement O
, O
that O
she O
should O
see O
the O
child O
as O
often O
as O
she O
wished O
, O
— O
she O
could O
not O
part O
with O
him O
under O
any O
other O
terms O
. O
“ O
What O
? O
Mrs. O
Pride S-PERSON
has O
come O
down O
, O
has O
she O
? O
” O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
, O
when O
with O
a O
tremulous O
eager O
voice O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
read O
him O
the O
letter O
— O
“ O
Reg’lar S-PERSON
starved O
out O
, O
hey O
? O
ha O
, O

! O
I O
knew O
she O
would O
. O
” O
He O
tried O
to O
keep O
his O
dignity O
and O
to O
read O
his O
paper O
as O
usual O
— O
but O
he O
could O
not O
follow O
it O
. O
He O
chuckled O
and O
swore O
to O
himself O
behind O
the O
sheet O
. O
At O
last O
he O
flung O
it O
down O
: O
and O
scowling O
at O
his O
daughter O
, O
as O
his O
wont O
was O
, O
went O
out O
of O
the O
room O
into O
his O
study O
adjoining O
, O
from O
whence O
he O
presently O
returned O
with O
a O
key O
. O
He O
flung O
it O
to O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Get O

he O
said O

“ O

his O

a O

Ah O

what O

The O

still O
on O
the O

, O
was O
blotted O
with O

Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
much O
affected O
when O
she O
first S-ORDINAL
entered O
this O
room O
with O
the O
servants O
under O
her O

She O
sank O
quite O
pale O
on O
the O

“ O
This O

“ O
You O

Mr. O

before O

But O
she O

So O
look O
out O

get O
things O
right O

” O
With O
which O
brief O
speeches O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
took O
leave O
of O
his O
daughter O

went O
on O
his O
accustomed O
way O
into O
the O

“ O
Here O
, O
Papa S-PERSON
, O
is O
some O
money O

Amelia S-PERSON
said O
that O
night O
, O
kissing O
the O
old O
man O

her O
father O

She O
could O
say O
nothing O

walked O
away O
silently O

her O

Let O
us O
close O
it O
upon O
her O
prayers O

her O
sorrow O

I O

Miss O

saw O
Amelia S-PERSON

The O
meeting O
between O

was O
friendly O
. O
A O
look O
and O
a O
few O
words O
from O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
showed O
the O
poor O
widow O
that O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
this O
woman O
at O
least O
, O
there O
need O
be O
no O
fear O
lest O
she O
should O
take O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
in O
her O
son’s O
affections O
. O
She O
was O
cold O
, O
sensible O
, O
not O
unkind O
. O
The O
mother O
had O
not O
been O
so O
well O
pleased O
, O
perhaps O
, O
had O
the O
rival O
been O
better O
looking O
, O
younger O
, O
more O
affectionate O

warmer O

Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
on O
the O

thought O
of O
old O
times O

could O
not O

be O
touched O
with O
the O
poor O
mother’s O
pitiful O
situation O

She O
was O
conquered O

and O
laying O
down O
her O
arms O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
she O
humbly O
submitted O

That O
day O
they O
arranged O

the O
preliminaries O

George S-PERSON

saw O
his O

Amelia S-PERSON
left O
them O
alone O
together O

and O
went O
to O
her O
room O

She O
was O
trying O
the O
separation O
: O
— O
as O
that O
poor O
gentle O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
Grey E-PERSON
felt O
the O
edge O

the O
axe O

The O

the O

Georgy S-PERSON
with O
great O
caution O

she O
looked O
to O
see O
him O
very O
much O
affected O
by O
the O
intelligence O
. O
He O
was O
rather O
elated O
than O
otherwise O
, O
and O
the O
poor O
woman O
turned O
sadly O
away O
. O
He O
bragged O
about O
the O
news O
that O
day O
to O
the O
boys O
at O
school O

told O
them O
how O
he O
was O
going O

live O
with O
his O
grandpapa O

his O
father’s O
father O

not O
the O

that O
he O
would O
be O
very O
rich O

have O
a O
carriage O

and O
a O
pony O

go O
to O
a O
much O
finer O
school O

when O
he O
was O
rich O
he O

buy O
Leader’s O
pencil O

case O

pay O
the O
tart O

woman O

The O
boy O
was O
the O
image O
of O
his O
father O

as O
his O
fond O
mother O
thought O

Indeed O
I O

no O

on O
account O
of O
our O

At O
last O

up O

the O
little O
humble O

tokens O
of O

disposed O
in O
the O

George S-PERSON
was O
in O
his O
new O
suit O

for O
which O
the O
tailor O
had O
come O
previously O

measure O
him O

He O
had O
sprung O
up O
with O
the O

put O
on O
the O
new O
clothes O

his O

hearing O
him O
from O
the O

she O
had O
been O
lying O

talking O
with O
him O

preparing O
him O
for O
the O
change O
— O
fondly O
fancying O
that O
he O
needed O
preparation O

So O
that O
he O
had O
change O
, O
what O
cared O
he O
? O
He O
was O
longing O
for O
it O

By O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
eager O
declarations O
as O
to O
what O
he O
would O
do O
, O
when O
he O
went O
to O
live O
with O
his O
grandfather O
, O
he O
had O
shown O
the O
poor O
widow O
how O
little O
the O
idea O
of O
parting O
had O
cast O
him O
down O
. O
“ O
He O
would O
come O
and O
see O
his O
mamma O
often O
on O
the O
pony O

he O
said O

everything O

” O
The O
poor O
mother O
was O
fain O
to O
content O
herself O
with O
these O
selfish O
demonstrations O
of O
attachment O

tried O
to O
convince O
herself O
how O
sincerely O
her O
son O
loved O
her O
. O
He O
must O
love O
her O

All O

a O

denied O
him O

debasement O

self O
- O
humiliation O
of O
a O

How O
she O

that O
it O

not O
the O

how O

how O

It O
is O
those O
who O
injure O

who O
get O
the O

So O
poor O
Amelia S-PERSON
had O
been O
getting O
ready O
in O
silent O
misery O
for O
her O

hour O
in O

George S-PERSON

Tears O

of O
all O
these O

the O

no O

The O

goes O
away O
smiling O

the O

By O

it O

the O

A O

the O

The O

He O

At O

House I-ORG
Becky E-ORG
met O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
finest O

greatest O

then O
Ambassador O

the O
Most O
Christian O
King O

and O
subsequently O
Minister O
to O
that O
monarch O
. O
I O
declare O
I O
swell O
with O
pride O
as O
these O
august O
names O
are O
transcribed O
by O
my O
pen O

and O
I O
think O
in O
what O
brilliant O
company O
my O
dear O
Becky S-PERSON
is O
moving O
. O
She O
became O
a O
constant O
guest O
at O
the B-ORG
French I-ORG
Embassy E-ORG
, O
where O
no O
party O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
complete O
without O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
charming O
Madame B-PERSON
Ravdonn I-PERSON
Cravley E-PERSON
. O
Messieurs B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Truffigny E-PERSON
( O
of O
the O
Périgord S-NORP
family O
) O
and O
Champignac S-ORG
, O
both O
attachés O
of O
the O
Embassy S-ORG
, O
were O
straightway O
smitten O
by O
the O
charms O
of O
the O
fair O
Colonel’s S-NORP
wife O
: O
and O
both O
declared O
, O
according O
to O
the O
wont O
of O
their O
nation O
, O
( O
for O
who O
ever O
yet O
met O
a O
Frenchman S-NORP
, O
come O
out O
of O
England S-GPE

that O
has O
not O
left O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen E-CARDINAL
families O
miserable O
, O
and O
brought O
away O
as O
many O
hearts O
in O
his O
pocket O
- O
book O
? O
) O
both O
, O
I O
say O
, O
declared O
that O
they O
were O
au O
mieux O
with O
the O
charming O
Madame O
Ravdonn S-PERSON
. O
But O
I O
doubt O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
assertion O
. O
Champignac S-PERSON
was O
very O
fond O
of O
écarté O
, O
and O
made O
many O
parties O
with O
the O
Colonel O
of O
evenings O
, O
while O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
singing O
to O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
in O
the O
other O
room O
| | O
and O
as O
for O
Truffigny S-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
fact O
that O
he O
dared O
not O
go O
to O
the O
Travellers O
’ O
, O
where O
he O
owed O
money O
to O
the O
waiters O
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
not O
had O
the O
Embassy S-ORG
as O
a O
dining O
- O
place O
, O
the O
worthy O
young O
gentleman O
must O
have O
starved O
. O
I O
doubt O
, O
I O
say O
, O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
would O
have O
selected O
either O
of O
these O
young O
men O
as O
a O
person O
on O
whom O
she O
would O
bestow O
her O
special O
regard O
. O
They O
ran O
of O
her O
messages O
, O
purchased O
her O
gloves O
and O
flowers O
, O
went O
in O
debt O
for O
opera- O
boxes O
for O
her O
, O
and O
made O
themselves O
amiable O
in O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
ways O
. O
And O
they O
talked O
English S-LANGUAGE
with O
adorable O
simplicity O
, O
and O
to O
the O
constant O
amusement O
of O
Becky S-PERSON
and O
my O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
she O
would O
mimic O
one O
or O
other O
to O
his O
face O
, O
and O
compliment O
him O
on O
his O
advance O
in O
the O
English S-LANGUAGE
language O
with O
a O
gravity O
which O
never O
failed O
to O
tickle O
the O
Marquis S-PERSON
, O
her O
sardonic O
old O
patron O
. O
Truffigny S-PERSON
gave O
Briggs S-PERSON
a O
shawl O
by O
way O
of O
winning O
over O
Becky’s S-PERSON
confidante O
, O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
a O
letter O
which O
the O
simple O
spinster O
handed O
over O
in O
public O
to O
the O
person O
to O
whom O
it O
was O
addressed O

and O
the O
composition O
of O
which O
amused O
everybody O
who O
read O
it O
greatly O
. O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
read O
it O
: O
everybody O

honest O
Rawdon S-PERSON

to O

it O
was O
not O

She O
was O
an O
artist O
herself O

as O
she O
said O
very O
truly O
: O
there O
was O
a O
frankness O

humility O
in O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
acknowledged O
her O
origin O

provoked O

“ O

Becky S-PERSON
went O
her O
own O
way O

so O
fascinated O
the O

Becky’s S-PERSON

one S-CARDINAL

that O

The O

, O
that O

by O
a O
sparing O
use O

for O

, O
to O
make O
a O
great O

with O
very O
little O

and O
it O
is O
our O
belief O
that O
Becky’s S-PERSON
much O

talked O

of O

which O
were O
not O

I O
protest O
it O
is O
quite O
shameful O
in O
the O

to O
abuse O

I O
warn O
the O

believing O
one B-CARDINAL

tenth E-CARDINAL
of O
the O

against O

If O

what O
a O

the O

Our O

avoid O
those O

Whereas O
, O
by O
a O

things O
are O
made O
to O
go O
on O
pleasantly O

: O
we O
may O
abuse O
a O

as O
much O
as O
we O
like O

and O
call O
him O
the O

but O
do O
we O
wish O

hang O
him O
therefore O
? O
No O

We O
shake O
hands O

If O
his O

we O

ask O
me O
why O
her O
breath O
is O
sweet O
and O
why O
her O
cheek O
is O
blooming O
, O
It O
is O
because O
the O
sun O
is O
out O

birds O
begin O
to O
sing O
, O
The O
nightingale O

melody O
is O
through O

silent O
when O
the O
boughs O

bare O

blowing O
keen O
: O
And O
if O
, O
Mamma S-PERSON
, O
you O
ask O
of O
me O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
singing O
, O
It O
is O
because O
the O
sun O
is O
out O
and O
all O
the O
leaves O

green O

there’s O
sunshine O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
Mamma O

which O
wakens O
and O
rejoices O
, O
And O
so O
I O
sing O
and O
blush O
, O
Mamma O
, O
and O
that’s O
the O
reason O
why O

During O
the O
intervals O

the O
stanzas O

this O
ditty O

the O
good O

the O
singer O
, O
and O
whose O
large O
whiskers O
appeared O
under O
her O
cap O

seemed O
very O
anxious O
to O
exhibit O
her O
maternal O
affection O
by O
embracing O
the O
innocent O
creature O
who O
performed O
the O
daughter’s O
part O

Every O
caress O
was O
received O
with O
loud O
acclamations O
of O
laughter O
by O
the O
sympathising O
audience O

At O
its O
conclusion O
( O
while O
the O
music O
was O
performing O
a O
symphony O
as O
if O
ever O
so O
many O
birds O
were O
warbling O
) O
the O
whole O
house O
was O
unanimous O
for O
an O
encore O
: O
and O
applause O
and O
bouquets O
without O
end O
were O
showered O
upon O
the O
NIGHTINGALE O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
voice O
of O
applause O
was O
loudest O
of O
all O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
the O
nightingale O
, O
took O
the O
flowers O
which O
he O
threw O
to O
her O
, O
and O
pressed O
them O
to O
her O
heart O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
consummate O
comedian O
. O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
was O
frantic O
with O
delight O
. O
His O
guests’ O
enthusiasm O
harmonised O
with O
his O
own O
. O
Where O
was O
the O
beautiful O
black O
- O
eyed O
Houri S-PERSON
whose O
appearance O
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
charade O
had O
caused O
such O
delight O
? O
She O
was O
twice O
as O
handsome O
as O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
but O
the O
brilliancy O
of O
the O
latter O
had O
quite O
eclipsed O
her O
. O
All O
voices O
were O
for O
her O
. O
Stephens S-PERSON
, O
Caradori S-PERSON
, O
Ronzi B-PERSON

Begnis E-PERSON
, O
people O
compared O
her O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
the O
other O
, O
and O
agreed O
with O
good O
reason O
, O
very O
likely O
, O
that O
had O
she O
been O
an O
actress O
none O
on O
the O
stage O
could O
have O
surpassed O
her O
. O
She O
had O
reached O
her O
culmination O
: O
her O
voice O
rose O
trilling O
and O
bright O
over O
the O
storm O
of O
applause O
: O
and O
soared O
as O
high O
and O
joyful O
as O
her O
triumph O
. O
There O
was O
a O
ball O
after O
the O
dramatic O
entertainments O
, O
and O
everybody O
pressed O
round O
Becky S-PERSON
as O
the O
great O
point O
of O
attraction O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
The O
Royal O
Personage O
declared O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
that O
she O
was O
perfection O
, O
and O
engaged O
her O
again O
and O
again O
in O
conversation O
. O
Little O
Becky’s S-PERSON
soul O
swelled O
with O
pride O
and O
delight O
at O
these O
honours O
| | O
she O
saw O
fortune O
, O
fame O
, O
fashion O
before O
her O
. O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
was O
her O
slave O
| | O
followed O
her O
everywhere O
, O
and O
scarcely O
spoke O
to O
any O
one O
in O
the O
room O
beside O
| | O
and O
paid O
her O
the O
most O
marked O
compliments O
and O
attention O
. O
She O
still O
appeared O
in O
her O
Marquise S-PERSON
costume O
, O
and O
danced O
a O
minuet O
with O
Monsieur B-WORK_OF_ART

, O
Monsieur B-WORK_OF_ART

the O
Duke S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
all O
the O
traditions O
of O
the O
ancient O
court O
, O
pronounced O
that O
Madame B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
was O
worthy O
to O
have O
been O
a O
pupil O
of O
Vestris S-PERSON
, O
or O
to O
have O
figured O
at O
Versailles S-GPE
. O
Only O
a O
feeling O
of O
dignity O
, O
the O
gout O
, O
and O
the O
strongest O
sense O
of O
duty O
and O
personal O
sacrifice O
, O
prevented O
his O
Excellency O
from O
dancing O
with O
her O
himself O
| | O
and O
he O
declared O
in O
public O
, O
that O
a O
lady O
who O
could O
talk O
and O
dance O
like O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
was O
fit O
to O
be O
ambassadress O
at O
any O
court O
in O
Europe S-LOC
. O
He O
was O
only O
consoled O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
she O
was O
half S-CARDINAL
a O
French S-NORP
woman O
by O
birth O
. O
“ O
None O
but O
a O
compatriot O
, O
” O
his O
Excellency O
declared O
, O
“ O
could O
have O
performed O
that O
majestic O
dance O
in O
such O
a O
way O
. O
” O
Then O
she O
figured O
in O
a O
waltz O
with O
Monsieur B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Klingenspohr E-PERSON
, O
the B-PERSON
Prince I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Peterwaradin’s E-PERSON
cousin O
and O
attaché O
. O
The O
delighted O
Prince S-PERSON
, O
having O
less O
retenue O
than O
his O
French S-NORP
diplomatic O
colleague O
, O
insisted O
upon O
taking O
a O
turn O
with O
the O
charming O
creature O
, O
and O
twirled O
round O
the O
ball O
- O
room O
with O
her O
, O
scattering O
the O
diamonds O
out O
of O
his O
boot O
- O
tassels O
and O
hussar O
jacket O
until O
his O
highness O
was O
fairly O
out O
of O
breath O
. O
Papoosh B-PERSON
Pasha E-PERSON
himself O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
dance O
with O
her O
if O
that O
amusement O
had O
been O
the O
custom O
of O
his O
country O
. O
The O
company O
made O
a O
circle O
round O
her O
, O
and O
applauded O
as O
wildly O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
a O
Noblet S-PERSON
or O
a O
Taglioni S-PERSON
. O
Everybody O
was O
in O
ecstasy O

and O
Becky S-PERSON
too O
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
. O
She O
passed O
by O
Lady B-PERSON
Stunnington E-PERSON
with O
a O
look O
of O
scorn O
. O
She O
patronised O
Lady B-PERSON

her O
astonished O

mortified O
sister O

écraséd O

As O
for O
poor O
Mrs. O
Winkworth S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
long O
hair O
and O
great O
eyes O
, O
which O
had O
made O
such O
an O
effect O
at O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
evening O

where O
was O
she O
now O
? O
Nowhere O
in O
the O

She O
might O
tear O
her O
long O
hair O
and O
cry O
her O
great O
eyes O
out O

but O
there O
was O
not O
a O
person O
to O
heed O
or O
to O
deplore O
the O
discomfiture O
. O
The O
greatest O
triumph O
of O
all O
was O
at O
supper O

She O
was O
placed O
at O
the O
grand O

She O
was O
served O
on O
gold O

another O

Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
was O
scared O
at O
these O

They O
seemed O
to O
separate O
his O

farther O

ever O
from O
him O
somehow O

He O
thought O
with O
a O

how O
immeasurably O
she O
was O
his O

for O
which O
the O
people O
without O
bawled O

the O

caught O
up O
by O
the O

men O
who O
were O
stationed O
outside O

congratulating O
each O

hoping O
his O

Mrs. O

Rawdon S-PERSON
put O
his O

into O
the O

Mr. O

offered O
the O
Colonel O

They O
lighted O
their O

Rawdon S-PERSON

Two S-CARDINAL
persons O
separated O
from O
the O

followed O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O

when O
they O
had O
walked O
down O

one S-CARDINAL

up O

touching O
Rawdon S-PERSON

This O

Colonel O

That O
gallant O

at O
once O

befallen O
him O

He O
was O
in O
the O

His O

extended O
his O

to O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
: O
he O
pointed O
out O

necessity O

famously O
in O
English S-LANGUAGE

the O

all O
these O

disappeared O
before O
the O

His O

Henry B-PERSON

An O

so O

which O
all O
English S-LANGUAGE

Rawdon S-PERSON

when O
the O
Colonel O

express O
his O
sentimental O
sorrows O
at O
the O

The O
poor O

felt O
that O
his O
dearest O
pleasure O

closest O
friend O

taken O
from O

He O
looked O
often O

wistfully O
at O
the O
little O
vacant O
bed O
in O
his O
dressingroom O

where O
the O

used O

sleep O

He O
missed O
him O
sadly O

tried O
in O
vain O
to O
walk O
in O
the O

him O

He O
did O
not O

how O
solitary O
he O
was O
until O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON

gone O

He O
liked O
the O
people O

very O
fond O

her O

who O
wept O
copiously O

the O
time O

The O
elder O
Rawdon S-PERSON

The O
very O
best O

honestest O
feelings O

out O

these O
artless O

he O
indulged O

He O
secured O
not O

her O
sincere O
regard O

softness O

the O

kindly O

gentle O
nature O

not O

revolt O
at O
her O
sister’s O
callous O
behaviour O

It O
estranged O
Rawdon S-PERSON
from O
his O
wife O
more O
than O
he O
knew O

acknowledged O
to O
himself O

She O

not O
care O
for O
the O
estrangement O

Indeed O
, O
she O
did O
not O
miss O
him O

anybody O

She O
looked O
upon O
him O
as O
her O
errand O

man O
and O
humble O
slave O
. O
He O
might O
be O
ever O
so O
depressed O

sulky O

and O
she O
did O
not O
mark O
his O
demeanour O
, O
or O
only O
treated O
it O
with O
a O
sneer O

She O
was O
busy O
thinking O
about O
her O
position O
, O
or O
her O
pleasures O
, O
or O
her O
advancement O

It O
was O
honest O
Briggs S-PERSON

made O
up O
the O
little O
kit O
for O
the O

blubbered O
in O
the O
passage O
when O
he O
went O
away O
— O
Molly S-PERSON
kind O
and O
faithful O
in O
spite O
of O
a O
long O
arrear O
of O
unpaid O
wages O
. O
Mrs. O

could O
not O
let O

Let O
a O
cab O
be O
brought O

She O
did O
not O
offer O

kiss O
him O

he O
went O
: O
nor O
did O
the O
child O
propose O
to O
embrace O
her O

but O
gave O
a O
kiss O
to O
old O
Briggs S-PERSON
( O
whom O
, O
in O
general O
, O
he O
was O
very O
shy O
of O
caressing O
) O
, O
and O
consoled O
her O
by O
pointing O
out O
that O
he O
was O
to O
come O
home O
on O
Saturdays S-DATE
, O
when O
she O
would O
have O
the O
benefit O

seeing O
him O

As O
the O
cab O
rolled O
towards O
the O
City O
, O
Becky’s S-GPE
carriage O
rattled O
off O
to O
the O
Park S-FAC
. O
She O
was O
chattering O
and O
laughing O
with O
a O
score O
of O
young O
dandies O
by O
the O
Serpentine S-PERSON
, O
as O
the O
father O
and O
son O
entered O
at O
the O
old O
gates O
of O
the O
school O
— O
where O
Rawdon S-PERSON
left O
the O
child O
, O
and O
came O
away O
with O
a O
sadder O
, O
purer O
feeling O
in O
his O
heart O
than O
perhaps O
that O
poor O
battered O
fellow O
had O
ever O
known O
since O
he O
himself O
came O
out O
of O
the O
nursery O
. O
He O
walked O
all O
the O
way O
home O
very O
dismally O
, O
and O
dined O
alone O
with O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
very O
kind O
to O
her O
, O
and O
grateful O
for O
her O
love O
and O
watchfulness O
over O
the O
boy O
. O
His O
conscience O
smote O
him O
that O
he O
had O
borrowed O
Briggs’s S-PERSON
money O
and O
aided O
in O
deceiving O
her O
. O
They O
talked O
about O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
a O
long O
time O
, O
for O
Becky S-PERSON
only O
came O
home O
to O
dress O
and O
go O
out O
to O
dinner O
— O
and O
then O
he O
went O
off O
uneasily O
to O
drink O
tea O
with O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
and O
tell O
her O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
and O
how O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
went O
off O
like O
a O
trump O
, O
and O
how O
he O
was O
to O
wear O
a O
gown O
and O
little O
knee O
- O
breeches O
, O
and O
how O
young O
Blackball S-PERSON
, O
Jack B-PERSON
Blackball’s E-PERSON
son O
, O
of O
the O
old O
regiment O

had O
taken O
him O
in O

promised O
to O
be O
kind O
to O
him O

In O
the O
course O
of O
a O
week O
, O
young O
Blackball S-ORG
had O
constituted O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
his O
fag O

and O
breakfast O

initiated O
him O
into O
the O
mysteries O
of O
the O
Latin S-NORP
Grammar O

and O
thrashed O
him O
three S-CARDINAL

four S-CARDINAL
times O

but O
not O
severely O
. O
The O
little O
chap’s O
good O
- O
natured O
honest O
face O
won O
his O
way O
for O
him O

He O
only O
got O
that O
degree O
of O
beating O
which O
was O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
good O
for O
him O

as O
for O
blacking O

, O
toasting O
bread O

general O

necessary O
parts O

every O
young O
English S-LANGUAGE

Our O
business O

not O
lie O
with O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
generation O
and O
Master B-ORG
Rawdon’s E-ORG
life O
at O
school O
, O
otherwise O
the O
present O
tale O
might O
be O
carried O
to O
any O
indefinite O
length O

The O
Colonel O
went O
to O
see O
his O
son O
a O
short O
time O
afterwards O
, O
and O
found O
the O
lad O
sufficiently O
well O
and O
happy O
, O
grinning O
and O
laughing O
in O
his O
little O
black O
gown O
and O
little O
breeches O
. O
His O
father O
sagaciously O
tipped O
Blackball S-ORG
, O
his O
master O
, O
a O
sovereign O
, O
and O
secured O
that O
young O
gentleman’s O
good O
will O
towards O
his O
fag O

As O
a O
protégé O
of O
the O
great O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON

the O
nephew O
of O
a O
County O

son O
of O
a O
Colonel O

C.B. S-PERSON

whose O
name O
appeared O
in O
some O
of O
the O
most O
fashionable O
parties O
in O
the B-ORG
Morning I-ORG
Post E-ORG
, O
perhaps O
the O
school O
authorities O
were O
disposed O
not O
to O
look O
unkindly O
on O
the O
child O
. O
He O
had O
plenty O
of O
pocket O
- O
money O
, O
which O
he O
spent O
in O
treating O
his O
comrades O
royally O
to O
raspberry O
tarts O
, O
and O
he O
was O
often O
allowed O
to O
come O
home O
on O
Saturdays S-DATE
to O
his O
father O
, O
who O
always O
made O
a O
jubilee O
of O
that O
day O
. O
When O
free O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
would O
take O
him O
to O
the O
play O
, O
or O
send O
him O
thither O
with O
the O
footman O

and O
on O
Sundays S-DATE
he O
went O
to O
church O
with O
Briggs S-PERSON
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
and O
his O
cousins O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
marvelled O
over O
his O
stories O
about O
school O
, O
and O
fights O
, O
and O
fagging O
. O
Before O
long O
, O
he O
knew O
the O
names O
of O
all O
the O
masters O
and O
the O
principal O
boys O
as O
well O
as O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
himself O
. O
He O
invited O
little O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
crony O
from O
school O
, O
and O
made O
both O
the O
children O
sick O
with O
pastry O
, O
and O
oysters O
, O
and O
porter O
after O
the O
play O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
look O
knowing O
over O
the O
Latin S-NORP
grammar O
when O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
showed O
him O
what O
part O
of O
that O
work O
he O
was O
“ O
in O
. O
” O
“ O
Stick O
to O
it O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
” O
he O
said O
to O
him O
with O
much O
gravity O
, O
“ O
there’s O
nothing O
like O
a O
good O
classical O
education O
! O
nothing O
! O
” O
Becky’s S-PERSON
contempt O
for O
her O
husband O
grew O
greater O
every O
day O
. O
“ O
Do O
what O
you O
like O
, O
— O
dine O
where O
you O
please O
, O
— O
go O

have O
ginger O

sawdust O
at O
Astley’s O
, O
or O
psalm O

singing O
with O
Lady O

— O
only O
don’t O
expect O
me O
to O
busy O
myself O
with O
the O
boy O

I O
have O
your O
interests O
to O
attend O

as O
you O
can’t O
attend O
to O
them O

I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
where O
you O
would O
have O

now O

in O
what O

position O
in O

not O
looked O

” O
Indeed O
, O
nobody O
wanted O
poor O
old O
Rawdon S-PERSON
at O
the O
parties O
whither O
Becky S-PERSON
used O
to O
go O
. O
She O
was O
often O
asked O
without O
him O
now O

She O
talked O
about O
great O
people O
as O

when O
the O
Court S-ORG
went O
into O
mourning O

she O
always O
wore O
black O

Little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
being O
disposed O
of O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
who O
took O
such O
a O
parental O
interest O
in O
the O
affairs O
of O
this O
amiable O
poor O
family O
, O
thought O
that O
their O
expenses O
might O
be O
very O
advantageously O
curtailed O
by O
the O
departure O
of O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON

and O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
quite O
clever O
enough O
to O
take O
the O
management O
of O
her O
own O
house O
. O
It O
has O
been O
narrated O
in O
a O
former O
chapter O
, O
how O
the O
benevolent O
nobleman O
had O
given O
his O
protégé O
money O
to O
pay O
off O
her O
little O
debt O
to O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
who O
however O
still O
remained O
behind O
with O
her O
friends O
| | O
whence O
my O
lord O
came O
to O
the O
painful O
conclusion O
that O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
made O
some O
other O
use O
of O
the O
money O
confided O
to O
her O
than O
that O
for O
which O
her O
generous O
patron O
had O
given O
the O
loan O
. O
However O
, O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
was O
not O
so O
rude O
as O
to O
impart O
his O
suspicions O
upon O
this O
head O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
whose O
feelings O
might O
be O
hurt O
by O
any O
controversy O
on O
the O
money O
question O
, O
and O
who O
might O
have O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
painful O
reasons O
for O
disposing O
otherwise O
of O
his O
lordship’s O
generous O
loan O
. O
But O
he O
determined O
to O
satisfy O
himself O
of O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
: O
and O
instituted O
the O
necessary O
inquiries O
in O
a O
most O
cautious O
and O
delicate O
manner O
. O
In O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
he O
took O
an O
early O
opportunity O
of O
pumping O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
. O
That O
was O
not O
a O
difficult O
operation O
. O
A O
very O
little O
encouragement O
would O
set O
that O
worthy O
woman O
to O
talk O
volubly O
, O
and O
pour O
out O
all O
within O
her O
. O
And O
one O
day O
when O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
gone O
out O
to O
drive O
( O
as O
Mr. O

his O

confidential O
servant O

easily O
learned O

kept O
a O
carriage O

horses O
for O
Mr. O

Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
) O
— O
my O
lord O
dropped O
in O
upon O
the O
Curzon B-FAC
Street E-FAC
house O
— O
asked O
Briggs S-PERSON
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
— O
told O
her O
that O
he O
had O
good O
accounts O
of O
the O
little O
boy O
at O
school O
— O
and O
in O
five B-TIME
minutes E-TIME
found O
out O
from O
her O
that O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
nothing O
except O
a O
black O
silk O
gown O
, O
for O
which O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
was O
immensely O
grateful O
. O
He O
laughed O
within O
himself O
at O
this O
artless O
story O
. O
For O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
our O
dear O
friend O
Rebecca S-PERSON
had O
given O
him O
a O
most O
circumstantial O
narration O
of O
Briggs’s S-PERSON
delight O
at O
receiving O
her O
money O
— O
eleven B-QUANTITY

twenty I-QUANTITY

— O
and O
in O
what O
securities O
she O
had O
invested O
it O

and O
what O
a O
pang O
Becky S-PERSON
herself O
felt O
in O
being O
obliged O
to O
pay O
away O
such O
a O
delightful O
sum O
of O
money O
. O
“ O
Who O
knows O
, O
” O
the O
dear O
woman O
may O
have O
thought O
within O
herself O
, O
“ O
perhaps O
he O
may O
give O
me O
a O
little O
more O
? O
” O
My O
lord O
, O
however O
, O
made O
no O
such O
proposal O
to O
the O
little O
schemer O
— O
very O
likely O
thinking O
that O
he O
had O
been O
sufficiently O
generous O
already O
. O
He O
had O
the O
curiosity O
, O
then O
, O
to O
ask O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
about O
the O
state O
of O
her O
private O
affairs O
— O
and O
she O
told O
his O
lordship O
candidly O
what O
her O
position O
was O
— O
how O
Miss O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
left O
her O
a O
legacy O
— O
how O
her O
relatives O
had O
had O
part O
of O
it O
— O
how O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
had O
put O
out O
another O
portion O
, O
for O
which O
she O
had O
the O
best O
security O
and O
interest O
— O
and O
how O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
had O
kindly O
busied O
themselves O
with O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
to O
dispose O
of O
the O
remainder O
most O
advantageously O
for O
her O
, O
when O
he O
had O
time O
. O
My O
lord O
asked O
how O
much O
the O
Colonel O
had O
already O
invested O
for O
her O
, O
and O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
at O
once O
and O
truly O
told O
him O
that O
the O
sum O
was O
six B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
odd I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
. O
But O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
told O
her O
story O
, O
the O
voluble O
Briggs S-PERSON
repented O
of O
her O
frankness O
, O
and O
besought O
my O
lord O
not O
to O
tell O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
of O
the O
confessions O
which O
she O
had O
made O
. O
“ O
The O
Colonel O
was O
so O
kind O
— O
Mr. O
Crawley S-PERSON
might O
be O
offended O
and O
pay O
back O
the O
money O
, O
for O
which O
she O
could O
get O
no O
such O
good O
interest O
anywhere O
else O
. O
” O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
promised O
he O
never O
would O
divulge O
their O
conversation O
, O
and O
when O
he O
and O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON
parted O
he O
laughed O
still O
more O
. O
“ O
What O
an O
accomplished O
little O
devil O
it O
is O
! O
” O
thought O
he O
. O
“ O
What O
a O
splendid O
actress O
and O
manager O
! O
She O
had O
almost O
got O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
supply O
out O
of O
me O
the O
other O
day O
, O
with O
her O
coaxing O
ways O
. O
She O
beats O
all O
the O
women O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
the O
course O
of O
all O
my O
well O
- O
spent O
life O
. O
They O
are O
babies O
compared O
to O
her O
. O
I O
am O
a O
greenhorn O
myself O
, O
and O
a O
fool O
in O
her O
hands O
— O
an O
old O
fool O
. O
She O
is O
unsurpassable O
in O
lies O
. O
” O
His O
lordship’s O
admiration O
for O
Becky S-PERSON
rose O
immeasurably O
at O
this O
proof O
of O
her O
cleverness O
. O
Getting O
the O
money O
was O
nothing O
— O
but O
getting O
double O
the O
sum O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
paying O
nobody O
— O
it O
was O
a O
magnificent O
stroke O
. O
And O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
my O
lord O
thought O
— O
Crawley S-PERSON
is O
not O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
he O
looks O
and O
seems O
. O
He O
has O
managed O
the O
matter O
cleverly O
enough O
on O
his O
side O
. O
Nobody O
would O
ever O
have O
supposed O
from O
his O
face O
and O
demeanour O
that O
he O
knew O
anything O
about O
this O
money O
business O
| | O
and O
yet O
he O
put O
her O
up O
to O
it O
, O
and O
has O
spent O
the O
money O
, O
no O
doubt O
. O
In O
this O
opinion O
my O
lord O
, O
we O
know O
, O
was O
mistaken O
| | O
but O
it O
influenced O
a O
good O
deal O
his O
behaviour O
towards O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
began O
to O
treat O
with O
even O
less O
than O
the O
semblance O
of O
respect O
which O
he O
had O
formerly O
shown O
towards O
that O
gentleman O
. O
It O
never O
entered O
into O
the O
head O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
patron O
that O
the O
little O
lady O
might O
be O
making O
a O
purse O
for O
herself O
| | O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
if O
the O
truth O
must O
be O
told O
, O
he O
judged O
of O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
by O
his O
experience O
of O
other O
husbands O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
known O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
long O
and O
well O
- O
spent O
life O
which O
had O
made O
him O
acquainted O
with O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
the O
weakness O
of O
mankind O
. O
My O
lord O
had O
bought O
so O
many O
men O
during O
his O
life O
, O
that O
he O
was O
surely O
to O
be O
pardoned O
for O
supposing O
that O
he O
had O
found O
the O
price O
of O
this O
one O
. O
He O
taxed O
Becky S-PERSON
upon O
the O
point O
on O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
occasion O
when O
he O
met O
her O
alone O
, O
and O
he O
complimented O
her O
, O
good O
- O
humouredly O
, O
on O
her O
cleverness O
in O
getting O
more O
than O
the O
money O
which O
she O
required O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
only O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
. O
It O
was O
not O
the O
habit O
of O
this O
dear O
creature O
to O
tell O
falsehoods O
, O
except O
when O
necessity O
compelled O
, O
but O
in O
these O
great O
emergencies O
it O
was O
her O
practise O
to O
lie O
very O
freely O
| | O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
she O
was O
ready O
with O
another O
neat O
plausible O
circumstantial O
story O
which O
she O
administered O
to O
her O
patron O
. O
The O
previous O
statement O
which O
she O
had O
made O
to O
him O
was O
a O
falsehood O
— O
a O
wicked O
falsehood O
| | O
she O
owned O
it O
| | O
but O
who O
had O
made O
her O
tell O
it O
? O
“ O
Ah O
, O
my O
Lord O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
you O
don’t O
know O
all O
I O
have O
to O
suffer O
and O
bear O
in O
silence O
: O
you O
see O
me O
gay O
and O
happy O
before O
you O
— O
you O
little O
know O
what O
I O
have O
to O
endure O
when O
there O
is O
no O
protector O
near O
me O
. O
It O
was O
my O
husband O
, O
by O
threats O
and O
the O
most O
savage O
treatment O
, O
forced O
me O
to O
ask O
for O
that O
sum O
about O
which O
I O
deceived O
you O
. O
It O
was O
he O
, O
who O
, O
foreseeing O
that O
questions O
might O
be O
asked O
regarding O
the O
disposal O
of O
the O
money O
, O
forced O
me O
to O
account O
for O
it O
as O
I O
did O
. O
He O
took O
the O
money O
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
had O
paid O
Miss O
Briggs S-PERSON

I O
did O
not O
want O
, O
I O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
doubt O
him O
. O
Pardon O
the O
wrong O
which O
a O
desperate O
man O
is O
forced O
to O
commit O
, O
and O
pity O
a O
miserable O
, O
miserable O
woman O
. O
” O
She O
burst O
into O
tears O
as O
she O
spoke O
. O
Persecuted O
virtue O
never O
looked O
more O
bewitchingly O
wretched O
. O
They O
had O
a O
long O
conversation O
, O
driving O
round O
and O
round O
the B-FAC
Regent’s I-FAC
Park E-FAC
in O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
carriage O
together O
, O
a O
conversation O
of O
which O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
repeat O
the O
details O
: O
but O
the O
upshot O
of O
it O
was O
, O
that O
, O
when O
Becky S-PERSON
came O
home O
, O
she O
flew O
to O
her O
dear O
Briggs S-PERSON
with O
a O
smiling O
face O
, O
and O
announced O
that O
she O
had O
some O
very O
good O
news O
for O
her O
. O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
had O
acted O
in O
the O
noblest O
and O
most O
generous O
manner O
He O
was O
always O
thinking O
how O
and O
when O
he O
could O
do O
good O
. O
Now O
that O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
gone O
to O
school O
, O
a O
dear O
companion O
and O
friend O
was O
no O
longer O
necessary O
to O
her O
. O
She O
was O
grieved O
beyond O
measure O
to O
part O
with O
Briggs S-PERSON
| | O
but O
her O
means O
required O
that O
she O
should O
practise O
every O
retrenchment O
, O
and O
her O
sorrow O
was O
mitigated O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
her O
dear O
Briggs S-PERSON
would O
be O
far O
better O
provided O
for O
by O
her O
generous O
patron O
than O
in O
her O
humble O
home O
. O
Mrs. O
Pilkington S-PERSON
, O
the O
housekeeper O
at O
Gauntly B-FAC
Hall E-FAC
, O
was O
growing O
exceedingly O
old O
, O
feeble O
, O
and O
rheumatic O
: O
she O
was O
not O
equal O
to O
the O
work O
of O
superintending O
that O
vast O
mansion O
, O
and O
must O
be O
on O
the O
look O
- O
out O
for O
a O
successor O
. O
It O
was O
a O
splendid O
position O
. O
The O
family O
did O
not O
go O
to O
Gauntly S-GPE
once O
in O
two B-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
At O
other O
times O
the O
housekeeper O
was O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
magnificent O
mansion O
— O
had O
four S-CARDINAL
covers O
daily O
for O
her O
table O
| | O
was O
visited O
by O
the O
clergy O
and O
the O
most O
respectable O
people O
of O
the O
county O
— O
was O
the O
lady O
of O
Gauntly S-PERSON
, O
in O
fact O
| | O
and O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
last O
housekeepers O
before O
Mrs. O
Pilkington S-PERSON
had O
married O
rectors O
of O
Gauntly S-PERSON
: O
but O
Mrs. O
P. S-PERSON
could O
not O
, O
being O
the O
aunt O
of O
the O
present O
Rector O
. O
The O
place O
was O
not O
to O
be O
hers O
yet O
| | O
but O
she O
might O
go O
down O
on O
a O
visit O
to O
Mrs. O
Pilkington S-PERSON
, O
and O
see O
whether O
she O
would O
like O
to O
succeed O
her O
. O
What O
words O
can O
paint O
the O
ecstatic O
gratitude O
of O
Briggs S-PERSON
! O
All O
she O
stipulated O
for O
was O
that O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
come O
down O
and O
see O
her O
at O
the O
Hall S-FAC
. O
Becky S-PERSON
promised O
this O
— O
anything O
. O
She O
ran O
up O
to O
her O
husband O
when O
he O
came O
home O
, O
and O
told O
him O
the O
joyful O
news O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
glad O
, O
deuced O
glad O
| | O
the O
weight O
was O
off O
his O
conscience O
about O
poor O
Briggs’s S-PERSON
money O
. O
She O
was O
provided O
for O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
but O
— O
but O
his O
mind O
was O
disquiet O
. O
He O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
all O
right O
somehow O
. O
He O
told O
little O
Southdown S-ORG
what O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
had O
done O
, O
and O
the O
young O
man O
eyed O
Crawley S-PERSON
with O
an O
air O
which O
surprised O
the O
latter O
. O
He O
told O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
of O
this O
second S-ORDINAL
proof O
of O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
bounty O
, O
and O
she O
, O
too O
, O
looked O
odd O
and O
alarmed O
| | O
so O
did O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
. O
“ O
She O
is O
too O
clever O
and O
— O
and O
gay O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
go O
from O
party O
to O
party O
without O
a O
companion O
, O
” O
both O
said O
. O
“ O
You O
must O
go O
with O
her O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
wherever O
she O
goes O
, O
and O
you O
must O
have O
somebody O
with O
her O
— O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
girls O
from O
Queen’s B-GPE
Crawley E-GPE
, O
perhaps O
, O
though O
they O
were O
rather O
giddy O
guardians O
for O
her O
. O
” O
Somebody O
Becky S-PERSON
should O
have O
. O
But O
in O
the O
meantime O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
honest O
Briggs S-PERSON
must O
not O
lose O
her O
chance O
of O
settlement O
for O
life O
| | O
and O
so O
she O
and O
her O
bags O
were O
packed O
, O
and O
she O
set O
off O
on O
her O
journey O
. O
And O
so O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
out O
- O
sentinels O
were O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
enemy O
. O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
went O
and O
expostulated O
with O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
upon O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
dismissal O
of O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
and O
other O
matters O
of O
delicate O
family O
interest O
. O
In O
vain O
she O
pointed O
out O
to O
him O
how O
necessary O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
for O
her O
poor O
husband O
| | O
how O
cruel O
it O
would O
be O
on O
their O
part O
to O
deprive O
Briggs S-PERSON
of O
the O
position O
offered O
to O
her O
. O
Cajolements O
, O
coaxings O
, O
smiles O
, O
tears O
could O
not O
satisfy O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
had O
something O
very O
like O
a O
quarrel O
with O
his O
once O
admired O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
He O
spoke O
of O
the O
honour O
of O
the O
family O
: O
the O

already O

Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
though O
a O
nobleman O
of O
the O

was O
a O
man O

Becky S-PERSON

everything O

Lord O

came O
to O
her O
house O
as O
often O
as O
ever O
, O
and O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
anger O
increased O
. O
I O
wonder O
was O
Lady O

angry O
or O
pleased O
that O
her O
husband O
at O

Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
visits O
continuing O
, O
his O
own O
ceased O

his O

was O
for O
refusing O
all O
further O
intercourse O

that O

declining O
the O
invitation O

the O
Charade O

night O
which O
the O
Marchioness O
sent O
to O
her O

but O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
accept O
it O
, O
as O
his O
Royal O
Highness O
would O
be O
there O

Although O
he O
went O

Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
quitted O
it O
very O
early O

his O
wife O
, O
too O
, O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
come O
away O

Becky S-PERSON
hardly O
so O
much O
as O
spoke O
to O
him O
or O
noticed O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
declared O
her O
behaviour O
was O
monstrously O
indecorous O
, O
reprobated O
in O
strong O
terms O
the O
habit O
of O
play O
- O
acting O
and O
fancy O
dressing O
, O
as O
highly O
unbecoming O
a O
British S-NORP
female O
| | O
and O
after O
the O
charades O
were O
over O
, O
took O
his O
brother O
Rawdon S-PERSON
severely O
to O
task O
for O
appearing O
himself O
, O
and O
allowing O
his O
wife O
to O
join O
in O
such O
improper O
exhibitions O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
she O
should O
not O
join O
in O
any O
more O
such O
amusements O
: O
but O
indeed O
, O
and O
perhaps O
from O
hints O
from O
his O
elder O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
he O
had O
already O
become O
a O
very O
watchful O

exemplary O
domestic O
character O

He O
left O
off O

He O
never O
left O
home O

He O
took O
Becky S-PERSON
out O
to O
drive O
: O
he O
went O
laboriously O
with O
her O
to O
all O
her O
parties O
. O
Whenever O
my O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
called O
, O
he O
was O
sure O
to O
find O
the O
Colonel O
. O
And O
when O
Becky S-PERSON
proposed O
to O
go O
out O
without O
her O
husband O
, O
or O
received O
invitations O
for O
herself O
, O
he O
peremptorily O
ordered O
her O
to O
refuse O
them O

and O
there O
was O
that O
in O
the O
gentleman’s O
manner O
which O
enforced O
obedience O
. O
Little O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
to O
do O
her O
justice O
, O
was O
charmed O
with O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
gallantry O

If O
he O

surly O

she O
never O

Whether O

she O
had O
always O
a O
kind O
smile O
for O
him O

was O
attentive O
to O
his O
pleasure O

was O

“ O

and O
sell O
her O
trinkets O
to O
free O
him O
. O
She O
could O
laugh O
and O
talk O
about O
compliments O
paid O
to O
her O
, O
whilst O
he O
was O
in O
prison O
. O
Who O
had O
put O
him O
there O
? O
Wenham S-PERSON
had O
walked O
with O
him O
. O
Was O
there O
.… O
He O
could O
hardly O
bear O
to O
think O
of O
what O
he O
suspected O
. O
Leaving O
the O
room O
hurriedly O
, O
he O
ran O
into O
his O
own O
— O
opened O
his O
desk O
, O
wrote O
two S-CARDINAL
hurried O
lines O
, O
which O
he O
directed O
to O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
or O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
and O
bade O
the O
messenger O
carry O
them O
at O
once O
to O
Gaunt B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
bidding O
him O
to O
take O
a O
cab O
, O
and O
promising O
him O
a O
guinea O
if O
he O
was O
back O
in O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
In O
the O
note O
he O
besought O
his O
dear O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
God O

for O
the O
sake O
of O
his O
dear O
child O
and O
his O
honour O

to O
come O
to O
him O
and O
relieve O
him O
from O
his O
difficulty O
. O
He O
was O
in O
prison O
: O
he O
wanted O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
to O
set O
him O
free O
— O
he O
entreated O
them O
to O
come O
to O
him O
. O
He O
went O
back O
to O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
after O
dispatching O
his O
messenger O
, O
and O
called O
for O
more O
wine O
. O
He O
laughed O
and O
talked O
with O
a O
strange O
boisterousness O
, O
as O
the O
people O
thought O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
laughed O
madly O
at O
his O
own O
fears O
, O
and O
went O
on O
drinking O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
| | O
listening O
all O
the O
while O
for O
the O
carriage O
which O
was O
to O
bring O
his O
fate O
back O
. O
At O
the O
expiration O
of O
that O
time O
, O
wheels O
were O
heard O
whirling O
up O
to O
the O
gate O
— O
the O
young O
Janitor S-PERSON
went O
out O
with O
his O
gate O
- O
keys O
. O
It O
was O
a O
lady O
whom O
he O
let O
in O
at O
the O
bailiff’s O
door O
. O
“ O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
trembling O
very O
much O
. O
He O
, O
with O
a O
knowing O
look O
, O
locked O
the O
outer O
door O
upon O
her O
— O
then O
unlocked O
and O
opened O
the O
inner O
one O
, O
and O
calling O
out O
, O
“ O
Colonel O
, O
you’re O
wanted O
, O
” O
led O
her O
into O
the O
back O
parlour O
, O
which O
he O
occupied O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
came O
in O
from O
the O
dining O
- O
parlour O
where O
all O
those O
people O
were O
carousing O
, O
into O
his O
back O
room O
| | O
a O
flare O
of O
coarse O
light O
following O
him O
into O
the O
apartment O
where O
the O
lady O
stood O
, O
still O
very O
nervous O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
I O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
in O
a O
timid O
voice O
, O
which O
she O
strove O
to O
render O
cheerful O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
Jane S-PERSON
. O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
was O
quite O
overcome O
by O
that O
kind O
voice O
and O
presence O
. O
He O
ran O
up O
to O
her O
— O
caught O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
— O
gasped O
out O
some O
inarticulate O
words O
of O
thanks O
, O
and O
fairly O
sobbed O
on O
her O
shoulder O
. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
emotion O
. O
The O
bills O
of O
Mr. O
Moss S-PERSON
were O
quickly O
settled O
, O
perhaps O
to O
the O
disappointment O
of O
that O
gentleman O
, O
who O
had O
counted O
on O
having O
the O
Colonel O
as O
his O
guest O
over O
Sunday S-DATE
at O
least O
| | O
and O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
with O
beaming O
smiles O
and O
happiness O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
carried O
away O
Rawdon S-PERSON
from O
the O
bailiff’s O
house O
, O
and O
they O
went O
homewards O
in O
the O
cab O
in O
which O
she O
had O
hastened O
to O
his O
release O
. O
“ O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
gone O
to O
a O
parliamentary O
dinner O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
when O
Rawdons S-PERSON
note O
came O
, O
and O
so O
, O
dear O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
I O
— O
I O
came O
myself O
| | O
” O
and O
she O
put O
her O
kind O
hand O
in O
his O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
well O
for O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawly E-PERSON
that O
Pitt S-PERSON
was O
away O
at O
that O
dinner O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
thanked O
his O
sister O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
times O
, O
and O
with O
an O
ardor O
of O
gratitude O
which O
touched O
and O
almost O
alarmed O
that O
softhearted O
woman O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
in O
his O
rude O
, O
artless O
way O
, O
“ O
you O
— O
you O
don’t O
know O
how O
I’m O
changed O
since O
I’ve O
known O
you O
, O
and O
— O
and O
little O
Randy S-PERSON
. O
I O
— O
I’d O
like O
to O
change O
somehow O
. O
You O
see O
I O
want O
— O
I O
want O
— O
to O
be O
— O
” O
— O
He O
did O
not O
finish O
the O
sentence O
, O
but O
she O
could O
interpret O
it O
. O
And O
that O
night O
after O
he O
left O
her O
, O
and O
as O
she O
sate O
by O
her O
own O
little O
boy’s O
bed O
, O
she O
prayed O
humbly O
for O
that O
poor O
way O
worn O
sinner O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
left O
her O
and O
walked O
home O
rapidly O
. O
It O
was O
nine B-TIME
o’clock E-TIME
at O
night S-TIME
. O
He O
ran O
across O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
the O
great O
squares O
of O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
, O
and O
at O
length O
came O
up O
breathless O
opposite O
his O
own O
house O
. O
He O
started O
back O
and O
fell O
against O
the O
railings O
, O
trembling O
as O
he O
looked O
up O
. O
The O
drawing O
- O
room O
windows O
were O
blazing O
with O
light O
. O
She O
had O
said O
that O
she O
was O
in O
bed O
and O
ill O
. O
He O
stood O
there O
for O
some O
time O
, O
the O
light O
from O
the O
rooms O
on O
his O
pale O
face O
. O
He O
took O
out O
his O
door O
key O
and O
let O
himself O
into O
the O
house O
. O
He O
could O
hear O
laughter O
in O
the O
upper O
rooms O
. O
He O
was O
in O
the O
ball O
dress O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
captured O
the O
night O
before O
. O
He O
went O
silently O
up O
the O
stairs O
| | O
leaning O
against O
the O
banisters O
at O
the O
stair O
- O
head O
. O
— O
Nobody O
was O
stirring O
in O
the O
house O
besides O
— O
all O
the O
servants O
had O
been O
sent O
away O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
heard O
laughter O
within O
— O
laughter O
and O
singing O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
singing O
a O
snatch O
of O
the O
song O
of O
the O
night O
before O
| | O
a O
hoarse O
voice O
shouted O
“ O
Bravo B-WORK_OF_ART
! I-WORK_OF_ART
Bravo E-WORK_OF_ART
! O
” O
— O
it O
was O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
opened O
the O
door O
and O
went O
in O
. O
A O
little O
table O
with O
a O
dinner O
was O
laid O
out O
— O
and O
wine O
and O
plate O
. O
Steyne S-PERSON
was O
hanging O
over O
the O
sofa O
on O
which O
Becky S-PERSON
sate O
. O
The O
wretched O
woman O
was O
in O
a O
brilliant O
full O
toilette O
, O
her O
arms O
and O
all O
her O
fingers O
sparkling O
with O
bracelets O
and O
rings O
| | O
and O
the O
brilliants O
on O
her O
breast O
which O
Steyne S-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
. O
He O
had O
her O
hand O
in O
his O
, O
and O
was O
bowing O
over O
it O
to O
kiss O
it O
. O
when O
Becky S-PERSON
started O
up O
with O
a O
faint O
scream O
as O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
Rawdons S-PERSON
white O
face O
. O
At O
the O
next O
instant O
she O
tried O
a O
smile O
, O
a O
horrid O
smile O
, O
as O
if O
to O
welcome O
her O
husband O
: O
and O
Steyne S-PERSON
rose O
up O
, O
grinding O
his O
teeth O
, O
pale O
, O
and O
with O
fury O
in O
his O
looks O
. O
He O
, O
too O
, O
attempted O
a O
laugh O
— O
and O
came O
forward O
holding O
out O
his O
hand O
. O
“ O
What O
, O
come O
back O
! O
How O
d’ye O
do O
, O
Crawly O
? O
” O
he O
said O
, O
the O
nerves O
of O
his O
mouth O
twitching O
as O
he O
tried O
to O
grin O
at O
the O
intruder O
. O
There O
was O
that O
in O
Rawdons S-PERSON
face O
which O
caused O
Becky S-PERSON
to O
fling O
herself O
before O
him O
. O
“ O
I O
am O
innocent O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
said O
| | O
“ O
before O
God O
, O
I O
am O
innocent O
. O
” O
She O
clung O
hold O
of O
his O
coat O
, O
of O
his O
hands O
| | O
her O
own O
were O
all O
covered O
with O
serpents O
, O
and O
rings O
, O
and O
baubles O
. O
“ O
I O
am O
innocent O
. O
— O
Say O
I O
am O
innocent O
, O
” O
she O
said O
to O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
. O
He O
thought O
a O
trap O
had O
been O
laid O
for O
him O
, O
and O
was O
as O
furious O
with O
the O
wife O
as O
with O
the O
husband O
. O
“ O
You O
innocent O
! O
Damn O
you O
, O
” O
he O
screamed O
out O
. O
“ O
You O
innocent O
! O
Why O
every O
trinket O
you O
have O
on O
your O
body O
is O
paid O
for O
by O
me O
. O
I O
have O
given O
you O
thousands B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
pounds E-MONEY
which O
this O
fellow O
has O
spent O
, O
and O
for O
which O
he O
has O
sold O
you O
. O
Innocent O
, O
by O
— O
— O
! O
You’re O
as O
innocent O
as O
your O
mother O
, O
the O
ballet O
- O
girl O
, O
and O
your O
husband O
the O
bully O
. O
Don’t O
think O
to O
frighten O
me O
as O
you O
have O
done O
others O
. O
Make O
way O
, O
sir O
, O
and O
let O
me O
pass O
| | O
” O
and O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
seized O
up O
his O
hat O
, O
and O
, O
with O
flame O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
looking O
his O
enemy O
fiercely O
in O
the O
face O
, O
marched O
upon O
him O
, O
never O
for O
a O
moment O
doubting O
that O
the O
other O
would O
give O
way O
. O
But O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawly E-PERSON
springing O
out O
, O
seized O
him O
by O
the O
neckcloth O
, O
until O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
almost O
strangled O
, O
writhed O
, O
and O
bent O
under O
his O
arm O
. O
“ O
You O
lie O
, O
you O
dog O
! O
” O
said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
. O
“ O
You O
lie O
, O
you O
coward O
and O
villain O
! O
” O
And O
he O
struck O
the O
Peer O
twice O
over O
the O
face O
with O
his O
open O
hand O
, O
and O
flung O
him O
bleeding O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
It O
was O
all O
done O
before O
Rebecca S-PERSON
could O
interpose O
. O
She O
stood O
there O
trembling O
before O
him O
. O
She O
admired O
her O
husband O
, O
strong O
, O
brave O
, O
and O
victorious O
. O
“ O
Come O
here O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
— O
She O
came O
up O
at O
once O
. O
“ O
Take O
off O
those O
things O
. O
” O
— O
She O
began O
, O
trembling O
, O
pulling O
the O
jewels O
from O
her O
arms O
, O
and O
the O
rings O
from O
her O
shaking O
fingers O
, O
and O
held O
them O
all O
in O
a O
heap O
, O
quivering O
and O
looking O
up O
at O
him O
. O
“ O
Throw O
them O
down O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
and O
she O
dropped O
them O
. O
He O
tore O
the O
diamond O
ornament O
out O
of O
her O
breast O
and O
flung O
it O
at O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
. O
It O
cut O
him O
on O
his O
bald O
forehead O
. O
Steyne S-PERSON
wore O
the O
scar O
to O
his O
dying O
day O
. O
“ O
Come O
upstairs O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
wife O
. O
“ O
Don’t O
kill O
me O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
He O
laughed O
savagely O
. O
— O
“ O
I O
want O
to O
see O
if O

to O
great O
inconvenience O
. O
I O
don’t O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
I O
won’t O
assist O
you O
ultimately O
. O
But O
as O
for O
paying O
your O
creditors O
in O
full O
, O
I O
might O
as O
well O
hope O
to O
pay O
the O
National O
Debt O
. O
It O
is O
madness O
, O
sheer O
madness O
, O
to O
think O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
. O
You O
must O
come O
to O
a O
compromise O
. O
It’s O
a O
painful O
thing O
for O
the O
family O
| | O
but O
everybody O
does O
it O
. O
There O
was O
George B-PERSON
Kitely E-PERSON
, O
Lord O
Ragland’s S-PERSON
son O
, O
went O
through O
the O
Court S-ORG
last B-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
and O
was O
what O
they O
call O
white O
- O
washed O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
Lord O
Ragland S-PERSON
would O
not O
pay O
a O
shilling O
for O
him O
, O
and O
— O
— O
” O
“ O
It’s O
not O
money O
I O
want O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
broke O
in O
. O
“ O
I’m O
not O
come O
to O
you O
about O
myself O
. O
Never O
mind O
what O
happens O
to O
me O
— O
— O
” O
“ O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
, O
then O
? O
” O
said O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
somewhat O
relieved O
. O
“ O
It’s O
the O
boy O
, O
” O
said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
husky O
voice O
. O
“ O
I O
want O
you O
to O
promise O
me O
that O
you O
will O
take O
charge O
of O
him O
when O
I’m O
gone O
. O
That O
dear O
good O
wife O
of O
yours O
has O
always O
been O
good O
to O
him O
| | O
and O
he’s O
fonder O
of O
her O
than O
he O
is O
of O
his O
… O
— O
Damn O
it O
. O
Look O
here O
, O
Pitt S-PERSON
— O
you O
know O
that O
I O
was O
to O
have O
had O
Miss O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
money O
. O
I O
wasn’t O
brought O
up O
like O
a O
younger O
brother O
: O
but O
was O
always O
encouraged O
to O
be O
extravagant O
and O
kep O
idle O
. O
But O
for O
this O
I O
might O
have O
been O
quite O
a O
different O
man O
. O
I O
didn’t O
do O
my O
duty O
with O
the O
regiment O
so O
bad O
. O
You O
know O
how O
I O
was O
thrown O
over O
about O
the O
money O
, O
and O
who O
got O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
After O
the O
sacrifices O
I O
have O
made O
, O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
I O
have O
stood O
by O
you O
, O
I O
think O
this O
sort O
of O
reproach O
is O
useless O
, O
” O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
Your O
marriage O
was O
your O
own O
doing O
, O
not O
mine O
. O
” O
“ O
That’s O
over O
now O
, O
” O
said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
. O
— O
“ O
That’s O
over O
now O
. O
” O
And O
the O
words O
were O
wrenched O
from O
him O
with O
a O
groan O
, O
which O
made O
his O
brother O
start O
. O
“ O
Good O
God O
! O
is O
she O
dead O
? O
” O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O
voice O
of O
genuine O
alarm O
and O
commiseration O
. O
“ O
I O
wish O
I O
was O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
replied O
. O
“ O
If O
it O
wasn’t O
for O
little O
Rawdon B-PERSON
I’d E-PERSON
have O
cut O
my O
throat O
this O
morning O
— O
and O
that O
damned O
villain’s O
too O
. O
” O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
instantly O
guessed O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
surmised O
that O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
was O
the O
person O
whose O
life O
Rawdon S-PERSON
wished O
to O
take O
. O
The O
Colonel O
told O
his O
senior O
briefly O
, O
and O
in O
broken O
accents O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
. O
“ O
It O
was O
a O
regular O
plan O
between O
that O
scoundrel O
and O
her O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
The O
bailiffs O
were O
put O
upon O
me O
: O
I O
was O
taken O
as O
I O
was O
going O
out O
of O
his O
house O
: O
when O
I O
wrote O
to O
her O
for O
money O
, O
she O
said O
she O
was O
ill O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
put O
me O
off O
to O
another O
day O
. O
And O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
found O
her O
in O
diamonds O
and O
sitting O
with O
that O
villain O
alone O
. O
” O
He O
then O
went O
on O
to O
describe O
hurriedly O
the O
personal O
conflict O
with O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
. O
To O
an O
affair O
of O
that O
nature O
, O
of O
course O
, O
he O
said O
, O
there O
was O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
issue O
| | O
and O
after O
his O
conference O
with O
his O
brother O
, O
he O
was O
going O
away O
to O
make O
the O
necessary O
arrangements O
for O
the O
meeting O
which O
must O
ensue O
. O
“ O
And O
as O
it O
may O
end O
fatally O
with O
me O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
with O
a O
broken O
voice O
, O
“ O
and O
as O
the O
boy O
has O
no O
mother O
, O
I O
must O
leave O
him O
to O
you O
and O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
Pitt S-PERSON
— O
only O
it O
will O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
me O
if O
you O
will O
promise O
me O
to O
be O
his O
friend O
. O
” O
The O
elder O
brother O
was O
much O
affected O
, O
and O
shook O
Rawdons S-PERSON
hand O
with O
a O
cordiality O
seldom O
exhibited O
by O
him O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
passed O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
shaggy O
eyebrows O
. O
“ O
Thank O
you O
, O
brother O
, O
” O
said O
he O
. O
“ O
I O
know O
I O
can O
trust O
your O
word O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
will O
, O
upon O
my O
honour O
, O
” O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
said O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
and O
almost O
mutely O
, O
this O
bargain O
was O
struck O
between O
them O
. O
Then O
Rawdon S-PERSON
took O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
the O
little O
pocketbook O
which O
he O
had O
discovered O
in O
Becky’s S-GPE
desk O
: O
and O
from O
which O
he O
drew O
a O
bundle O
of O
notes O
which O
it O
contained O
. O
“ O
Here’s O
six O
hundred O
, O
” O
he O
said O
— O
“ O
you O
didn’t O
know O
I O
was O
so O
rich O
. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
give O
the O
money O
to O
Briggs S-PERSON
, O
who O
lent O
it O
to O
us O
— O
and O
who O
was O
kind O
to O
the O
boy O
— O
and O
I’ve S-PERSON
always O
felt O
ashamed O
of O
having O
taken O
the O
poor O
old O
woman’s O
money O
. O
And O
here’s O
some O
more O
— O
I’ve O
only O
kept O
back O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
pounds E-QUANTITY
— O
which O
Becky S-PERSON
may O
as O
well O
have O
, O
to O
get O
on O
with O
. O
” O
As O
he O
spoke O
he O
took O
hold O
of O
the O
other O
notes O
to O
give O
to O
his O
brother O
, O
but O
his O
hands O
shook O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
agitated O
that O
the O
pocket O
- O
book O
fell O
from O
him O
, O
and O
out O
of O
it O
the B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
note O
which O
had O
been O
the O
last O
of O
the O
unlucky O
Becky’s S-PRODUCT
winnings O
. O
Pitt S-PERSON
stooped O
and O
picked O
them O
up O
, O
amazed O
at O
so O
much O
wealth O
. O
“ O
Not O
that O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
— O
“ O
I O
hoped O
to O
put O
a O
bullet O
into O
the O
man O
whom O
that O
belongs O
to O
. O
” O
He O
had O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fine O
revenge O
to O
wrap O
a O
ball O
in O
the O
note O
, O
and O
kill O
Steyne S-PERSON
with O
it O
. O
After O
this O
colloquy O
the O
brothers O
once O
more O
shook O
hands O
and O
parted O
. O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
had O
heard O
of O
the O
Colonel’s S-PERSON
arrival O
and O
was O
waiting O
for O
her O
husband O
in O
the O
adjoining O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
with O
female O
instinct O
, O
auguring O
evil O
. O
The O
door O
of O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
happened O
to O
be O
left O
open O
, O
and O
the O
lady O
of O
course O
was O
issuing O
from O
it O
as O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
brothers O
passed O
out O
of O
the O
study O
. O
She O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
to O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
and O
said O
she O
was O
glad O
he O
was O
come O
to O
breakfast O
| | O
though O
she O
could O
perceive O
, O
by O
his O
haggard O
unshorn O
face O
, O
and O
the O
dark O
looks O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
that O
there O
was O
very O
little O
question O
of O
breakfast O
between O
them O
. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
muttered O
some O
excuses O
about O
an O
engagement O
, O
squeezing O
hard O
the O
timid O
little O
hand O
which O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
reached O
out O
to O
him O
. O
Her O
imploring O
eyes O
could O
read O
nothing O
but O
calamity O
in O
his O
face O
| | O
but O
he O
went O
away O
without O
another O
word O
. O
Nor O
did O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
vouchsafe O
her O
any O
explanation O
. O
The O
children O
came O
up O
to O
salute O
him O
, O
and O
he O
kissed O
them O
in O
his O
usual O
frigid O
manner O
. O
The O
mother O
took O
both O
of O
them O
close O
to O
herself O
, O
and O
held O
a O
hand O
of O
each O
of O
them O
as O
they O
knelt O
down O
to O
prayers O
, O
which O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
read O
to O
them O
, O
and O
to O
the O
servants O
in O
their O
Sunday S-DATE
suits O
or O
liveries O
, O
ranged O
upon O
chairs O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
hissing O
tea-urn O
. O
Breakfast O
was O
so O
late O
that O
day O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
the O
delays O
which O
had O
occurred O
, O
that O
the O
church O
- O
bells O
began O
to O
ring O
whilst O
they O
were O
sitting O
over O
their O
meal O
: O
and O
Lady O
Jane S-PERSON
was O
too O
ill O
, O
she O
said O
, O
to O
go O
church O
, O
though O
her O
thoughts O
had O
been O
entirely O
astray O
during O
the O
period O
of O
family O
devotion O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawly E-PERSON
meanwhile O
hurried O
on O
from O
Great B-FAC
Gaunt I-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
and O
knocking O
at O
the O
great O
bronze O
Medusa’s O
head O
which O
stands O
on O
the O
portal O
of O
Gaunt B-FAC
House E-FAC
, O
brought O
out O
the O
purple O
Silenus S-PRODUCT
in O
a O
red O
and O
silver O
waistcoat O
, O
who O
acts O
as O
porter O
of O
that O
palace O
. O
The O
man O
was O
scared O
also O
by O
the O
Colonel’s S-PERSON
dishevelled O
appearance O
, O
and O
barred O
the O
way O
as O
if O
afraid O
that O
the O
other O
was O
going O
to O
force O
it O
. O
But O
Colonel O
Crawly S-PERSON
only O
took O
out O
a O
card O
and O
enjoined O
him O
particularly O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
, O
and O
to O
mark O
the O
address O
written O
on O
it O
, O
and O
say O
that O
Colonel O
Crawly S-PERSON
would O
be O
all O
day O
after O
one B-TIME
o’clock E-TIME
at O
the B-FAC
Regent I-FAC
Club E-FAC
in O
St. B-FAC
James’s I-FAC
Street E-FAC
— O
not O
at O
home O
. O
The O
fat O
red-faced O
man O
looked O
after O
him O
with O
astonishment O
as O
he O
strode O
away O
| | O
so O
did O
the O
people O
in O
their O
Sunday S-DATE
clothes O
who O
were O
out O
so O
early O

the O
charity O
boys O
with O
shining O
faces O
, O
the O
greengrocer O
lolling O
at O
his O
door O
, O
and O
the O
publican O
shutting O
his O
shutters O
in O
the O
sunshine O
, O
against O
service O
commenced O
. O
The O
people O
joked O
at O
the O
cab O
- O
stand O
about O
his O
appearance O
, O
as O
he O
took O
a O
carriage O
there O
, O
and O
told O
the O
driver O
to O
drive O
him O
to O
Knightsbridge B-FAC
Barracks E-FAC
. O
All O
the O
bells O
were O
jangling O
and O
tolling O
as O
he O
reached O
that O
place O
. O
He O
might O
have O
seen O
his O
old O
acquaintance O
Amelia S-PERSON
on O
her O
way O
from O
Brompton S-GPE
to O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
had O
he O
been O
looking O
out O
. O
Troops O
of O
schools O
were O
on O
their O
march O
to O
church O
, O
the O
shiny O
pavement O
and O
outsides O
of O
coaches O
in O
the O
suburbs O
were O
thronged O
with O
people O
out O
upon O
their O
Sunday S-DATE
pleasure O

but O
the O
Colonel O
was O
much O
too O
busy O
to O
take O
any O
heed O
of O
these O
phenomena O
, O
and O
, O
arriving O
at O
Knightsbridge S-GPE
, O

the O

he O
was O
the O
common O
refuge O

“ O
What’s O
the O
row O
about O

“ O
No O

” O
“ O
It’s O
about O

about O
my O

Crawly O
answered O
, O
casting O
down O
his O
eyes O

turning O
very O
red O
. O
The O
other O
gave O
a O
whistle O

“ O
I O
always O
said O
she’d O
throw O
you O

he O
began O
: O
— O
indeed O
there O
were O
bets O
in O
the O

at O
the O
clubs O
regarding O
the O
probable O
fate O
of O
Colonel B-PERSON

, O
so O
lightly O
was O
his O
wife’s O
character O
esteemed O
by O
his O
comrades O

the O
world O

but O
seeing O
the O
savage O
look O
with O
which O
Rawdon S-PERSON
answered O
the O
expression O
of O
this O
opinion O
, O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
did O
not O
think O
fit O
to O
enlarge O
upon O
it O
further O
. O
“ O
Is O
there O
no O
way O
out O
of O
it O
, O
old O

” O
the O
Captain O
continued O
in O
a O
grave O
tone O

“ O
Is O
it O
only O

it O

” O
“ O
Think O
of O
his O
only O
finding O
her O
out O
now O
, O
” O
the O
Captain O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
remembered O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
particular O
conversations O
at O
the O
mess O
- O
table O
, O
in O
which O
Mrs. O
Crawley’s S-PERSON
reputation O
had O
been O
torn O
to O
shreds O
. O
“ O
There’s O
no O
way O
but O
one O
out O
of O
it O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
replied O
— O
“ O
and O
there’s O
only O
a O
way O
out O
of O
it O
for O
one O
of O
us O
, O
Mac S-PERSON
— O
do O
you O
understand O
? O
I O
was O
put O
out O
of O
the O

: O
arrested O
: O
I O
found O
’em O
alone O
together O

I O
told O
him O
he O
was O
a O
liar O

a O
coward O

knocked O
him O
down O

thrashed O
him O

” O
“ O
Serve O
him O
right O
, O
” O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
Who O
is O
it O
? O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
answered O
it O
was O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
. O
“ O
The O
deuce O
! O
a O
Marquis S-PERSON
! O
they O

“ O
What O
the O
devil O
do O
you O

? O
” O
roared O
out O
Rawdon S-PERSON

“ O
do O
you O
mean O
that O
you O
ever O
heard O
a O
fellow O

didn’t O

” O
“ O
The O
world’s O
very O
censorious O
, O
old O
boy O

” O
the O
other O
replied O

“ O
What O
the O

was O
the O
good O
of O

” O
“ O
It O
was O
damned O
unfriendly O
, O
Mac S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
quite O
overcome O

and O
, O
covering O
his O
face O
with O
his O
hands O
, O
he O
gave O
way O
to O
an O
emotion O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
which O
caused O
the O
tough O
old O
campaigner O
opposite O
him O
to O
wince O
with O
sympathy O
. O
“ O
Hold O
up O
, O
old O
boy O

” O
he O
said O

“ O
great O
man O

not O
, O
we’ll O
put O
a O
bullet O
in O
him O

damn O
him O

As O
for O
women O
, O
they’re O
all O
so O

” O
“ O
You O
don’t O
know O
how O
fond O
I O
was O
of O
that O
one O
, O
” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
said O
, O
half O
inarticulately O
. O
“ O
Damme S-PERSON
, O
I O
followed O
her O
like O
a O
footman O

I O
gave O
up O
everything O
I O
had O
to O
her O

I’m O
a O

I O

By O
Jove S-PERSON

Sir O

I’ve S-PERSON

making O
a O

all O

grudged O
me O
a B-QUANTITY

get O
me O
out O
of O

” O
He O
then O
fiercely O
and O
incoherently O
, O
and O
with O
an O
agitation O
under O
which O
his O
counsellor O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
him O
labour O
, O
told O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
story O
. O
His O
adviser O
caught O
at O
some O
stray O
hints O
in O
it O
. O
“ O
She O
may O
be O
innocent O
, O
after O
all O

” O
“ O
It O
may O
be O
so O

” O
Rawdon S-PERSON
answered O
sadly O

“ O
but O
this O
don’t O
look O
very O
innocent O

” O
and O
he O
showed O
the O
Captain O
the O
thousand B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
pound E-QUANTITY
note O
which O
he O
had O
found O
in O
Becky’s O

“ O

” O
The O
Captain O
could O
not O

own O
that O
the O
secreting O
of O
the O

a O
very O
ugly O

Whilst O
they O
were O
engaged O
in O
their O
conference O
, O
Rawdon S-PERSON
dispatched O
Captain B-PERSON

servant O
to O
Curzon B-FAC

an O
order O
to O

stood O
them O
in O
much O

Rawdon S-PERSON

his O
second S-ORDINAL

a O

the O

was O
to O
send O
to O
Lord O

Captain O
Macmurdo S-PERSON

the O
honour O

on O
the O

it O
was O
his O

intention O
to O
demand O

which O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O

Captain O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
begged O
Lord O

in O
the O
most O

In O
a O

the O
Captain O
stated O
that O

note O
for O
a O
large O

Colonel O

the O
property O

“ O

Sir O

the O
astonished O
Baronet S-PERSON

even O
laid O

greatly O
surprised O

only O
guilty O

have O
received O

you O

poured O

It O
was O
he O

young O
Cornet S-PERSON

now O
so O
knowing O
a O
hand O
in O
Cribb’s O
parlour O

had O
a O
still O
lingering O
liking O
for O
toffy O

used O
to O
be O
birched O
at O
Eton S-ORG

So O
they O
went O
on O
talking O
about O
dancers O

fights O

drinking O
, O
demireps O

until O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
came O
down O

joined O
the O
boys O

the O
conversation O

Old O
Mac S-PERSON

famous O
for O
his O
good O

He O
was O
not O
exactly O
a O
lady’s O
man O

that O
is O

men O
asked O
him O
to O
dine O
rather O
at O
the O
houses O
of O
their O
mistresses O

of O

mothers O

There O
can O
scarcely O
be O
a O
life O
lower O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
his O

he O
was O
quite O
contented O
with O
it O

such O
as O
it O
was O

led O
it O
in O
perfect O

modesty O

By O

it’s O
of O
no O
consequence O
, O
and O
I O
pledge O
you O
my O
word O
to O
the O
fact O
. O
If O
we O
had O
come O
— O
and O
it O
was O
only O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
Mrs. O
Wenham’s S-PERSON
headaches O
which O
prevented O
us O
— O
she O
suffers O
under O
them O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
spring O
— O
if O
we O
had O
come O
, O
and O
you O
had O
returned O
home O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
no O
quarrel O
, O
no O
insult O
, O
no O
suspicion O
— O
and O
so O
it O
is O
positively O
because O
my O
poor O
wife O
has O
a O
headache O
that O
you O
are O
to O
bring O
death O
down O
upon O
two S-CARDINAL
men O
of O
honour O
, O
and O
plunge O
two S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
excellent O
and O
ancient O
families O
in O
the O
kingdom O
into O
disgrace O
and O
sorrow O
. O
” O
Mr. O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
looked O
at O
his O
principal O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
man O
profoundly O
puzzled O
: O
and O
Rawdon S-PERSON
felt O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
rage O
that O
his O
prey O
was O
escaping O
him O
. O
He O
did O
not O
believe O
a O
word O
of O
the O
story O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
how O
discredit O
or O
disprove O
it O
? O
Mr. O
Wenham S-PERSON
continued O
with O
the O
same O
fluent O
oratory O
, O
which O
in O
his O
place O
in O
parliament O
he O
had O
so O
often O
practised O
— O
“ O
I O
sate O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
or O
more O
by O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
bedside O
, O
beseeching O
, O
imploring O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
to O
forego O
his O
intention O
of O
demanding O
a O
meeting O
. O
I O
pointed O
out O
to O
him O
that O
the O
circumstances O
were O
after O
all O
suspicious O
— O
they O
were O
suspicious O
. O
I O
acknowledge O
it O
, O
— O
any O
man O
in O
your O
position O
might O
have O
been O
taken O
in O
— O
I O
said O
that O
a O
man O
furious O
with O
jealousy O
is O
to O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
a O
madman O
, O
and O
should O
be O
as O
such O
regarded O
— O
that O
a O
duel O
between O
you O
must O
lead O
to O
the O
disgrace O
of O
all O
parties O
concerned O
— O
that O
a O
man O
of O
his O
Lordship’s O
exalted O
station O
had O
no O
right O
in O
these O
days O
, O
when O
the O
most O
atrocious O
revolutionary O
principles O
, O
and O
the O
most O
dangerous O
levelling O
doctrines O
are O
preached O
among O
the O
vulgar O
, O
to O
create O
a O
public O
scandal O

and O
that O
, O
however O
innocent O
, O
the O
common O
people O
would O
insist O
that O
he O
was O
guilty O
. O
In O
fine O
, O
I O
implored O
him O
not O
to O
send O
the O
challenge O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
don’t O
believe O
one O
word O
of O

whole O
story O

said O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
grinding O
his O
teeth O
. O
“ O
I O
believe O
it O

come O

” O
Mr. O
Wenham S-PERSON
turned O
deadly O
pale O
at O
this O
savage O
interruption O
of O
the O
Colonel O
, O
and O
looked O
towards O
the O
door O
. O
But O
he O
found O
a O
champion O
in O
Captain O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
. O
That O
gentleman O
rose O
up O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
and O
rebuked O
Rawdon S-PERSON
for O
his O
language O
. O
“ O
You O
put O
the O
affair O
into O

, O
Mr. O

as O
for O

with O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
my O
belief O
is O
, O
there’s O
nothing O
proved O
at O
all O
: O
that O
your O
wife’s O
innocent O
, O
as O
innocent O
as O
Mr. O
Wenham S-PERSON
says O
she O
is O
: O
and O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
that O
you O
would O
be O
a O
d— O
fool O

tongue O

“ O
Captain O

like O
a O
man O

sense O

Mr. O
Wenham S-PERSON
cried O
out O
, O
immensely O
relieved O
— O
“ O
I O
forget O
any O

Mr. O

took O
his O
hat O

upon O
this O
, O

Captain O

following O
him O
to O
the O
door O

shut O

Rawdon S-PERSON
chafing O

When O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
were O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
looked O
hard O
at O
the O
other O
ambassador O

with O
an O
expression O
of O
anything O

respect O
on O
his O
round O
jolly O
face O

“ O

said O
. O
“ O
You O
flatter O

answered O
the O

with O
a O
smile O
. O
“ O
Upon O
my O
honour O

innocence O

was O
bowed O
down O
the O
Club O
steps O
by O
Captain O
Macmurdo S-PERSON

just O
as O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON

ascended O
them O

a O
slight O
acquaintance O

Captain O

the O
Baronet S-PERSON

the O
room O
where O
the O
latter’s O
brother O
was O

told O
Sir O

in O
confidence O

that O

had O
made O
the O
affair O
all O
right O
between O

Colonel O

was O
well O
pleased O

of O
course O

at O
this O
intelligence O

congratulated O
his O
brother O
warmly O
upon O
the O
peaceful O
issue O
of O
the O
affair O
, O
making O
appropriate O
moral O
remarks O
upon O
the O
evils O

the O
unsatisfactory O
nature O

that O
sort O
of O
settlement O

disputes O

And O
after O
this O
preface O
, O
he O
tried O
with O
all O
his O
eloquence O
to O
effect O
a O
reconciliation O
between O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O

He O
recapitulated O
the O
statements O
which O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
made O
, O
pointed O
out O
the O
probabilities O
of O
their O
truth O

asserted O
his O

firm O
belief O

innocence O

Rawdon S-PERSON
would O
not O
hear O

it O

sank O
down O
on O
his O
chest O

spoke O
the O
words O

broken O

sad O

“ O
Poor O
old O
boy O

” O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
said O
, O
shaking O
his O
head O

Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
resisted O
for O
some O
time O
the O
idea O
of O
taking O
the O
place O
which O
had O
been O
procured O
for O
him O
by O
so O
odious O

was O
also O
for O
removing O
the O
boy O
from O
the O
school O
where O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
interest O
had O
placed O
him O
. O
He O
was O
induced O
, O
however O
, O
to O
acquiesce O
in O
these O
benefits O
by O
the O
entreaties O
of O
his O
brother O
and O
Macmurdo S-PERSON
: O
but O
mainly O
by O
the O
latter O
pointing O
out O
to O
him O
what O
a O
fury O
Steyne S-PERSON
would O
be O
in O
, O
to O
think O
that O
his O
enemy’s O
fortune O

abroad O

up O

congratulated O

Service S-ORG

made O

a O
degree O

The O
secret O

— O
a O
Baronet S-PERSON

perhaps O

The O

— O
none O

— O
no O
, O
no O
. O
A O
few O
years O
before O
, O
he O
used O
to O
be O
savage O

inveigh O
against O
all O
parsons O

declaring O

a O
pack O

quacks O

that O
weren’t O

by O
grinding O
Latin S-LANGUAGE

Greek S-LANGUAGE
, O
and O
a O
set O
of O
supercilious O
dogs O
, O
that O
pretended O
to O
look O
down O
upon O
British S-NORP
merchants O

, O
who O
could O
buy O
up O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
of O
’em O
. O
He O
would O
mourn O
now O
, O
in O
a O
very O
solemn O
manner O
, O
that O
his O
own O
education O

repeatedly O
point O
out O

When O
they O
met O
at O
dinner O
the O
grandsire O
used O

ask O
the O
lad O
what O
he O
had O
been O
reading O
during O
the O
day O
, O

was O
greatly O
interested O
at O
the O
report O

boy O
gave O
of O

studies O

pretending O
to O
understand O
little O
George S-PERSON
when O
he O
spoke O
regarding O
them O
. O
He O
made O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
blunders O
, O
and O
showed O
his O
ignorance O
many O
a O
time O
. O
It O
did O
not O
increase O
the O
respect O
which O
the O
child O
had O
for O
his O
senior O
. O
A O
quick O
brain O
and O
a O
better O
education O
elsewhere O
showed O
the O
boy O
very O
soon O
that O
his O
grandsire O
was O
a O
dullard O

and O
he O
began O
accordingly O
to O
command O
him O
and O
to O
look O
down O
upon O
him O

for O
his O
previous O
education O
, O
humble O
and O
contracted O
as O
it O
had O
been O
, O
had O
made O
a O
much O
better O
gentleman O
of O
Georgy S-PERSON
than O
any O
plans O
of O
his O
grandfather O
could O
make O
him O
. O
He O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
by O
a O
kind O
, O
weak O
, O
and O
tender O
woman O
, O
who O
had O
no O
pride O
about O
anything O

but O
about O
him O
, O
and O
whose O
heart O
was O
so O
pure O
and O
whose O
bearing O
was O
so O
meek O
and O
humble O
, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
but O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
true O
lady O
. O
She O
busied O
herself O
in O
gentle O
offices O

quiet O
duties O

if O
she O
never O
said O

unkind O
ones O

guileless O

artless O

indeed O
how O
could O
our O
poor O
little O
Amelia S-PERSON
be O
other O
than O
a O
real O
gentle O
- O
woman O
! O
Young O
Georgy S-PERSON
lorded O
over O
this O
soft O
and O
yielding O
nature O
: O
and O
the O
contrast O
of O
its O
simplicity O
and O
delicacy O
with O
the O
coarse O
pomposity O
of O
the O
dull O
old O
man O
with O
whom O
he O
next O
came O
in O
contact O
, O
made O
him O
lord O
over O
the O
latter O
too O
. O
If O
he O
had O
been O
a O
Prince O
Royal O
he O
could O
not O
have O
been O
better O
brought O
up O
to O
think O
well O
of O
himself O
. O
Whilst O
his O
mother O
was O
yearning O
after O
him O
at O
home O
, O
and O
I O
do O
believe O
every O
hour O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
during O
most O
hours O
of O
the O
sad O
lonely O
nights O
, O
thinking O
of O
him O
, O
this O
young O
gentleman O
had O
a O
number O
of O
pleasures O
and O
consolations O
administered O
to O
him O
, O
which O
made O
him O
for O
his O
part O
bear O
the O
separation O
from O
Amelia S-PERSON
very O
easily O
. O
Little O

It O

only O
a O
very O
few O

weep O
from O
sheer O

When O
you O

the O

your O

dried O

of O
a O
piece O
of O
gingerbread O

that O
a O
plum O

a O
look O
of O
triumph O
in O
his O

, O
he O
pulled O
a O

out O
of O

( O

pulled O
out O

red O

gave O

a O
little O
cry O

, O
seized O
the O
boy O

embraced O
him O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
times O

was O
a O

may O

His O

had O
wished O
to O
have O
a O
picture O
of O
him O
by O
an O
artist O

works O
, O
exhibited O
in O
a O
shop O
- O
window O
, O
in O
Southampton B-GPE

, O
had O
caught O
the O
old O
gentleman’s O
eyes O

and O
George S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
plenty O
of O
money O
, O
bethought O
him O
of O
asking O
the O
painter O
how O
much O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
little O
portrait O
would O
cost O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
would O
pay O
for O
it O
out O
of O
his O
own O
money O
, O
and O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
give O
it O
to O
his O
mother O
. O
The O
pleased O
painter O
executed O
it O
for O
a O
small O
price O

and O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
himself O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
of O
the O
incident O
, O
growled O
out O
his O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
gave O
the O
boy O
twice O
as O
many O
sovereigns O
as O
he O
paid O
for O
the O
miniature O
. O
But O
what O
was O
the O
grandfather’s O
pleasure O
compared O
to O
Amelia’s O
ecstasy O
? O
That O
proof O
of O
the O
boy’s O
affection O
charmed O
her O
so O
, O
that O
she O
thought O
no O
child O
in O
the O
world O
was O
like O
hers O
for O
goodness O
. O
For O
long O
weeks O
after O
, O
the O
thought O
of O
his O
love O
made O
her O
happy O
. O
She O
slept O
better O
with O
the O
picture O
under O
her O
pillow O
| | O
and O
how O
many O
many O
times O
did O
she O
kiss O
it O
, O
and O
weep O
and O
pray O
over O
it O
! O
A O
small O
kindness O
from O
those O
she O
loved O
made O
that O
timid O
heart O
grateful O
. O
Since O
her O
parting O
with O
George S-PERSON
she O
had O
had O
no O
such O
joy O
and O
consolation O

At O
his O
new O
home O
Master B-PERSON

ruled O

invited O

drink O
wine O

the O

coolness O

took O
off O
his O

in O
a O
way O
which O
charmed O
his O
old O
grandfather O
. O
“ O
Look O
at O
him O
, O
” O
the O
old O
man O
would O
say O

nudging O
his O

with O
a O
delighted O
purple O
face O

“ O

whenever O

he O
took O

the O

thinking O

If O

failed O
at O
the B-TIME

Todd S-PERSON
was O
asked O
to O
dine O
. O
Mrs. O
Todd S-PERSON
and O
Maria S-PERSON
came O
across O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
slipped O
in O
with O
a O
muffled O
knock O
, O
and O
were O
in O
the O
drawing O

room O
by O
the O
time O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
the O
ladies O
under O
her O
convoy O
reached O
that O
apartment O

ready O
to O
fire O
off O
duets O

sing O
until O
the O
gentlemen O
came O
up O
. O
Poor O
Maria B-PERSON
Todd E-PERSON

poor O
young O
lady O
! O
How O
she O
had O
to O
work O
and O
thrum O
at O
these O
duets O
and O
sonatas O
in O
the O
Street O
, O
before O
they O
appeared O
in O
public O
in O
the O
Square O
! O
Thus O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
decreed O
by O
fate O
, O
that O
Georgy S-PERSON
was O
to O
domineer O
over O
everybody O
with O
whom O
he O
came O
in O
contact O
, O
and O
that O
friends O
, O
relatives O
, O
and O
domestics O
were O
all O
to O
bow O
the O
knee O
before O
the O
little O
fellow O
. O
It O
must O
be O
owned O
that O
he O
accommodated O
himself O
very O
willingly O
to O
this O
arrangement O
. O
Most O
people O
do O
so O
. O
And O
Georgy S-PERSON
liked O
to O
play O
the O
part O
of O
master O
, O
and O
perhaps O
had O
a O
natural O
aptitude O
for O
it O
. O
In O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
everybody O
was O
afraid O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
and O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
afraid O
of O
Georgy S-PERSON

The O
boy’s O
dashing O
manners O
, O
and O
offhand O
rattle O
about O

dead O
unreconciled O
in O
Brussels S-GPE
yonder O
) O
, O
awed O
the O
old O
gentleman O
, O
and O
gave O
the O
young O
boy O
the O
mastery O
. O
The O
old O
man O
would O
start O
at O
some O
hereditary O
feature O
or O
tone O
unconsciously O
used O
by O
the O
little O
lad O
, O
and O
fancy O
that O
George’s S-PERSON
father O
was O
again O
before O
him O
. O
He O
tried O
by O
indulgence O
to O
the O
grandson O
to O
make O
up O
for O
harshness O
to O
the O
elder O
George S-PERSON
. O
People O
were O
surprised O
at O
his O
gentleness O
to O
the O
boy O
. O
He O
growled O
and O
swore O
at O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
as O
usual O
: O
and O
would O
smile O
when O
George S-PERSON
came O
down O
late O
for O
breakfast O
. O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
George’s S-PERSON

It O
was O
easy O
for O
a O
lad O
of O
spirit O
to O
master O
her O
. O
And O
whenever O
George S-PERSON
wanted O
anything O

from O

down O

Very O
true O

think O
how O
mysterious O

it O
is O

that O

Directly O

understood O
it O

her O

in O
the O

of O
all O
these O
solitary O
resignations O

not O

I O
believe O

at O
Bicêtre S-GPE

near O
Paris S-GPE

a O
poor O
wretch O
bent O
down O
under O
the O
bondage O

his O
imprisonment O

his O
personal O
infirmity O

to O

one S-CARDINAL

The O
kindness O
was O
too O
much O
for O
the O
poor O
epileptic O
creature O

He O
cried O
in O
an O
anguish O

so O

buried O

upon O
just O
such O
a O
rainy O
, O
dark O
day O
, O
as O
Amelia S-PERSON
recollected O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
she O
had O
been O
there O
to O
marry O
George S-PERSON
. O
Her O
little O
boy O
sate O
by O
her O
side O
in O
pompous O
new O
sables O
. O
She O
remembered O
the O
old O
pew- O
woman O
and O
clerk O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
away O
in O
other O
times O
as O
the O
parson O
read O
. O
But O
that O
she O
held O
George’s S-PERSON
hand O
in O
her O
own O
, O
perhaps O
she O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
change O
places O
with O
… O
Then O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
she O
felt O
ashamed O
of O
her O
selfish O
thoughts O
, O
and O
prayed O
inwardly O
to O
be O
strengthened O
to O
do O
her O
duty O
. O
So O
she O
determined O
with O
all O
her O
might O
and O
strength O
to O
try O
and O
make O
her O
old O
father O
happy O
. O
She O
slaved O
, O
toiled O
, O
patched O
, O
and O
mended O
, O
sang O
and O
played O
backgammon O
, O
read O
out O
the O
newspaper O
, O
cooked O
dishes O
, O
for O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
walked O
him O
out O
sedulously O
into O
Kensington B-FAC
Gardens E-FAC
or O
the B-FAC
Brompton I-FAC
Lanes E-FAC
, O
listened O
to O
his O
stories O
with O
untiring O
smiles O
and O
affectionate O
hypocrisy O
, O
or O
sate O
musing O
by O
his O
side O
and O
communing O
with O
her O
own O
thoughts O
and O
reminiscences O
, O
as O
the O
old O
man O
, O
feeble O
and O
querulous O
, O
sunned O
himself O
on O
the O
garden O
benches O
and O
prattled O
about O
his O
wrongs O
or O
his O
sorrows O
. O
What O
sad O
, O
unsatisfactory O
thoughts O
those O
of O
the O
widow O
were O
! O
The O
children O
running O
up O
and O
down O
the O
slopes O
and O
broad O
paths O
in O
the O
gardens O
, O
reminded O
her O
of O
George S-PERSON
who O
was O
taken O
from O
her O
: O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
George S-PERSON
was O
taken O
from O
her O
: O
her O
selfish O
, O
guilty O
love O
, O
in O
both O
instances O
, O
had O
been O
rebuked O
and O
bitterly O
chastised O
. O
She O
strove O
to O
think O
it O
was O
right O
that O
she O
should O
be O
so O
punished O
. O
She O
was O
such O
a O
miserable O
wicked O
sinner O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
alone O
in O
the O
world O
. O
I O
know O
that O
the O
account O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
solitary O
imprisonment O
is O
insufferably O
tedious O
, O
unless O
there O
is O
some O
cheerful O
or O
humorous O
incident O
to O
enliven O
it O
, O

his O

But O
we O

Perhaps O
the O
ingenious O
reader O
has O
guessed O
who O
was O
the O
stout O
gentleman O
who O
called O
upon O
Georgy S-PERSON
at O
his O
school O
in O
company O
with O
our O
old O
friend O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
another O
old O
acquaintance O
returned O
to O
England S-GPE
, O
and O
at O
a O
time O
when O
his O
presence O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
of O
great O
comfort O
to O
his O
relatives O
there O
. O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
having O
easily O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
leave O
from O
his O
good O
- O
natured O
commandant O
to O
proceed O
to O
Madras S-GPE
, O
and O
thence O
probably O
to O
Europe S-LOC
, O
on O
urgent O
private O
affairs O
, O
never O
ceased O
travelling O
night O
and O
day O
until O
he O
reached O
his O
journey’s O
end O
, O
and O
had O
directed O
his O
march O
with O
such O
celerity O
, O
that O
he O
arrived O
at O
Madras S-GPE
in O
a O
high O
fever O
. O
His O
servants O
who O
accompanied O
him O
, O
brought O
him O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
friend O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
resolved O
to O
stay O
until O
his O
departure O
for O
Europe S-LOC
in O
a O
state O
of O
delirium O
: O
and O
it O
was O
thought O
for O
many O
, O
many O
days O
that O
he O
would O
never O
travel O
farther O
than O
the O
burying O

ground O
of O
the O
church O
of O
St. B-GPE
George’s E-GPE

where O
the O
troops O
should O
fire O
a O
salvo O
over O
his O
grave O

where O
many O
a O
gallant O
officer O
lies O
far O
away O
from O
his O
home O

Here O
, O
as O
the O
poor O
fellow O
lay O
tossing O
in O
his O
fever O
, O
the O
people O
who O
watched O
him O
might O
have O
heard O
him O
raving O
about O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
The O
idea O
that O
he O
should O
never O
see O
her O
again O
depressed O
him O
in O
his O
lucid O
hours O
. O
He O
thought O
his O
last O
day O
was O
come O

and O
he O
made O
his O
solemn O
preparations O
for O
departure O
: O
setting O
his O
affairs O
in O
this O
world O

order O

leaving O
the O
little O
property O

he O
was O
possessed O
to O
those O
whom O
he O
most O
desired O
to O
benefit O

The O
friend O
in O
whose O
house O
he O
was O
located O
witnessed O
his O
testament O
. O
He O
desired O
to O
be O
buried O
with O
a O
little O
brown O
hair O
- O
chain O
which O
he O
wore O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
which O
, O
if O
the O
truth O
must O
be O
known O
, O
he O
had O
got O
from O
Amelia’s S-NORP
maid O
at O
Brussels S-GPE
, O
when O
the O
young O
widow’s O
hair O
was O
cut O
off O
, O
during O
the O
fever O
which O
prostrated O
her O
after O

death O
of O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
on O
the O
plateau O
at O
Mount B-FAC
St. I-FAC

He O
recovered O
, O
rallied O

relapsed O
again O

having O
undergone O
such O
a O
process O
of O
blood O
- O
letting O
and O
calomel O
as O
showed O
the O
strength O
of O
his O
original O
constitution O

He O
was O
almost O
a O
skeleton O
when O
they O
put O
him O
on O
board O
the B-FAC
Ramchunder I-FAC
East I-FAC
Indiaman E-FAC
, O
Captain O
Bragg S-PERSON
, O
from O
Calcutta S-GPE
, O
touching O
at O
Madras S-GPE

and O
so O
weak O
and O
prostrate O
, O
that O
his O
friend O
who O
had O
tended O
him O
through O
his O
illness O
, O
prophesied O
that O
the O
honest O
Major O
would O
never O
survive O
the O
voyage O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
pass O
some O
morning O
, O
shrouded O
in O
flag O
and O
hammock O
, O
over O
the O
ship’s O
side O
, O
and O
carrying O
down O
to O
the O
sea O
with O
him O
the O
relic O
that O
he O
wore O
at O
his O
heart O

But O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
sea O
air O
, O
or O
the O
hope O
which O
sprung O
up O
in O
him O
afresh O
, O
from O
the O
day O
that O
the O
ship O
spread O
her O
canvas O
and O
stood O
out O
of O
the O
roads O
towards O
home O
, O
our O
friend O
began O
to O
amend O
, O
and O
he O
was O
quite O
well O
( O
though O
as O
gaunt O
as O
a O
greyhound O
) O
before O
they O
reached O
the O
Cape S-LOC
. O
“ O
Kirk S-PERSON
will O
be O
disappointed O
of O
his O
majority O
this O
time O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
: O
“ O
he O
will O
expect O
to O
find O
himself O
gazetted O
by O
the O
time O
the O
regiment O
reaches O
home O

” O
For O
it O
must O
be O
premised O
that O
while O
the O
Major O
was O
lying O
ill O
at O
Madras S-GPE
, O
having O
made O
such O
prodigious O
haste O

go O

the O
gallant O

after O
its O

been O
baulked O
of O
its O
stay O

the O
Waterloo S-GPE
campaign O

had O
been O
ordered O
from O

India S-GPE

had O
received O
orders O
home O

the O
Major O
might O
have O
accompanied O
his O
comrades O
had O
he O
chosen O
to O
wait O
for O
their O
arrival O
at O
Madras S-GPE
. O
Perhaps O
he O
was O
not O
inclined O
to O
put O
himself O
in O
his O
exhausted O
state O
again O
under O
the O
guardianship O
of O
Glorvina S-PERSON

“ O
I O
think O
Miss O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
would O
have O
done O
for O
me O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
laughingly O
, O
to O
a O
fellow O
- O
passenger O
, O
“ O
if O
we O

it O

also O
a O

served O
his O
full O
time O

had O
fine O

enabled O
him O

lay O
by O

considerable O
sum O

he O
had O
brought O
a O
stock O
of O
novels O
and O
plays O
which O
he O
lent O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
rendered O
himself O
agreeable O
to O
all O
by O
his O
kindness O
and O
condescension O
. O
Many O
and O
many O
a O
night O
as O
the O
ship O
was O
cutting O
through O
the O
roaring O
dark O
sea O
, O
the O
moon O
and O
stars O
shining O
overhead O
, O
and O
the O
bell O
singing O
out O
the O
watch O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
and O
the O
Major O
would O
sit O
on O
the O
quarter O
- O
deck O
of O
the O
vessel O
talking O
about O
home O
, O
as O
the O
Major O
smoked O
his O
cheroot O
, O
and O
the O
civilian O
puffed O
at O
the O
hookah O
which O
his O
servant O
prepared O
for O
him O
. O
In O
these O
conversations O
it O
was O
wonderful O
with O
what O
perseverance O
and O
ingenuity O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
would O
manage O
to O
bring O
the O
talk O
round O
to O
the O
subject O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
her O
little O
boy O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
a O
little O
testy O
about O
his O
father’s O
misfortunes O
and O
unceremonious O
applications O
to O
him O
, O
was O
soothed O
down O
by O
the O
Major O
, O
who O
pointed O
out O
the O
elder’s O
ill O
fortunes O
and O
old O
age O
. O
He O
would O
not O
perhaps O
like O
to O
live O
with O
the O
old O
couple O
: O
whose O
ways O
and O
hours O
might O
not O
agree O
with O
those O
of O
a O
younger O
man O
, O
accustomed O
to O
different O
society O
, O
( O
Jos S-PERSON
bowed O
at O
this O
compliment O
) O
: O
but O
, O
the O
Major O
pointed O
out O
, O
how O
advantageous O
it O
would O
be O
for O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
to O
have O
a O
house O
of O
his O
own O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
and O
not O
a O
mere O
bachelor’s O
establishment O
as O
before O
: O
how O
his O
sister O
Amelia S-PERSON
would O
be O
the O
very O
person O
to O
preside O
over O
it O
| | O
how O
elegant O
, O
how O
gentle O
she O
was O
, O
and O
of O
what O
refined O
good O
manners O
. O
He O
recounted O
stories O
of O
the O
success O
which O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
had O
had O
in O
former O
days S-DATE
at O
Brussels S-GPE
, O
and O
in O
London S-GPE
, O
where O
she O
was O
much O
admired O
by O
people O
of O
very O
great O
fashion O
: O
and O
he O
then O
hinted O
how O
becoming O
it O
would O
be O
for O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
send O
Georgy S-PERSON
to O
a O
good O
school O
and O
make O
a O
man O
of O
him O
| | O
for O
his O
mother O
and O
her O
parents O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
spoil O
him O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
this O
artful O
Major O
made O
the O
civilian O
promise O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
her O
unprotected O
child O
. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
as O
yet O
what O
events O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
little O
Sedley S-PERSON
family O
: O
and O
how O
death O
had O
removed O
the O
mother O
, O
and O
riches O
had O
carried O
off O
George S-PERSON
from O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
But O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
every O
day O
and O
always O
, O
this O
love O
- O
smitten O
and O
middle O
- O
aged O
gentleman O
was O
thinking O
about O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
whole O
heart O
was O
bent O
upon O
doing O
her O
good O
. O
He O
coaxed O
, O
wheedled O
, O
cajoled O
, O
and O
complimented O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
with O
a O
perseverance O
and O
cordiality O
of O
which O
he O
was O
not O
aware O
himself O
, O
very O
likely O
| | O
but O
some O
men O
who O
have O
unmarried O
sisters O
or O
daughters O
even O
, O
may O
remember O
how O
uncommonly O
agreeable O
gentlemen O
are O
to O
the O
male O
relations O
when O
they O
are O
courting O
the O
females O
| | O
and O
perhaps O
this O
rogue O
of O
a O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
urged O
by O
a O
similar O
hypocrisy O
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
when O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
came O
on O
board O
the O
Ramchunder S-PERSON
, O
very O
sick O
, O
and O
for O
the B-DATE
three I-DATE
days E-DATE
she O
lay O
in O
the B-LOC
Madras I-LOC
Roads E-LOC
, O
he O
did O
not O
begin O
to O
rally O
, O
nor O
did O
even O
the O
appearance O
and O
recognition O
of O
his O
old O
acquaintance O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
on O
board O
much O
cheer O
him O
, O
until O
after O
a O
conversation O
which O
they O
had O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
as O
the O
Major O
was O
laid O
languidly O
on O
the O
deck O
. O
He O
said O
then O
he O
thought O
he O
was O
doomed O
| | O
he O
had O
left O
a O
little O
something O
to O
his O
godson O
in O
his O
will O
| | O
and O
he O
trusted O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
would O
remember O
him O
kindly O
, O
and O
be O
happy O
in O
the O
marriage O
she O
was O
about O
to O
make O
. O
“ O
Married O
? O
not O
the O
least O
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
answered O
: O
“ O
he O
had O
heard O
from O
her O
: O
she O
made O
no O
mention O
of O
the O
marriage O
, O
and O
by O
the O
way O
, O
it O
was O
curious O
, O
she O
wrote O
to O
say O
that O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
going O
to O
be O
married O
, O
and O
hoped O
that O
he O
would O
be O
happy O
. O
” O
What O
were O
the O
dates O
of O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
letters O
from O
Europe S-LOC
? O
The O
civilian O
fetched O
them O
. O
They O
were O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
later E-DATE
than O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
| | O
and O
the O
ship’s O
surgeon O
congratulated O
himself O
upon O
the O
treatment O
adopted O
by O
him O
towards O
his O
new O
patient O
, O
who O
had O
been O
consigned O
to O
ship O
- O
board O
by O
the O
Madras S-GPE
practitioner O
with O
very O
small O
hopes O
indeed O
| | O
for O
, O
from O
that O
day O
, O
the O
very O
day O
that O
he O
changed O
the O
draught O
, O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
began O
to O
mend O
. O
And O
thus O
it O
was O
that O
deserving O
officer O
, O
Captain O
Kirk S-PERSON
, O
was O
disappointed O
of O
his O
majority O
. O
After O
they O
passed O
St. B-GPE
Helena E-GPE
, O
Major O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
gaiety O
and O
strength O
was O
such O
as O
to O
astonish O
all O
his O
fellow O
- O
passengers O
. O
He O
larked O
with O
the O
midshipmen O
, O
played O
single O
- O
stick O
with O
the O
mates O
, O
ran O
up O
the O
shrouds O
like O
a O
boy O
, O
sang O
a O
comic O
song O
one O
night O
to O
the O
amusement O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
assembled O
over O
their O
grog O
after O
supper O
, O
and O
rendered O
himself O
so O
gay O
, O
lively O
, O
and O
amiable O
, O
that O
even O
Captain O
Bragg S-PERSON
, O
who O
thought O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
his O
passenger O
, O
and O
considered O
he O
was O
a O
poor O
- O
spirited O
feller O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
was O
constrained O
to O
own O
that O
the O
Major O
was O
a O
reserved O
but O
well O
- O
informed O
and O
meritorious O
officer O
. O
“ O
He O
ain’t O
got O
distangy O
manners O
, O
dammy O
, O
” O
Bragg S-PERSON
observed O
to O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
mate O

“ O
he O
wouldn’t O
do O
at O
Government B-ORG
House E-ORG
, O
Roper S-PERSON
, O
where O
his O
Lordship O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
William E-PERSON
was O
as O
kind O
to O
me O
, O
and O
shook O
hands O
with O
me O
before O
the O
whole O
company O
, O
and O
asking O
me O
at O
dinner O
to O
take O
beer O
with O
him O

before O
the O
Commander O

Chief O

he O
ain’t O
got O
manners O
, O
but O
there’s O
something O
about O
him O
— O
” O
And O
thus O
Captain O
Bragg S-PERSON
showed O
that O
he O
possessed O
discrimination O
as O
a O
man O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ability O
as O
a O
commander O
. O
But O
a O
calm O
taking O
place O
when O
the O
Ramchunder S-PERSON
was O
within O
ten S-CARDINAL
days’ O
sail O
of O
England S-GPE
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
became O
so O
impatient O
and O
ill O
- O
humoured O
as O
to O
surprise O
those O
comrades O
who O
had O
before O
admired O
his O
vivacity O
and O
good O
temper O
. O
He O
did O
not O
recover O
until O
the O
breeze O
sprang O
up O
again O
, O
and O
was O
in O
a O
highly O
excited O
state O
when O
the O
pilot O
came O
on O
board O

Good O
God O
, O
how O
his O
heart O
beat O
as O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
friendly O
spires O
of O
Southampton S-GPE
came O
in O
sight O

XXIII O

Our O
Friend O

rendered O
himself O
so O
popular O
on O
board O
the O
Ramchunder S-FAC

that O
when O
he O
and O
Mr. O

descended O
into O
the O
welcome O
shore O

officers O

the O
great O
Captain B-PERSON
Bragg E-PERSON
himself O
leading O
off O

gave O
three S-CARDINAL
cheers O
for O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
blushed O
very O
much O
, O
and O
ducked O
his O
head O
in O
token O
of O
thanks O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
who O
very O
likely O
thought O
the O
cheers O
were O
for O
himself O

took O
off O
his O
gold O

laced O
cap O

waved O
it O
majestically O
to O
his O

they O
were O
pulled O
to O
shore O

landed O
with O
great O
dignity O
at O
the O

they O
proceeded O

that O
a O

entering O
such O

English S-LANGUAGE
inn O

might O
well O
like O
to O
stop O
some O
days O
there O
, O
yet O
Dobbin S-PERSON
began O
to O
talk O
about O
a O
post O

chaise O
instantly O
, O
and O
was O
no O
sooner O
at O
Southampton S-GPE
than O
he O
wished O
to O
be O
on O
the O
road O
to O
London S-GPE

Jos S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
moving O
that B-TIME

Why O
was O
he O
to O
pass O
a O
night O
in O
a O
post O
- O
chaise O
instead O
of O
a O
great O
large O
undulating O
downy O
feather O
bed O
which O
was O
there O
ready O
to O
replace O
the O
horrid O
little O
narrow O
crib O
in O
which O
the O
portly O
Bengal S-NORP
gentleman O
had O
been O
confined O
during O
the O

He O
could O
not O

his O
baggage O
was O
cleared O

or O
of O
travelling O
until O
he O
could O
do O
so O
with O
his O

So O
the O
Major O
was O
forced O
to O
wait O
over O
that O
night O
, O
and O
despatched O
a O
letter O

Mr. O

take O
off O
his O
first S-ORDINAL

If O
I O

time O

I O
would O

Ah O
, O
how O
good O
it O

just O

his O
wont O
. O
Indeed O
, O
it O
was O
so O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
that O
nobody O
was O
up O
in O
the O
house O
except O
that O
wonderful O
Boots O
of O
an O
inn O
who O
never O
seems O
to O
want O
sleep O
: O
and O
the O
Major O
could O
hear O
the O
snores O
of O
the O
various O
inmates O
of O
the O
house O
roaring O
through O
the O
corridors O
as O
he O
creaked O
about O
in O
those O
dim O
passages O
. O
Then O
the O
sleepless O
Boots O
went O
shirking O
round O
from O
door O
to O
door O
, O
gathering O
up O
at O
each O
the O
Bluchers S-FAC
, O
Wellingtons S-PRODUCT
, O
Oxonians S-PRODUCT
, O
which O
stood O
outside O
. O
Then O
Jos’s S-PERSON
native O
servant O
arose O
and O
began O
to O
get O
ready O
his O
master’s O
ponderous O
dressing O
apparatus O
, O
and O
prepare O
his O
hookah O
: O
then O
the O
maid O
servants O
got O
up O
, O
and O
meeting O
the O
dark O
man O
in O
the O
passages O
, O
shrieked O
, O
and O
mistook O
him O
for O
the O
devil O
. O
He O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
stumbled O
over O
their O
pails O
in O
the O
passages O
as O
they O
were O
scouring O
the O
decks O
of O
the B-FAC
Royal I-FAC
George E-FAC
. O
When O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
unshorn O
waiter O
appeared O
and O
unbarred O
the O
door O
of O
the O
inn O
, O
the O
Major O
thought O
that O
the O
time O
for O
departure O
was O
arrived O
, O
and O
ordered O
a O
post O
- O
chaise O
to O
be O
fetched O
instantly O
, O
that O
they O
might O
set O
off O
. O
He O
then O
directed O
his O
steps O
to O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
room O
, O
and O
opened O
the O
curtains O
of O
the O
great O
large O
family O
bed O
wherein O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
snoring O
. O
“ O
Come O
, O
up O
! O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
” O
the O
Major O
said O
, O
“ O
it’s O
time O
to O
be O
off O

the O
chaise O
will O
be O
at O
the O
door O
in O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
. O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
growled O
from O
under O
the O
counterpane O
to O
know O
what O
the O
time O
was O
| | O
but O
when O
he O
at O
last O
extorted O
from O
the O
blushing O
Major O
( O
who O
never O
told O
fibs O
, O
however O
they O
might O
be O
to O
his O
advantage O
) O
what O
was O
the B-TIME
real I-TIME
hour I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
, O
he O
broke O
out O
into O
a O
volley O
of O
bad O
language O
, O
which O
we O
will O
not O
repeat O
here O
, O
but O
by O
which O
he O
gave O
Dobbin S-PERSON
to O
understand O
that O
he O
would O
jeopardy O
his O
soul O
if O
he O
got O
up O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
that O
the O
Major O
might O
go O
and O
be O
hanged O
, O
that O
he O
would O
not O
travel O
with O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
unkind O
and O
ungentlemanlike O
to O
disturb O
a O
man O
out O
of O
his O
sleep O
in O
that O
way O
| | O
on O
which O
the O
discomfited O
Major O
was O
obliged O
to O
retreat O
, O
leaving O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
resume O
his O
interrupted O
slumbers O
. O
The O
chaise O
came O
up O
presently O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
would O
wait O
no O
longer O
. O
If O
he O
had O
been O
an O
English S-LANGUAGE
nobleman O
travelling O
on O
a O
pleasure O

despatches O
( O
government O
messages O
are O
generally O
carried O
much O
more O
quietly O
) O
, O
he O
could O
not O
have O
travelled O
more O
quickly O
. O
The O
post O
- O
boys O
wondered O
at O
the O
fees O
he O
flung O
amongst O
them O
. O
How O
happy O
and O
green O
the O
country O
looked O
as O
the O
chaise O
whirled O
rapidly O
from O
mile O

stone O
to O
mile O
- O
stone O
, O
through O
neat O
country O

where O
landlords O
came O
out O
to O
welcome O
him O
with O
smiles O
and O
bows O

by O
pretty O
road O

where O
the O

hung O
on O

To O

with O
you O

Well O
, O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
passed O
through O
all O
this O
from O
Southampton S-GPE

and O
without O
noting O

You O
see O
he O
was O
so O
eager O
to O

his O

at O

He O
grudged O

He O

His O

grizzled O

just O

biting O

“ O

Every O

up O
the O
lane O

Good O

child O

five B-DATE

When O
he O
came O
up O

the O

to O
the O

he O
caught O
hold O

paused O

He O
might O
have O
heard O
the O
thumping O

his O

“ O
May O
God O

“ O

The O

brass O
plate O
was O
still O
on O
the O

at O
the O
knocker O
of O
which O
Dobbin S-PERSON
performed O
a O
summons O
. O
A O
buxom O
- O
looking O
lass O
of O
sixteen S-CARDINAL
, O
with O
bright O
eyes O
and O
purple O
cheeks O
, O
came O
to O
answer O
the O
knock O
, O
and O
looked O
hard O
at O
the O
Major O
as O
he O
leant O
back O
against O
the O
little O
porch O
. O
He O
was O
as O
pale O
as O
a O
ghost O
, O
and O
could O
hardly O
falter O
out O
the O
words O
— O
“ O
Does O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
live O
here O
? O
” O
She O
looked O
him O
hard O
in O
the O
face O
for O
a O
moment O
— O
and O
then O
turning O
white O
too O
— O
said O
, O
“ O
Lord O
bless O
me O
— O
it’s O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
” O
She O
held O
out O
both O
her O
hands O
shaking O
— O
“ O
Don’t O
you O
remember O
me O
? O

she O
said O

“ O
I O
used O
to O
call O
you O
Major O
Sugar O
- O
plums O

” O
On O
which O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
it O
was O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
that O
he O
ever O
so O
conducted O
himself O
in O
his O
life O
, O
the O
Major O
took O
the O
girl O
in O
his O
arms O
and O
kissed O
her O
. O
She O
began O
to O
laugh O
and O
cry O
hysterically O
, O
and O
calling O
out O
“ O
Ma S-PERSON
, O
Pa O
! O
” O
with O
all O
her O
voice O
, O
brought O
up O
those O
worthy O
people O

who O
had O
already O
been O
surveying O
the O
Major O
from O
the O
casement O
of O
the O
ornamental O
kitchen O
, O
and O
were O
astonished O
to O
find O
their O
daughter O
in O
the O
little O
passage O
in O
the O
embrace O
of O
a O

in O
a O
blue O

white O
duck O
trowsers O
. O
“ O
I’m O
an O
old O
friend O
, O
” O
he O
said O
— O
not O
without O
blushing O
though O
. O
“ O
Don’t O
you O
remember O
me O
, O

” O
A O
great O
shaking O
of O

ensued O
— O
Mrs. O
Clapp S-PERSON
was O
greatly O
affected O
and O
delighted O

called O
upon O

to O
interpose O
a O

The O

with O
a O
thousand S-CARDINAL
ejaculatory O

in O
the O

, O
informed O
Major O

of O
what O
we O
know O
already O

of O
particulars O

his O

failed O
him O

He O
did O
not O
care O

it O
bare O
to O
these O
people O

Finally O
, O
he O
was O
informed O
that O
Mrs. O

led O
her O

sad O
life O

she O
behaved O
to O
him O

an O
angel O

be O
sure O
, O
) O
of O
a O
fine O
afternoon O

. O
“ O
I’m O
very O
much O
pressed O
for O
time O

” O
the O
Major O

, O
“ O

I O
should O

” O
Miss O
Polly S-PERSON
was O
charmed O
and O
astonished O
at O
this O
proposal O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
way O
. O
She O
would O
show O
Major O

She O
had O
often O
been O
with O
Mr. O

was O
gone O
— O
was O
gone O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
way O
: O
and O
knew O
the O
bench O
where O
he O
liked O
to O
sit O
. O
She O
bounced O
away O
to O
her O
apartment O
, O
and O
appeared O
presently O
in O
her O
best O
bonnet O

her O
mamma’s O
yellow O
shawl O
and O
large O

she O
assumed O
the O

make O
herself O
a O
worthy O
companion O
for O
the O
Major O

then O
, O
in O
his O
blue O

buckskin O
gloves O
, O
gave O
the O
young O
lady O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
they O
walked O
away O
very O
gaily O
. O
He O
was O
glad O
to O
have O
a O
friend O
at O
hand O
for O
the O
scene O
which O
he O
dreaded O
somehow O
. O
He O
asked O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
more O
questions O
from O
his O
companion O
about O
Amelia S-PERSON
: O
his O
kind O
heart O
grieved O
to O
think O
that O
she O
should O
have O
had O
to O
part O
with O
her O
son O
. O
How O
did O
she O
bear O
it O
? O
Did O
she O
see O
him O
often O
? O
Was O
Mr. O

pretty O
comfortable O
now O
in O
a O
worldly O
point O
of O
view O
? O
Polly S-PERSON
answered O
all O
these O
questions O
of O
Major O

to O
the O
very O
best O
of O
her O
power O

And O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
their O

an O
incident O
occurred O
which O
, O
though O
very O
simple O
in O
its O
nature O
, O
was O
productive O
of O
the O
greatest O
delight O
to O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
A O
pale O
young O

so O
that O
his O

of O

he O
was O
unable O

of O
the O
curtsey O
with O
which O
Miss O

He O
merely O

in O
reply O
to O
her O
salutation O
, O
which O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

returned O
with O
a O
patronising O

at O

. O
Her O
first S-ORDINAL
thought O
was O
, O
that O
something O
had O
happened O
to O
Georgy S-PERSON
| | O
but O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
messenger’s O
eager O
and O
happy O
face O
dissipated O
that O
fear O
in O
the O
timorous O
mother’s O
bosom O
. O
“ O
News O
! O
News O
! O
” O
cried O
the O
emissary O
of O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
“ O
He’s O
come O
! O
He’s O
come O
! O
” O
“ O
Who O
is O
come O
? O
” O
said O
Emmy S-PERSON
, O
still O
thinking O
of O
her O
son O
. O
“ O
Look O
there O
, O
” O
answered O
Miss O
Clapp S-PERSON
, O
turning O
round O
and O
pointing O
| | O
in O
which O
direction O
Amelia S-PERSON
looking O
, O
saw O
Dobbin’s O
lean O
figure O
and O
long O
shadow O
stalking O
across O
the O
grass O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
started O
in O
her O
turn O
, O
blushed O
up O
, O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
At O
all O
this O
simple O
little O
creature’s O
fêtes O
, O
the O
grandes O
eaux O
were O
accustomed O
to O
play O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
— O
oh O
, O
how O
fondly O
— O
as O
she O
came O
running O
towards O
him O
, O
her O
hands O
before O
her O
, O
ready O
to O
give O
them O
to O
him O
. O
She O
wasn’t O
changed O
. O
She O
was O
a O
little O
pale O
: O
a O
little O
stouter O
in O
figure O
. O
Her O
eyes O
were O
the O
same O
, O
the O
kind O
trustful O
eyes O
. O
There O
were O
scarce O
three S-CARDINAL
lines O
of O
silver O
in O
her O
soft O
brown O
hair O
. O
She O
gave O
him O
both O
her O
hands O
as O
she O
looked O
up O
flushing O
and O
smiling O
through O
her O
tears O
into O
his O
honest O
homely O
face O
. O
He O
took O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
hands O
between O
his O
two S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
held O
them O
there O
. O
He O
was O
speechless O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
Why O
did O
he O
not O
take O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
swear O
that O
he O
would O
never O
leave O
her O
? O
She O
must O
have O
yielded O
: O
she O
could O
not O
but O
have O
obeyed O
him O
. O
“ O
I O
— O
I’ve O
another O
arrival O
to O
announce O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
. O
“ O
Mrs. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
? O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
said O
, O
making O
a O
movement O
back O
— O
Why O
didn’t O
he O
speak O
? O
“ O
No O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
letting O
her O
hands O
go O
: O
“ O
Who O
has O
told O
you O
those O
lies O
? O
— O
I O
mean O
, O
your O
brother O
Jos S-PERSON
came O
in O
the O

you O
all O
happy O

” O
“ O
Papa O
, O
papa O

” O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
cried O
out O
, O
“ O
here O

you O

— O
Here O
is O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
” O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
started O
up O
, O
shaking O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
gathering O
up O
his O
thoughts O
. O
Then O
he O
stepped O
forward O
and O
made O
an O
old O
- O
fashioned O
bow O
to O
the O
Major O
, O
whom O
he O
called O
Mr. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
and O
hoped O
his O
worthy O
father O
, O
Sir O
William S-PERSON
, O
was O
quite O
well O
. O
He O
proposed O
to O
call O
upon O
Sir O
William S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
done O
him O
the O
honour O
of O
a O
visit O
a O
short O
time O
ago O
. O
Sir O
William S-PERSON
had O
not O
called O
upon O
the O
old O
gentleman O
for O
eight B-DATE
years E-DATE
— O
it O
was O
that O
visit O
he O
was O
thinking O
of O
returning O
. O
“ O
He O
is O
very O
much O
shaken O
, O
” O
Emmy O
whispered O
, O
as O
Dobbin S-PERSON
went O
up O
and O
cordially O
shook O
hands O
with O
the O
old O
man O
. O
Although O
he O
had O
such O
particular O
business O
in O
London S-GPE
that O
evening O
, O
the O
Major O
consented O
to O
forego O
it O
upon O
Mr. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
invitation O
to O
him O
to O
come O
home O
and O
partake O
of O
tea O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
put O
her O
arm O
under O
that O
of O
her O
young O
friend O
with O
the O
yellow O
shawl O
, O
and O
headed O
the O
party O
on O
their O
return O
homewards O
, O
so O
that O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
fell O
to O
Dobbin’s S-ORG
share O
. O
The O
old O
man O
walked O
very O
slowly O
, O
and O
told O
a O
number O
of O
ancient O
histories O
about O
himself O
and O
his O
poor O
Bessy S-PERSON
, O
his O
former O
prosperity O
, O
and O
his O
bankruptcy O
. O
His O
thoughts O
, O
as O
is O
usual O
with O
failing O
old O
men O
, O
were O
quite O
in O
former O
times O
. O
The O
present O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
one S-CARDINAL
catastrophe O
which O
he O
felt O
, O
he O
knew O
little O
about O
. O
The O
Major O
was O
glad O
to O
let O
him O
talk O
on O
. O
His O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
upon O
the O
figure O
in O
front O
of O
him O
— O
the O
dear O
little O
figure O
always O
present O
to O
his O
imagination O
and O
in O
his O
prayers O
, O
and O
visiting O
his O
dreams O
wakeful O
or O
slumbering O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
very O
happy O
, O
smiling O
, O
and O
active O
all O
that O
evening O
| | O
performing O
her O
duties O
as O
hostess O
of O
the O
little O
entertainment O
with O
the O
utmost O
grace O
and O
propriety O
, O
as O
Dobbin S-PERSON
thought O
. O
His O
eyes O
followed O
her O
about O
as O
they O
sate O
in O
the O
twilight O
. O
How O
many O
a O
time O
had O
he O
longed O
for O
that O
moment O
, O
and O
thought O
of O
her O
far O
away O
under O
hot O
winds O
and O
in O
weary O
marches O
, O
gentle O
and O
happy O
, O
kindly O
ministering O
to O
the O
wants O
of O
old O
age O
, O
and O
decorating O
poverty O
with O
sweet O
submission O
— O
as O
he O
saw O
her O
now O
. O
I O
do O
not O
say O
that O
his O
taste O
was O
the O
highest O
, O
or O
that O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
great O
intellects O
to O
be O
content O
with O
a O
bread O
- O
and O
- O
butter O
paradise O
, O
such O
as O
sufficed O
our O
simple O
old O
friend O
| | O
but O
his O
desires O
were O
of O
this O
sort O
, O
whether O
for O
good O
or O
bad O
| | O
and O
, O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
to O
help O
him O
, O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
drink O
as O
many O
cups O
of O
tea O
as O
Doctor O
Johnson S-PERSON
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
seeing O
this O
propensity O
, O
laughingly O
encouraged O
it O
| | O
and O
looked O
exceedingly O
roguish O
as O
she O
administered O
to O
him O
cup O
after O
cup O
. O
It O
is O
true O
she O
did O
not O
know O
that O
the O
Major O
had O
had O
no O
dinner O
, O
and O
that O
the O
cloth O
was O
laid O
for O
him O
at O
the O
Slaughters O
’ O
, O
and O
a O
plate O
laid O
thereon O
to O
mark O
that O
the O
table O
was O
retained O
, O
in O
that O
very O
box O
in O
which O
the O
Major O
and O
George S-PERSON
had O
sate O
many O
a O
time O
carousing O
, O
when O
she O
was O
a O
child O
just O
come O
home O
from O
Miss B-ORG
Pinkerton’s I-ORG
school E-ORG
. O
The O
first S-ORDINAL
thing O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
showed O
the O
Major O
was O
Georgy’s S-PERSON
miniature O
, O
for O
which O
she O
ran O
upstairs O
on O
her O
arrival O
at O
home O
. O
It O
was O
not O
half O
handsome O
enough O
of O
course O
for O
t O
he O
boy O
, O
but O
wasn’t O
it O
noble O
of O
him O
to O
think O
of O
bringing O
it O
to O
his O
mother O
? O
Whilst O
her O
papa O
was O
awake O
she O
did O
not O
talk O
much O
about O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
To O
hear O
about O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
and O
Russell B-PERSON
Square E-PERSON
was O
not O
agreeable O
to O
the O
old O
man O
, O
who O
very O
likely O
was O
unconscious O
that O
he O
had O
been O
living O
for O
some B-DATE
months E-DATE
past O
mainly O
on O
the O
bounty O
of O
his O
richer O
rival O
| | O
and O
lost O
his O
temper O
if O
allusion O
was O
made O
to O
the O
other O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
told O
him O
all O
, O
and O
a O
little O
more O
perhaps O
than O
all O
, O
that O
had O
happened O
on O
board O
the O
Ramchunder S-PERSON
| | O
and O
exaggerated O
Jos’s S-PERSON
benevolent O
dispositions O
towards O
his O
father O
, O
and O
resolution O
to O
make O
him O
comfortable O
in O
his O
old O
days O
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
during O
the O
voyage O
the O
Major O
had O
impressed O
this O
duty O
most O
strongly O
upon O
his O
fellow O
- O
passenger O
and O
extorted O
promises O
from O
him O
that O
he O
would O
take O
charge O
of O
his O
sister O
and O
her O
child O
. O
He O
soothed O
Jos’s S-PERSON
irritation O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
bills O
which O
the O
old O
gentleman O
had O
drawn O
upon O
him O
, O
gave O
a O
laughing O
account O
of O
his O
own O
sufferings O
on O
the O
same O
score O
, O
and O
of O
the O
famous O
consignment O
of O
wine O
with O
which O
the O
old O
man O
had O
favoured O
him O
: O
and O
brought O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
by O
no O
means O
an O
ill O
- O
natured O
person O
when O
well O
pleased O
and O
moderately O
flattered O
, O
to O
a O
very O
good O
state O
of O
feeling O
regarding O
his O
relatives O
in O
Europe S-LOC
. O
And O
in O
fine O
I O
am O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
Major O
stretched O
the O
truth O
so O
far O
as O
to O
tell O
old O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
that O
it O
was O
mainly O
a O
desire O
to O
see O
his O
parent O
which O
brought O
Jos S-PERSON
once O
more O
to O
Europe S-LOC
. O
At O
his B-TIME
accustomed I-TIME
hour E-TIME
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
began O
to O
doze O
in O
his O
chair O
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
opportunity O
to O
commence O
her O
conversation O
, O
which O
she O
did O
with O
great O
eagerness O
| | O
— O
it O
related O
exclusively O
to O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
She O
did O
not O
talk O
at O
all O
about O
her O
own O
sufferings O
at O
breaking O
from O
him O
, O
for O
indeed O
, O
this O
worthy O
woman O
, O
though O
she O
was O
half S-CARDINAL
- O
killed O
by O
the O
separation O
from O
the O
child O
, O
yet O
thought O
it O
was O
very O
wicked O
in O
her O
to O
repine O
at O
losing O
him O
| | O
but O
everything O
concerning O
him O
, O
his O
virtues O
, O
talents O
, O
and O
prospects O
, O
she O
poured O
out O
. O
She O
described O
his O
angelic O
beauty O

narrated O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
instances O
of O
his O
generosity O
and O
greatness O
of O
mind O
whilst O
living O
with O
her O
: O
how O
a O
Royal O
Duchess O
had O
stopped O
and O
admired O
him O
in O
Kensington B-FAC
Gardens E-FAC
| | O
how O
splendidly O
he O
was O
cared O
for O
now O
, O
and O
how O
he O
had O
a O
groom O
and O
a O
pony O

what O
quickness O
and O
cleverness O
he O
had O
, O
and O
what O
a O
prodigiously O
well O

delightful O
person O
the O
Reverend O
Lawrence B-PERSON

“ O
He O

Amelia S-PERSON
said O

“ O
He O

she O
went O
to O

drew O
out O

all O

Selfishness O
is O
the O
most O
odious O

An O

As O
a O
selfish O
man O

impoverish O

a O

“ O

Emmy S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
great O
flutter O

was O
in O
the O
passage O
among O
the O
hats O

coats O
, O
and O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
in O
the O
parlour O
inside O

shaking O
all O
over O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
descended O
from O
the O
post O

chaise O
and O
down O
the O
creaking O
swaying O
steps O
in O
awful O
state O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
new O
valet O
from O
Southampton S-GPE
and O
the O
shuddering O
native O
, O
whose O
brown O
face O
was O
now O
livid O
with O
cold O
, O
and O
of O
the O
colour O
of O
a O
turkey’s O
gizzard O
. O
He O
created O
an O
immense O
sensation O
in O
the O
passage O
presently O
, O
where O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Clapp S-PERSON
, O
coming O
perhaps O
to O
listen O
at O
the O
parlour O
door O
, O
found O
Loll B-PERSON
Jewab E-PERSON
shaking O
upon O
the O
hall O
- O
bench O
under O
the O
coats O
, O
moaning O
in O
a O
strange O
piteous O
way O
, O
and O
showing O
his O
yellow O
eyeballs O
and O
white O
teeth O
. O
For O
, O
you O
see O
, O
we O
have O
adroitly O
shut O
the O
door O
upon O
the O
meeting O
between O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
the O
old O
father O
, O
and O
the O
poor O
little O
gentle O
sister O
inside O
. O
The O
old O
man O
was O
very O
much O
affected O
: O
so O
, O
of O
course O
, O
was O
his O
daughter O
: O
nor O
was O
Jos S-PERSON
without O
feeling O
. O
In O
that O
long O
absence O
of O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
the O
most O
selfish O
will O
think O
about O
home O
and O
early O
ties O
. O
Distance O
sanctifies O
both O
. O
Long O
brooding O
over O
those O
lost O
pleasures O
exaggerates O
their O
charm O
and O
sweetness O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
unaffectedly O
glad O
to O
see O
and O
shake O
the O
hand O
of O
his O
father O
, O
between O
whom O
and O
himself O
there O
had O
been O
a O
coolness O
— O
glad O
to O
see O
his O
little O
sister O
, O
whom O
he O
remembered O
so O
pretty O
and O
smiling O
, O
and O
pained O
at O
the O
alteration O
which O
time O
, O
grief O
, O
and O
misfortune O
had O
made O
in O
the O
shattered O
old O
man O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
had O
come O
out O
to O
the O
door O
in O
her O
black O
clothes O
and O
whispered O
to O
him O
of O
her O
mother’s O
death O
, O
and O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
it O
to O
their O
father O
. O
There O
was O
no O
need O
of O
this O
caution O
, O
for O
the O
elder O
Sedley S-PERSON
himself O
began O
immediately O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
event O
, O
and O
prattled O
about O
it O
, O
and O
wept O
over O
it O
plenteously O
. O
It O
shocked O
the O
Indian S-NORP
not O
a O
little O
, O
and O
made O
him O
think O
of O
himself O
less O
than O
the O
poor O
fellow O
was O
accustomed O
to O
do O
. O
The O
result O
of O
the O
interview O
must O
have O
been O
very O
satisfactory O
, O
for O
when O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
reascended O
his O
post O
- O
chaise O
, O
and O
had O
driven O
away O
to O
his O
hotel O
, O
Emmy S-PERSON
embraced O
her O
father O
tenderly O
, O
appealing O
to O
him O
with O
an O
air O
of O
triumph O
, O
and O
asking O
the O
old O
man O
whether O
she O
did O
not O
always O
say O
that O
her O
brother O
had O
a O
good O
heart O
? O
Indeed O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
, O
affected O
by O
the O
humble O
position O
in O
which O
he O
found O
his O
relations O
, O
and O
in O
the O
expansiveness O
and O
overflowing O
of O
heart O
occasioned O
by O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
meeting O
, O
declared O
that O
they O
should O
never O
suffer O
want O
or O
discomfort O
any O
more O
, O
that O
he O
was O
at O
home O
for O
some O
time O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
during O
which O
his O
house O
and O
everything O
he O
had O
should O
be O
theirs O
: O
and O
that O
Amelia S-PERSON
would O
look O
very O
pretty O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O
table O
— O
until O
she O
would O
accept O
one O
of O
her O
own O
. O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
sadly O
, O
and O
had O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
recourse O
to O
the O
water O
- O
works O
. O
She O
knew O
what O
he O
meant O
. O
She O
and O
her O
young O
confidante O
, O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
had O
talked O
over O
the O
matter O
most O
fully O
, O
the O
very O
night O
of O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
visit O
: O
beyond O
which O
time O
the O
impetuous O
Polly S-PERSON
could O
not O
refrain O
from O
talking O
of O
the O
discovery O
which O
she O
had O
made O
, O
and O
describing O
the O
start O
and O
tremor O
of O
joy O
by O
which O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
betrayed O
himself O
when O
Mr. O
Binny S-PERSON
passed O
with O
his O
bride O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
learned O
that O
he O
had O
no O
longer O
a O
rival O
to O
fear O
. O
“ O
Didn’t O
you O
see O
how O
he O
shook O
all O
over O
when O
you O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
married O
, O
and O
he O
said O
, O
‘ O
Who O
told O
you O
those O
lies O
? O
’ O
O O
Ma’am O
, O
” O
Polly S-PERSON
said O
, O
“ O
he O
never O
kept O
his O
eyes O
off O
you O
: O
and O
I’m O
sure O
he’s O
grown O
grey O
a O
- O
thinking O
of O
you O
. O
” O
But O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
looking O
up O
at O
her O
bed O
, O
over O
which O
hung O
the O
portraits O
of O
her O
husband O
and O
son O
, O
told O
her O
young O
protégée O
, O
never O
, O
never O
, O
to O
speak O
on O
that O
subject O
again O
| | O
that O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
been O
her O
husband’s O
dearest O
friend O
, O
and O
her O
own O
and O
George’s S-PERSON
most O
kind O
and O
affectionate O
guardian O
| | O
that O
she O
loved O
him O
as O
a O
brother O
— O
but O
that O
a O
woman O
who O
had O
been O
married O
to O
such O
an O
angel O
as O
that O
, O
and O
she O
pointed O
to O
the O
wall O
, O
could O
never O
think O
of O
any O
other O
union O
. O
Poor O
Polly S-PERSON
sighed O
: O
she O
thought O
what O
she O
should O
do O
if O
young O
Mr. O
Tomkins S-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
surgery O
, O
who O
always O
looked O
at O
her O
so O
at O
church O
, O
and O
who O
, O
by O
those O
mere O
aggressive O
glances O
had O
put O
her O
timorous O
little O
heart O
into O
such O
a O
flutter O
that O
she O
was O
ready O
to O
surrender O
at O
once O
, O
— O
what O
she O
should O
do O
if O
he O
were O
to O
die O
? O
She O
knew O
he O
was O
consumptive O
, O
his O
cheeks O
were O
so O
red O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
uncommon O
thin O
in O
the O
waist O
. O
Not O
that O
Emmy S-PERSON
, O
being O
made O
aware O
of O
the O
honest O
Major’s S-PERSON
passion O
, O
rebuffed O
him O
in O
any O
way O
, O
or O
felt O
displeased O
with O
him O
. O
Such O
an O
attachment O
from O
so O
true O
and O
loyal O
a O
gentleman O
could O
make O
no O
woman O
angry O
. O
Desdemona S-PERSON
was O
not O
angry O
with O
Cassio S-PERSON
, O
though O
there O
is O
very O
little O
doubt O
she O
saw O
the O
Lieutenant’s S-NORP
partiality O
for O
her O
( O
and O
I O
for O
my O
part O
believe O
that O
many O
more O
things O
took O
place O
in O
that O
sad O
affair O
than O
the O
worthy O
Moorish S-NORP
officer O
ever O
knew O
of O
) O

why O
, O
Miranda S-PERSON
was O
even O
very O
kind O
to O
Caliban S-PERSON
, O
and O
we O
may O
be O
pretty O
sure O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
. O
Not O
that O
she O
would O
encourage O
him O
in O
the O
least O
, O
— O
the O
poor O
uncouth O
monster O
— O
of O
course O
not O
. O
No O
more O
would O
Emmy O
by O
any O
means O
encourage O
her O
admirer O
, O
the O
Major O
. O
She O
would O
give O
him O
that O
friendly O
regard O
, O
which O
so O
much O
excellence O
and O
fidelity O
merited O

she O
would O
treat O
him O
with O
perfect O
cordiality O
and O
frankness O
until O
he O
made O
his O
proposals O

and O
then O
it O
would O
be O
time O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
hopes O
which O
never O
could O
be O
realised O
. O
She O
slept O
, O
therefore O
, O
very O
soundly O
that O
evening O
, O
after O
the O
conversation O
with O
Miss O
Polly S-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
more O
than O
ordinarily O
happy O

in O
spite O
of O
Jos’s S-PERSON
delaying O

“ O

when O

made O
his O
appearance O

the O
little O
party O
were O
put O

paused O
over O
the O

her O

it O
was O
clear O

Nor O

he O
: O
for O
the O
fact O

that O

suspected O

would O
find O

Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
not O
written O

calamity O

had O

He O
was O

Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
very O
lonely O
at O
Southampton S-GPE
, O
and O
got O
the O
landlord O
of O
the O
George S-PERSON
to O
take O
a O
glass O

at O
the B-TIME
very I-TIME
hour E-TIME

Major O

was O
seated O
at O
the O
table O
of O
his O
father O
, O
Sir O
William S-PERSON
, O
where O
his O
sister O
found O
out O
( O
for O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
the O
Major O
to O
tell O
fibs O
) O
that O
he O
had O
been O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
so O
comfortably O
situated O
in O
St. B-FAC
Martin’s I-FAC
Lane E-FAC
, O
he O
could O
enjoy O
his O
hookah O
there O
with O
such O
perfect O
ease O
, O
and O
could O
swagger O
down O
to O
the O
theatres O
, O
when O
minded O
, O
so O
agreeably O
, O
that O
, O
perhaps O
, O
he O
would O
have O
remained O
altogether O
at O
the O
Slaughters’ O
had O
not O
his O
friend O

the O
Major O

been O
at O
his O
elbow O

That O
gentleman O
would O
not O
let O
the O
Bengalee S-PERSON
rest O
until O
he O
had O
executed O
his O
promise O
of O
having O
a O
home O
for O
Amelia S-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
a O
soft O
fellow O
in O
anybody’s O
hands O

Dobbin S-PERSON
most O
active O
in O
anybody’s O
concerns O
but O
his O
own O

the O
civilian O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
an O
easy O
victim O
to O
the O
guileless O
arts O
of O
this O
good O
- O
natured O
diplomatist O
, O
and O
was O
ready O
to O
do O
, O

purchase O

relinquish O
whatever O
his O

of O
whom O
the O
boys O
about O
St. B-FAC
Martin’s I-FAC
Lane E-FAC
used O
to O
make O
cruel O
fun O
whenever O
he O
showed O
his O
dusky O
countenance O
in O
the O
street O
, O
was O
sent O
back O

in O
which O
Sir O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
had O
a O
share O

having O
previously O
taught O
Jos’s B-NORP
European E-NORP
the O
art O
of O
preparing O
curries O
, O
pilaus O
, O
and O
pipes O
. O
It O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
great O
delight O
and O
occupation O
to O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
superintend O
the O
building O
of O
a O
smart O
chariot O
, O
which O
he O
and O
the O
Major O
ordered O
in O
the O
neighbouring O
Long B-FAC
Acre E-FAC
: O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
handsome O
horses O
were O
jobbed O
, O
with O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
drove O
about O
in O
state O
in O
the O
Park S-LOC
, O
or O
to O
call O
upon O
his O
Indian S-NORP
friends O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
was O
not O
seldom O
by O
his O
side O
on O
these O
excursions O
, O
when O
also O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
would O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
back O
seat O
of O
the O
carriage O
. O
At O
other O
times O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
and O
his O
daughter O
took O
advantage O
of O
it O
: O
and O
Miss O
Clapp S-PERSON
, O
who O
frequently O
accompanied O
her O
friend O
, O
had O
great O
pleasure O
in O
being O
recognised O
as O
she O
sate O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
dressed O
in O
the O
famous O
yellow O
shawl O
, O
by O
the O
young O
gentleman O
at O
the O
surgery O
, O
whose O
face O
might O
commonly O
be O
seen O
over O
the O
window O
- O
blinds O
as O
she O
passed O
. O
Shortly O
after O
Jos’s S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
appearance O
at O
Brompton S-GPE
, O
a O
dismal O
scene O
, O
indeed O
, O
took O
place O
at O
that O
humble O
cottage O
, O
at O
which O
the O
Sedleys S-PERSON
had O
passed O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
ten I-DATE
years E-DATE
of O
their O
life O
. O
Jos’s S-PERSON
carriage O
( O
the O
temporary O
one O
, O
not O
the O
chariot O
under O
construction O
) O
arrived O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
and O
carried O
off O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
and O
his O
daughter O
— O
to O
return O
no O
more O
. O
The O
tears O
that O
were O
shed O
by O
the O
landlady O
and O
the O
landlady’s O
daughter O
at O
that O
event O
were O
as O
genuine O
tears O
of O
sorrow O
as O
any O
that O
have O
been O
outpoured O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
history O
. O
In O
their O
long O
acquaintanceship O
and O
intimacy O
they O
could O
not O
recall O
a O
harsh O
word O
that O
had O
been O
uttered O
by O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
been O
all O
sweetness O
and O
kindness O
, O
always O
thankful O
, O
always O
gentle O
, O
even O
when O
Mrs. O
Clapp S-PERSON
lost O
her O
own O
temper O
, O
and O
pressed O
for O
the O
rent O
. O
When O
the O
kind O
creature O
was O
going O
away O
for O
good O
and O
all O
, O
the O
landlady O
reproached O
herself O
bitterly O
for O
ever O
having O
used O
a O
rough O
expression O
to O
her O
— O
how O
she O
wept O
, O
as O
they O
stuck O
up O
with O
wafers O
on O
the O
window O
, O
a O
paper O
notifying O
that O
the O
little O
rooms O
so O
long O
occupied O
were O
to O
let O
! O
They O
never O
would O
have O
such O
lodgers O
again O
, O
that O
was O
quite O
clear O
. O
After O
- O
life O
proved O
the O
truth O
of O
this O
melancholy O
prophecy O
: O
and O
Mrs. O
Clapp S-PERSON
revenged O
herself O
for O
the O
deterioration O
of O
mankind O
by O
levying O
the O
most O
savage O
contributions O
upon O
the O
tea-caddies O
and O
legs O
of O
mutton O
of O
her O
locataires O
. O
Most O
of O
them O
scolded O
and O
grumbled O
| | O
some O
of O
them O
did O
not O
pay O
: O
none O
of O
them O
stayed O
. O
The O
landlady O
might O
well O
regret O
those O
old O
, O
old O
friends O
, O
who O
had O
left O
her O
. O
As O
for O
Miss O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
her O
sorrow O
at O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
departure O
was O
such O
as O
I O
shall O
not O
attempt O
to O
depict O
. O
From O
childhood O
upwards O
she O
had O
been O
with O
her O
daily O
, O
and O
had O
attached O
herself O
so O
passionately O
to O
that O
dear O
good O
lady O
, O
that O
when O
the O
grand O
barouche O
came O
to O
carry O
her O
off O
into O
splendour O
, O
she O
fainted O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
her O
friend O
, O
who O
was O
indeed O
scarcely O
less O
affected O
than O
the O
good O
- O
natured O
girl O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
loved O
her O
like O
a O
daughter O
. O
During O
eleven B-DATE
years E-DATE
the O
girl O
had O
been O
her O
constant O
friend O
and O
associate O
. O
The O
separation O
was O
a O
very O
painful O
one O
indeed O
to O
her O
. O
But O
it O
was O
of O
course O
arranged O
that O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
to O
come O
and O
stay O
often O
at O
the O
grand O
new O
house O
whither O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
going O
| | O
and O
where O
Mary S-PERSON
was O
sure O
she O
would O
never O
be O
so O
happy O
as O
she O
had O
been O
in O
their O
humble O
cot O
, O
as O
Miss O
Clapp S-PERSON
called O
it O
, O
in O
the O
language O
of O
the O
novels O
which O
she O
loved O
. O
Let O
us O
hope O
she O
was O
wrong O
in O
her O
judgment O
. O
Poor O
Emmy’s B-DATE
days E-DATE
of O
happiness O
had O
been O
very O
few O
in O
that O
humble O
cot O
. O
A O
gloomy O
Fate S-PERSON
had O
oppressed O
her O
there O
. O
She O
never O
liked O
to O
come O
back O
to O
the O
house O
after O
she O
had O
left O
it O
, O
or O
to O
face O
the O
landlady O
who O
had O
tyrannised O
over O
her O
when O
ill O
- O
humoured O
and O
unpaid O
, O
or O
when O
pleased O
had O
treated O
her O
with O
a O
coarse O
familiarity O
scarcely O
less O
odious O
. O
Her O
servility O
and O
fulsome O
compliments O
when O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
in O
prosperity O
were O
not O
more O
to O
that O
lady’s O
liking O
. O
She O
cast O
about O
notes O
of O
admiration O
all O
over O
the O
new O
house O
, O
extolling O
every O
article O
of O
furniture O
or O
ornament O
| | O
she O
fingered O
Mrs. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
dresses O
, O
and O
calculated O
their O
price O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
too O
good O
for O
that O
sweet O
lady O
, O
she O
vowed O
and O
protested O
. O
But O
in O
the O
vulgar O
sycophant O
who O
now O
paid O
court O
to O
her O
, O
Emmy S-PERSON
always O
remembered O
the O
coarse O
tyrant O
who O
had O
made O
her O
miserable O
many O
a O
time O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
put O
up O
petitions O
for O
time O
, O
when O
the O
rent O
was O
overdue O
| | O
who O
cried O
out O
at O
her O
extravagance O
if O
she O
bought O
delicacies O
for O
her O
ailing O
mother O
or O
father O
| | O
who O
had O
seen O
her O
humble O
and O
trampled O
upon O
her O
. O
Nobody O
ever O
heard O
of O
these O
griefs O
, O
which O
had O
been O
part O
of O
our O
poor O
little O
woman’s O
lot O
in O
life O
. O
She O
kept O
them O
secret O
from O
her O
father O
, O
whose O
improvidence O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
much O
of O
her O
misery O
. O
She O
had O
to O
bear O
all O
the O
blame O
of O
his O
misdoings O
, O
and O
indeed O
was O
so O
utterly O
gentle O
and O
humble O
as O
to O
be O
made O
by O
nature O
for O
a O
victim O
. O
I O
hope O
she O
is O
not O
to O
suffer O
much O
more O
of O
that O
hard O
usage O
. O
And O
, O
as O
in O
all O
griefs O
there O
is O
said O
to O
be O
some O
consolation O
, O
I O
may O
mention O
that O
poor O
Mary S-PERSON
, O
when O
left O
at O
her O
friend’s O
departure O
in O
a O
hysterical O
condition O
, O
was O
placed O
under O
the O
medical O
treatment O
of O
the O
young O
fellow O
from O
the O
surgery O
, O
under O
whose O
care O
she O
rallied O
after O
a O
short O
period O
. O
Emmy O
, O
when O
she O
went O
away O
from O
Brompton S-GPE
, O
endowed O
Mary S-PERSON
with O
every O
article O
of O
furniture O
that O
the O
house O
contained O
: O
only O
taking O
away O
her O
pictures O
( O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
pictures O
over O
the O
bed O

and O
her O
piano O
— O
that O
little O

had O
now O
passed O
into O
a O
plaintive O
jingling O
old O
age O
, O
but O
which O
she O
loved O
for O
reasons O
of O
her O
own O
. O
She O
was O
a O
child O
when O
first S-ORDINAL
she O
played O
on O
it O
: O
and O
her O
parents O
gave O
it O
her O
. O
It O
had O
been O
given O
to O
her O
again O
since O
, O
as O
the O
reader O
may O
remember O
, O
when O
her O
father’s O
house O
was O
gone O
to O
ruin O
, O
and O
the O
instrument O
was O
recovered O
out O
of O
the O
wreck O
. O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
exceedingly O
pleased O
when O
, O
as O
he O
was O
superintending O
the O
arrangements O
of O
Jos’s S-PERSON
new O
house O
, O
which O
the O
Major O
insisted O
should O
be O
very O
handsome O
and O
comfortable O
, O
the O
cart O
arrived O
from O
Brompton S-GPE
, O
bringing O
the O
trunks O
and O
band O
- O
boxes O
of O
the O
emigrants O
from O
that O
village O
, O
and O
with O
them O
the O
old O
piano O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
would O
have O
it O
up O
in O
her O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
a O
neat O
little O
apartment O
on O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
floor O
, O
adjoining O
her O
father’s O
chamber O
: O
and O
where O
the O
old O
gentleman O
sate O
commonly O
of O
evenings O
. O
When O
the O
men O
appeared O
then O
bearing O
this O
old O
music O
- O
box O
, O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
gave O
orders O
that O
it O
should O
be O
placed O
in O
the O
chamber O
aforesaid O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
quite O
elated O
. O
“ O
I’m O
glad O
you’ve O
kept O
it O
, O
” O
he O
said O
in O
a O
very O
sentimental O
manner O
. O
“ O
I O
was O
afraid O
you O
didn’t O
care O
about O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
value O
it O
more O
than O
anything O
I O
have O
in O
the O
world O
, O
” O
said O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
” O
cried O
the O
Major O
. O
The O
fact O
was O
, O
as O
he O
had O
bought O
it O
himself O
, O
though O
he O
never O
said O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
it O
never O
entered O
into O
his O
head O
to O
suppose O
that O
Emmy S-PERSON
should O
think O
anybody O
else O
was O
the O
purchaser O
, O
and O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
he O
fancied O
that O
she O
knew O
the O
gift O
came O
from O
him O
. O
“ O
Do O
you O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
? O
” O
he O
said O
| | O
and O
the O
question O
, O
the O
great O
question O
of O
all O
, O
was O
trembling O
on O
his O
lips O
, O
when O
Emmy S-PERSON
replied O
— O
“ O
Can O
I O
do O
otherwise O
? O
— O
did O
not O
he O
give O
it O
me O
? O
” O
“ O
I O
did O
not O
know O
, O
” O
said O
poor O
old O
Dob S-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
countenance O
fell O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
did O
not O
note O
the O
circumstance O
at O
the O
time O
, O
nor O
take O
immediate O
heed O
of O
the O
very O
dismal O
expression O
which O
honest O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
countenance O
assumed O
| | O
but O
she O
thought O
of O
it O
afterwards O
. O
And O
then O
it O
struck O
her O
, O
with O
inexpressible O
pain O
and O
mortification O
too O
, O
that O
it O
was O
William S-PERSON
who O
was O
the O
giver O
of O
the O
piano O
| | O
and O
not O
George S-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
had O
fancied O
. O
It O
was O
not O
George’s S-PERSON
gift O
| | O
the O
only O
one O
which O
she O
had O
received O
from O
her O
lover O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
— O
the O
thing O
she O
had O
cherished O
beyond O
all O
others O
— O
her O
dearest O
relic O
and O
prize O
. O
She O
had O
spoken O
to O
it O
about O
George S-PERSON
| | O
played O
his O
favourite O
airs O
upon O
it O
: O
sate O
for O
long O
evening O
hours O
, O
touching O
, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
her O
simple O
art O
, O
melancholy O
harmonies O
on O
the O
keys O
, O
and O
weeping O
over O
them O
in O
silence O
. O
It O
was O
not O
George’s S-PERSON
relic O
. O
It O
was O
valueless O
now O
. O
The O
next O
time O
that O
old O
Sedley S-PERSON
asked O
her O
to O
play O
, O
she O
said O
it O
was O
shockingly O
out O
of O
tune O
, O
that O
she O
had O
a O
headache O
, O
that O
she O
couldn’t O
play O
. O
Then O
, O
according O
to O
her O
custom O
, O
she O
rebuked O
herself O
for O
her O
pettishness O
and O
ingratitude O
, O
and O
determined O
to O
make O
a O
reparation O
to O
honest O
William S-PERSON
for O
the O
slight O
she O
had O
not O
expressed O
to O
him O
, O
but O
had O
felt O
for O
his O
piano O
. O
A O
few O
days O
afterwards O
, O
as O
they O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
where O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
fallen O
asleep O
with O
great O
comfort O
after O
dinner O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
said O
with O
rather O
a O
faltering O
voice O
to O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
— O
“ O
I O
have O
to O
beg O
your O
pardon O
for O
something O
. O
” O
“ O
About O
what O
? O
” O
said O
he O
. O
“ O
About O
— O
about O
that O
little O
square O
piano O
. O
I O
never O
thanked O
you O
for O
it O
when O
you O
gave O
it O
me O

Thank O
you O
, O
William S-PERSON

” O
She O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
| | O
but O
the O
poor O
little O
woman’s O
heart O
was O
bleeding O

and O
as O
for O
her O
eyes O
, O
of O
course O
they O
were O
at O
their O
work O

William S-PERSON
could O
hold O
no O
more O

“ O

to O

me O
the O
Amelia S-PERSON

singing O

we O
went O
to O
Vauxhall S-ORG

one S-CARDINAL
woman O

that O

hid O

The O
Major O
folded O
his O

the O

down O

The O

was O
Jos’s S-PERSON
valet O
also O
, O
and O
never O
was O
more O
drunk O
than O
a O
butler O

a O
small O
family O

be O
who O
has O
a O
proper O
regard O

Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
supplied O
with O
a O
maid O
, O
grown O
on O
Sir O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin’s E-PERSON
suburban O
estate O
| | O
a O
good O
girl O
, O
whose O
kindness O
and O
humility O
disarmed O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
terrified O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
a O
servant O
to O
wait O
upon O
herself O
, O
who O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
know O
how O
to O
use O
one O
, O
and O
who O
always O
spoke O
to O
domestics O
with O
the O
most O
reverential O
politeness O
. O
But O
this O
maid O
was O
very O
useful O
in O
the O
family O
, O
in O
dexterously O
tending O
old O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
who O
kept O
almost O
entirely O
to O
his O
own O
quarter O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
never O
mixed O
in O
any O
of O
the O
gay O
doings O
which O
took O
place O
there O
. O
Numbers O
of O
people O
came O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
Lady O
Dobbin S-PERSON
and O
daughters O
were O
delighted O
at O
her O
change O
of O
fortune O
, O
and O
waited O
upon O
her O
. O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
from O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
came O
in O
her O
grand O
chariot O
with O
the O
flaming O
hammer O
- O
cloth O
emblazoned O
with O
the O
Leeds S-GPE
arms O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
reported O
to O
be O
immensely O
rich O
. O
Old O
Osborne S-PERSON
had O
no O
objection O
that O
Georgy S-PERSON
should O
inherit O
his O
uncle’s O
property O
as O
well O
as O
his O
own O
. O
“ O
Damn O
it O
, O
we O
will O
make O
a O
man O
of O
the O
feller O
, O
” O
he O
said O

“ O
and O
I’ll S-PERSON
see O
him O
in O
Parliament S-ORG
before O
I O
die O
. O
You O
may O
go O
and O
see O
his O
mother O
, O
Miss O
O. S-PERSON
, O
though O
I’ll S-PERSON
never O
set O
eyes O
on O
her O

” O
and O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
came O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
, O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
see O
her O
, O
and O
so O
be O
brought O
nearer O
to O
George S-PERSON
. O
That O
young O
fellow O
was O
allowed O
to O
come O
much O
more O
frequently O
than O
before O
to O
visit O
his O
mother O
. O
He O
dined O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
week O
in O
Gillespie B-FAC
Street E-FAC
, O
and O
bullied O
the O
servants O
and O
his O
relations O
there O
, O
just O
as O
he O
did O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
He O
was O
always O
respectful O
to O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
and O
more O
modest O
in O
his O
demeanour O
when O
that O
gentleman O
was O
present O
. O
He O
was O
a O
clever O
lad O
, O
and O
afraid O
of O
the O
Major O
. O
George S-PERSON
could O
not O
help O
admiring O
his O
friend’s O
simplicity O
, O
his O
good O
- O
humour O
, O
his O
various O
learning O
quietly O
imparted O
, O
his O
general O
love O
of O
truth O
and O
justice O
. O
He O
had O
met O
no O
such O
man O
as O
yet O
in O
the O
course O
of O
his O
experience O
, O
and O
he O
had O
an O
instinctive O
liking O
for O
a O
gentleman O
. O
He O
hung O
fondly O
by O
his O
godfather’s O
side O
| | O
and O
it O
was O
his O
delight O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
Parks O
and O
hear O
Dobbin S-PERSON
talk O
. O
William S-PERSON
told O
George S-PERSON
about O
his O
father O
, O
about O
India S-GPE
and O
Waterloo S-GPE
, O
about O
everything O
but O
himself O
. O
When O
George S-PERSON
was O
more O
than O
usually O
pert O
and O
conceited O
, O
the O
Major O
made O
jokes O
at O
him O
, O
which O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
thought O
very O
cruel O
. O
One B-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
taking O
him O
to O
the O
play O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
declining O
to O
go O
into O
the O
pit O
because O
it O
was O
vulgar O
, O
the O
Major O
took O
him O
to O
the O
boxes O
, O
left O
him O
there O
, O
and O
went O
down O
himself O
to O
the O
pit O
. O
He O
had O
not O
been O
seated O
there O
very O
long O
, O
before O
he O
felt O
an O
arm O
thrust O
under O
him O
, O
and O
a O
dandy O
little O
hand O
in O
a O
kid O
- O
glove O
squeezing O
his O
arm O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
seen O
the O
absurdity O
of O
his O
ways O
, O
and O
come O
down O
from O
the O
upper O
region O
. O
A O
tender O
laugh O
of O
benevolence O
lighted O
up O
old O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
face O
and O
eyes O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
repentant O
little O
prodigal O
. O
He O
loved O
the O
boy O
, O
as O
he O
did O
everything O
that O
belonged O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
How O
charmed O
she O
was O
when O
she O
heard O
of O
this O
instance O
of O
George’s O
goodness O
! O
Her O
eyes O
looked O
more O
kindly O
on O
Dobbin S-PERSON
than O
they O
ever O
had O
done O
. O
She O
blushed O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
after O
looking O
at O
him O
so O
. O
Georgy S-PERSON
never O
tired O
of O
his O
praises O
of O
the O
Major O
to O
his O
mother O
. O
“ O
I O
like O
him O
, O
Mamma S-PERSON
, O
because O
he O
knows O
such O
lots O
of O
things O
| | O
and O
he O
ain’t O
like O
old O
Veal S-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
always O
bragging O
and O
using O
such O
long O
words O
, O
don’t O
you O
know O
? O
The O
chaps O
call O
him O
‘ O
Longtail S-WORK_OF_ART
’ O
at O
school O
. O
I O
gave O
him O
the O
name O
| | O
ain’t O
it O
capital O
? O
But O
Dob S-PERSON
reads O
Latin S-LANGUAGE
like O
English S-LANGUAGE
, O
and O
French S-LANGUAGE
and O
that O
| | O
and O
when O
we O
go O
out O
together O
he O
tells O
me O
stories O
about O
my O
Papa S-PERSON
, O
and O
never O
about O
himself O
| | O
though O
I O
heard O
Colonel O
Buckler S-PERSON
, O
at O
Grandpapa’s S-ORG
, O
say O
that O
he O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
bravest O
officers O
in O
the O
army O
, O
and O
had O
distinguished O
himself O
ever O
so O
much O
. O
Grandpapa S-PERSON
was O
quite O
surprised O
, O
and O
said O
, O
‘ O
That O
feller O
! O
why O
, O
I O
didn’t O
think O
he O
could O
say O
Bo S-PERSON
to O
a O
goose O
’— O
but O
I O
know O
he O
could O
, O
couldn’t O
he O
, O
Mamma S-PERSON
? O
” O
Emmy S-PERSON
laughed O
: O
she O
thought O
it O
was O
very O
likely O
the O
Major O
could O
do O
thus O
much O
. O
If O
there O
was O
a O
sincere O
liking O
between O
George S-PERSON
and O
the O
Major O
, O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
that O
between O
the O
boy O
and O
his O
uncle O
no O
great O
love O
existed O
. O
George S-PERSON
had O
got O
a O
way O
of O
blowing O
out O
his O
cheeks O
, O
and O
putting O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
waistcoat O
pockets O
, O
and O
saying O
, O
“ O
God O
bless O
my O
soul O
, O
you O
don’t O
say O
so O
, O
” O
so O
exactly O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
old O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
refrain O
from O
laughter O
. O
The O
servants O
would O
explode O
at O
dinner O
if O
the O
lad O
, O
asking O
for O
something O
which O
wasn’t O
at O
table O
, O
put O
on O
that O
countenance O
and O
used O
that O
favourite O
phrase O
. O
Even O
Dobbin S-PERSON
would O
shoot O
out O
a O
sudden O
peal O
at O
the O
boy’s O
mimicry O
. O
If O
George S-PERSON
did O
not O
mimic O
his O
uncle O
to O
his O
face O
, O
it O
was O
only O
by O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
rebukes O
and O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
terrified O
entreaties O
that O
the O
little O
scapegrace O
was O
induced O
to O
desist O
. O
And O
the O
worthy O
civilian O
being O
haunted O
by O
a O
dim O
consciousness O
that O
the O
lad O
thought O
him O
an O
ass O
, O
and O
was O
inclined O
to O
turn O
him O
into O
ridicule O
, O
used O
to O
be O
extremely O
timorous O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
doubly O
pompous O
and O
dignified O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
Master O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
When O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
the O
young O
gentleman O
was O
expected O
in O
Gillespie B-FAC
Street E-FAC
to O
dine O
with O
his O
mother O
, O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
commonly O
found O
that O
he O
had O
an O
engagement O
at O
the O
Club S-ORG
. O
Perhaps O
nobody O
was O
much O
grieved O
at O
his O
absence O
. O
On O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
would O
commonly O
be O
induced O
to O
come O
out O
from O
his O
place O
of O
refuge O
in O
the O
upper O
storeys O

and O
there O
would O
be O
a O
small O
family O
party O
, O
whereof O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
pretty O
generally O
formed O
one O

was O

“ O

Miss O

remarked O

at O
Camberwell S-GPE
. O
Ah O
! O
Miss O

, O
did O
it O
not O

you O
whom O
the O
Major O
wanted O
to O
marry O

Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
then O
led O
a O
life O
of O
dignified O
otiosity O
such O
as O
became O
a O
person O
of O
his O
eminence O

His O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
point O

of O
course O

was O
to O
become O
a O

The O
period O
of O
mourning O
for O
Mrs. O
Sedley’s S-PERSON
death O
was O
only O
just O
concluded O
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
scarcely O
had O
had O
time O
to O
cast O
off O
his O
black O
and O
appear O
in O
the O
splendid O
waistcoats O
which O
he O
loved O
, O
when O
it O
became O
evident O
to O
those O
about O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
, O
that O
another O
event O
was O
at O
hand O
, O
and O
that O
the O
old O
man O
was O
about O
to O
go O
seek O
for O
his O
wife O
in O
the O
dark O
land O
whither O
she O
had O
preceded O
him O
. O
“ O
The O
state O
of O
my O
father’s O
health O
, O
” O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
solemnly O
remarked O
at O
the O
Club S-ORG
, O
“ O
prevents O
me O

, O
Chutney O

my O

a O
homely O
dinner O
with O
one S-CARDINAL

two S-CARDINAL

the O

set O
— O
I O
shall O
be O
always O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
. O
” O
So O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
his O
acquaintances O
dined O
and O
drank O
their O
claret O
among O
themselves O
in O
silence O
| | O
whilst O
the O
sands O
of O
life O
were O
running O
out O
in O
the O
old O
man’s O
glass O
upstairs O
. O
The O
velvet O
- O
footed O
butler O
brought O
them O
their O
wine O
| | O
and O
they O
composed O
themselves O
to O
a O
rubber O
after O
dinner O
: O
at O
which O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
would O
sometimes O
come O
and O
take O
a O
hand O
: O
and O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
would O
occasionally O
descend O
, O
when O
her O
patient O
above O
was O
settled O
for O
the O
night O
, O
and O
had O
commenced O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
those O
lightly O
troubled O
slumbers O
which O
visit O
the O
pillow O
of O
old O
age O
. O
The O
old O
man O
clung O
to O
his O
daughter O
during O
this O
sickness O
. O
He O
would O
take O
his O
broths O
and O
medicines O
from O
scarcely O
any O
other O
hand O
. O
To O
tend O
him O
became O
almost O
the O
sole O
business O
of O
her O
life O
. O
Her O
bed O
was O
placed O
close O
by O
the O
door O
which O
opened O
into O
his O
chamber O
, O
and O
she O
was O
alive O
at O
the O
slightest O
noise O
or O
disturbance O
from O
the O
couch O
of O
the O
querulous O
invalid O
. O
Though O
, O
to O
do O
him O
justice O
, O
he O
lay O
awake O
many B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
, O
silent O
and O
without O
stirring O
, O
unwilling O
to O
awaken O
his O
kind O
and O
vigilant O
nurse O
. O
He O
loved O
his O
daughter O
with O
more O
fondness O
now O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
ever O
he O
had O
done O
since O
the O
days O
of O
her O
childhood O
. O
In O
the O
discharge O
of O
gentle O
offices O
and O
kind O
filial O
duties O
, O
this O
simple O
creature O
shone O
most O
especially O
. O
“ O
She O
walks O
into O
the O
room O
as O
silently O
as O
a O
sunbeam O
, O
” O
Mr. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
thought O
, O
as O
he O
saw O
her O
passing O
in O
and O
out O
from O
her O
father’s O
room O
| | O
a O
cheerful O
sweetness O
lighting O
up O
her O
face O
as O
she O
moved O
to O
and O
fro O
, O
graceful O
and O
noiseless O
. O
When O
women O
are O
brooding O
over O
their O
children O
, O
or O
busied O
in O
a O
sick O
- O
room O
, O
who O
has O
not O
seen O
in O
their O
faces O
those O
sweet O
angelic O
beams O
of O
love O
and O
pity O
? O
A O
secret O
feud O
of O
some O
years’ O
standing O
was O
thus O
healed O
: O
and O
with O
a O
tacit O
reconciliation O
. O
In O
these B-TIME
last I-TIME
hours E-TIME
, O
and O
touched O
by O
her O
love O
and O
goodness O
, O
the O
old O
man O
forgot O
all O
his O
grief O
against O
her O
, O
and O
wrongs O
which O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
had O
many O
a O
long O
night O
debated O
: O
how O
she O
had O
given O
up O
everything O
for O
her O
boy O
: O
how O
she O
was O
careless O
of O
her O
parents O
in O
their O
old O
age O
and O
misfortune O
, O
and O
only O
thought O
of O
the O
child O
: O
how O
absurdly O
and O
foolishly O
, O
impiously O
indeed O
, O
she O
took O
on O
, O
when O
George S-PERSON
was O
removed O
from O
her O
. O
Old O
Sedley S-PERSON
forgot O
these O
charges O
as O
he O
was O
making O
up O
his O
last O
account O
, O
and O
did O
justice O
to O
the O
gentle O
and O
uncomplaining O
little O
martyr O
. O
One B-TIME
night E-TIME
when O
she O
stole O
into O
his O
room O
, O
she O
found O
him O
awake O
, O
when O
the O
broken O
old O
man O
made O
his O
confession O
. O
“ O
O O
Emmy O
, O
I’ve O
been O
thinking O
we O
were O
very O
unkind O
and O
unjust O
to O
you O

” O
he O
said O
, O
and O
put O
out O
his O
cold O
and O
feeble O
hand O
to O
her O
. O
She O
knelt O
down O
and O
prayed O
by O
his O
bedside O
, O
as O
he O
did O
too O
, O
having O
still O
hold O
of O
her O
hand O

her O

was O
bowed O
down O
by O
no O

grief O

rather O
solemn O

sorrowful O

prayed O
that O
her O

be O

remembered O
the O
existence O

such O

When O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
first O
heard O
from O
his O
friend O
Colonel B-PERSON
Buckler E-PERSON
( O
as O
little O
Georgy S-PERSON
has O
already O
informed O
us O
) O
how O
distinguished O
an O
officer O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
was O
, O
he O
exhibited O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
scornful O
incredulity O
, O
and O
expressed O
his O
surprise O
how O
ever O
such O
a O
feller O
as O
that O
should O
possess O
either O
brains O

reputation O
. O
But O
he O
heard O
of O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
fame O
from O
various O
members O
of O
his O
society O
. O
Sir O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin E-PERSON
had O
a O
great O
opinion O
of O
his O
son O
, O
and O
narrated O
many O
stories O
illustrative O
of O
the O
Major’s S-NORP
learning O
, O
valour O
, O
and O
estimation O
of O
the O
world’s O
opinion O
. O
Finally O
, O
his O
name O
appeared O
in O
the O
lists O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
great O
parties O
of O
the O
nobility O
: O
and O
this O
circumstance O
had O
a O
prodigious O
effect O
upon O
the O
old O
aristocrat O
of O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC
. O
The O
Major’s S-PERSON
position O
, O
as O
guardian O
to O
Georgy S-PERSON
, O
whose O
possession O
had O
been O
ceded O
to O
his O
grandfather O
, O
rendered O
some O
meetings O
between O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
inevitable O

and O
it O
was O
in O
one O
of O
these O
that O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
a O
keen O
man O
of O
business O
, O
looking O
into O
the O
Major’s S-NORP
accounts O
with O
his O
ward O
and O
the O
boy’s O
mother O
, O
got O
a O
hint O
which O
staggered O
him O
very O
much O
, O
and O
at O
once O
pained O
and O
pleased O
him O
, O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin’s E-PERSON
own O
pocket O
that O
a O
part O

the O

supplied O
upon O

the O
poor O
widow O

subsisted O

When O
pressed O
upon O
the O
point O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
could O
not O
tell O
lies O
, O
blushed O
and O
stammered O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
and O
finally O
confessed O
. O
“ O
The O
marriage O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
( O
at O
which O
his O
interlocutor’s O
face O
grew O
dark O
, O
) O
“ O
was O
very O
much O
my O
doing O

thought O
my O

gone O
so O
far O
, O
that O
retreat O
from O
his O
engagement O

dishonour O

him O

death O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON

I O
could O
do O
no O
less O

” O
“ O
Major O
D. S-NORP
, O
” O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
, O
looking O
hard O
at O
him O
, O
and O
turning O
very O
red O
— O
“ O
you O
did O
me O
a O
great O
injury O

give O
me O

honest O
feller O

my O
hand O

sir O

though O
I O
little O
thought O
that O
my O
flesh O

blood O
was O
living O
on O
you O
— O
” O
and O
the O
pair O
shook O
hands O
, O
with O
great O
confusion O
on O
Major O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
part O
, O
thus O
found O
out O
in O
his O
act O
of O
charitable O
hypocrisy O
. O
He O
strove O
to O
soften O
the O
old O
man O
, O
and O
reconcile O
him O
towards O
his O
son’s O
memory O
. O
“ O
He O
was O
such O
a O
noble O
fellow O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
that O
all O
of O
us O
loved O
him O

and O
would O
have O
done O
anything O

him O
. O
I O
, O
as O
a O
young O
man O
in O
those B-DATE
days E-DATE
, O
was O
flattered O
beyond O
measure O
by O
his O
preference O
for O
me O

and O
was O
more O
pleased O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
his O
company O
than O
in O
that O
of O
the O
Commander O
- O
in O
- O
Chief O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
his O
equal O
for O
pluck O
and O
daring O
, O
and O
all O
the O
qualities O
of O
a O
soldier O
| | O
” O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
told O
the O
old O
father O
as O
many O
stories O
as O
he O
could O
remember O
regarding O
the O
gallantry O
and O
achievements O
of O
his O
son O
. O
“ O
And O
Georgy S-PERSON
is O
so O
like O
him O
, O
” O
the O
Major O
added O
. O
“ O
He’s O
so O
like O
him O
that O
he O
makes O
me O
tremble O
sometimes O
, O
” O
the O
grandfather O
said O
. O
On O
one B-TIME
or I-TIME
two I-TIME
evenings E-TIME
the O
Major O
came O
to O
dine O
with O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
( O
it O
was O
during O
the O
time O
of O
the O
sickness O
of O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
) O
, O
and O
as O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
sate O
together O
in O
the O
evening O
after O
dinner O
all O
their O
talk O
was O
about O
the O
departed O
hero O
. O
The O
father O
boasted O
about O
him O
according O
to O
his O
wont O
, O
glorifying O
himself O
in O
recounting O
his O
son’s O
feats O
and O
gallantry O
, O
but O
his O
mood O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
better O
and O
more O
charitable O
than O
that O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
disposed O
until O
now O
to O
regard O
the O
poor O
fellow O
| | O
and O
the O
Christian S-NORP
heart O
of O
the O
kind O
Major O
was O
pleased O
at O
these O
symptoms O
of O
returning O
peace O
and O
good O
will O
. O
On O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
evening O
old O
Osborne S-PERSON
called O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
William S-PERSON
, O
just O
as O
he O
used O
to O
do O
at O
the O
time O
when O
Dobbin S-PERSON
and O
George S-PERSON
were O
boys O
together O
: O
and O
the O
honest O
gentleman O
was O
pleased O
by O
that O
mark O
of O
reconciliation O
. O
On O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day E-DATE
at O
breakfast O
when O
Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
asperity O
of O
her O
age O
and O
character O
, O
ventured O
to O
make O
some O
remark O
reflecting O
slightly O
upon O
the O
Major’s S-PERSON
appearance O
or O
behaviour O
— O
the O
master O
of O
the O
house O
interrupted O
her O
. O
“ O
You’d O
have O
been O
glad O
enough O
to O
git O
him O
for O
yourself O
, O
Miss O
O O
. O
But O
them O
grapes O
are O
sour O
. O
Ha O
! O
ha O
! O
Major O
William S-PERSON
is O
a O
fine O
feller O
. O
” O
“ O
That O
he O
is O
, O
Grandpapa S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
Georgy S-PERSON
, O
approvingly O
: O
and O
going O
up O
close O
to O
the O
old O
gentleman O
he O
took O
a O
hold O
of O
his O
large O
grey O
whiskers O
, O
and O
laughed O
in O
his O
face O
good O
- O
humouredly O
and O
kissed O
him O
. O
And O
he O
told O
the O
story O
at O
night O
to O
his O
mother O
| | O
who O
fully O
agreed O
with O
the O
boy O
. O
“ O
Indeed O
he O
is O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
Your O
dear O
father O
always O
said O
so O
. O
He O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
and O
most O
upright O
of O
men O
. O
” O
Dobbin S-PERSON
happened O
to O
drop O
in O
very O
soon O
after O
this O
conversation O
, O
which O
made O
Amelia S-PERSON
blush O
perhaps O
: O
and O
the O
young O
scapegrace O
increased O
the O
confusion O
by O
telling O
Dobbin S-PERSON
the O
other O
part O
of O
the O
story O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
, O
Dob O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
there’s O
such O
an O
uncommon O
nice O
girl O
wants O
to O
marry O
you O
. O
She’s O
plenty O
of O
tin O

she O
wears O
a O
front O
: O
and O
she O
scolds O
the O
servants O
from O
morning O
till O
night O
. O
” O
“ O
Who O
is O
it O
? O
” O
asked O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
“ O
It’s O
aunt O
O. O
, O
” O
the O
boy O
answered O
. O
“ O
Grandpapa S-PERSON
said O
so O
. O
And O
I O
say O
, O
Dob O
, O
how O
prime O
it O
would O
be O
to O
have O
you O
for O
my O
uncle O

” O
Old O
Sedley’s S-NORP
quavering O
voice O
from O
the O
next O
room O
at O
this O
moment O
weakly O
called O
for O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
laughing O
ended O
. O
That O
old O
Osborne’s S-NORP
mind O
was O
changing O
, O
was O
pretty O
clear O
. O
He O
asked O
George S-PERSON
about O
his O
uncle O
sometimes O
, O
and O
laughed O
at O
the O
boy’s O
imitation O
of O
the O
way O
in O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
said O
, O
“ O
God O

bless O
- O
my O
- O
soul O
, O
” O
and O
gobbled O
his O
soup O
. O
Then O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
It’s O
not O
respectful O

” O
The O
card O
was O
returned O
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
and O
the O
Major O
were O
asked O
to O
dinner O
, O
— O
to O
a O
dinner O
the O
most O
splendid O
and O
stupid O
that O
perhaps O
ever O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
gave O

every O
inch O
of O
the O
family O
plate O
was O
exhibited O
, O
and O
the O
best O
company O
was O
asked O
. O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
took O
down O
Miss O
O. S-PERSON
to O
dinner O
, O
and O
she O
was O
very O
gracious O
to O
him O
| | O
whereas O
she O
hardly O
spoke O
to O
the O
Major O
, O
who O
sat O
apart O
from O
her O
, O
and O
by O
the O
side O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
very O
timid O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
great O
solemnity O
, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
turtle O
soup O
he O
had O
ever O
tasted O
in O
his O
life O
| | O
and O
asked O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
where O
he O
got O
his O
Madeira S-GPE
? O
“ O
It O
is O
some O
of O
Sedley’s O
wine O
, O
” O
whispered O
the O
butler O
to O
his O
master O
. O
“ O
I’ve O
had O
it O
a O
long O
time O
, O

paid O
a O
good O
figure O
for O
it O
, O
too O
, O
” O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
aloud O
, O
to O
his O
guest O

and O
then O
whispered O
to O
his O
right O
- O
hand O
neighbour O
how O
he O
had O
got O
it O
“ O
at O
the O
old O
chap’s O
sale O
. O
” O
More O
than O
once O
he O
asked O
the O
Major O
about O
— O
about O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
— O
a O
theme O
on O
which O
the O
Major O
could O
be O
very O
eloquent O
when O
he O
chose O
. O
He O
told O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
of O
her O
sufferings O
— O
of O
her O
passionate O
attachment O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
whose O
memory O
she O
worshipped O
still O
— O
of O
the O
tender O
and O
dutiful O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
had O
supported O
her O
parents O
, O
and O
given O
up O
her O
boy O
, O
when O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
her O
duty O
to O
do O
so O
. O
“ O
You O
don’t O
know O
what O
she O
endured O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
said O
honest O
Dobbin S-PERSON
with O
a O
tremor O
in O
his O
voice O
| | O
“ O
and O
I O
hope O
and O
trust O
you O
will O
be O
reconciled O
to O
her O

If O
she O
took O
your O
son O
away O
from O
you O
, O
she O
gave O
hers O
to O
you O

however O
much O
you O
loved O
your O
George S-PERSON
, O

on O
it O
, O
she O
loved O
hers O
ten S-CARDINAL
times O
more O

“ O
By O
God O
, O
you O
are O
a O
good O
feller O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
was O
all O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
. O
It O
had O
never O
struck O
him O
that O
the O
widow O
would O
feel O
any O
pain O
at O
parting O
from O
the O
boy O
, O
or O
that O
his O
having O
a O
fine O
fortune O
could O
grieve O
her O
. O
A O
reconciliation O
was O
announced O
as O
speedy O
and O
inevitable O
| | O
and O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
heart O
already O
began O
to O
beat O
at O
the O
notion O
of O
the O
awful O
meeting O
with O
George’s S-PERSON
father O
. O
It O
was O
never O
, O
however O
, O
destined O
to O
take O
place O
. O
Old O
Sedley’s O
lingering O
illness O
and O
death O
supervened O
, O
after O
which O
a O
meeting O
was O
for O
some O
time O
impossible O
. O
That O
catastrophe O
and O
other O
events O
may O
have O
worked O
upon O
Mr. O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
much O
shaken O
of O
late O
, O
and O
aged O
, O
and O
his O
mind O
was O
working O
inwardly O
. O
He O
had O
sent O
for O
his O
lawyers O
, O
and O
probably O
changed O
something O
in O
his O
will O
. O
The O
medical O
man O
who O
looked O
in O
, O
pronounced O
him O
shaky O
, O
agitated O
, O
and O
talked O
of O
a O
little O
blood O
and O
the O
sea-side O

but O
he O
took O
neither O
of O
these O
remedies O
. O
One B-DATE
day E-DATE
when O
he O
should O
have O
come O
down O
to O
breakfast O
, O
his O
servant O
missing O
him O
, O
went O
into O
his O
dressing O

room O

found O
him O
lying O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
dressing O

table O
in O
a O
fit O

Miss O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
apprised O

the O
doctors O
were O
sent O
for O
, O
Georgy S-PERSON
stopped O
away O
from O
school O

the O
bleeders O

cuppers O
came O

Osborne S-PERSON
partially O
regained O
cognizance O

but O
never O
could O
speak O
again O
, O
though O
he O
tried O
dreadfully O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
and O
in O
four B-DATE
days E-DATE
died O
. O
The O
doctors O
went O
down O
, O

the O
undertaker’s O
men O
went O
up O
the O
stairs O

all O
the O
shutters O
were O
shut O
towards O
the O

Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC

Bullock S-PERSON
rushed O
from O
the O
City O
in O
a O
hurry O

“ O
How O
much O
money O
had O

It O

an O
agitating O

that O
poor O
old O
man O

once O

twice O
in O
vain O
to O

I O
hope O
it O
was O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
see O
Amelia S-PERSON

be O
reconciled O

left O
the O
world O
to O
the O
dear O
and O
faithful O
wife O
of O
his O
son O
: O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
that O

for O
his O
will O
showed O
that O
the O
hatred O
which O
he O
had O
so O
long O
cherished O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
his O
heart O
. O
They O
found O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
dressing O

gown O
the O
letter O
with O
the O
great O
red O
seal O

which O
George S-PERSON
had O
written O
him O
from O
Waterloo S-GPE

He O
had O
looked O
at O
the O
other O
papers O

too O
, O
relative O
to O
his O
son O

for O

kept O
them O

also O

it O
was O
found O
the O
seals O

been O
broken O

very O
likely O
on O
the O
night O
before O
the O

the O
butler O
had O
taken O
him O

found O

found O
that O

When O
Amelia S-PERSON
heard O
that O

reconciled O

was O
grateful O

when O
she O
heard O
how O

restored O
to O
her O

knew O
how O

how O
it O
was O
William’s S-PERSON

sank O
on O

prayed O

constant O

bowed O
down O

up O

became O
known O

out O

Emmy O

The O

bore O
the O
marks O

Then O
they O

up O

great O
blank O
stone O

staircases O
into O
the O
upper O

George S-PERSON

then O
higher O
still O
into O
George’s S-PERSON

room O
. O
The O
boy O
was O
still O
clinging O
by O
her O
side O
, O
but O
she O
thought O
of O
another O
besides O
him O
. O
She O
knew O
that O
it O
had O
been O
his O
father’s O
room O
as O
well O
as O
his O
own O

She O
went O
up O
to O
one S-CARDINAL

the O
open O
windows O
( O
one O
of O
those O
at O
which O
she O
used O
to O
gaze O
with O
a O
sick O
heart O
when O
the O
child O
was O
first O
taken O
from O
her O

, O
and O
thence O
as O
she O
looked O

the O
old O

she O

where O
she O
had O
passed O
so O
many O
happy O
days O
of O
sacred O
youth O
. O
They O
all O
came O
back O
to O
her O

the O
pleasant O

the O
kind O

, O
the O

the O
long O
pains O
and O
trials O
that O
had O
since O
cast O
her O
down O

She O
thought O
of O
these O
and O
of O
the O
man O
who O
had O
been O
her O
constant O
protector O
, O
her O
good O

but O
the O
little O
bustle O
and O
holiday O
of O
the O
journey O
pleased O
and O
excited O
her O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
particularly O
happy O
. O
“ O
What O
a O
heavenly O
day O
! O
” O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
said O
, O

added O

with O
great O
originality O
, O
“ O
I O
hope O
we O
shall O
have O
a O
calm O
passage O

” O
Jos S-PERSON
waved O
his O
hand O
, O
scornfully O
glancing O
at O
the O

time O
under O
his O
eyelids O
at O
the O

. O
“ O
If O
you O
had O
made O
the O
voyages O

have O

” O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
you O
wouldn’t O
much O
care O
about O
the O
weather O

” O
But O
nevertheless O
, O
traveller O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
passed O
the O
night O
direfully O
sick O
in O
his O
carriage O
, O
where O
his O
courier O
tended O
him O
with O
brandy O

- O
water O

every O
luxury O
. O
In O
due O
time O
this O
happy O

landed O
at O
the O

they O
were O
transported O
by O
another O

Here O
the O
carriage O
and O
the O
family O
took O
to O
the O
shore O
, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
was O
not O
a O
little O
gratified O
to O
see O
his O

It O
was O
with O
great O
difficulty O
that O
he O

be O
restrained O
from O

To O
lay O
down O
the O

and O
even O
to O
think O
of O
that O

At O
this O
time O
of O

evening O

the O

trooping O
down O

Jos S-PERSON
used O
to O
go O

good O
deal O
with O
his O
bandanna O
over O
his O

and O
whether O
he O
woke O

slept O
his O
friends O
did O
not O
very O
much O
miss O
him O
. O
Yes O
, O
they O
were O
very O
happy O
. O
They O
went O
to O
the O

often O
of O
evenings O
— O
to O
those O

unassuming O

His O
Transparency O

, O
all O
very O
fat O
and O
good O

natured O
, O
come O
and O
occupy O
the O
great O
box O
in O
the O
middle O

and O
the O
pit O

elegant O
slim O

and O
twopence O
a O

day O
on O
full O

Here O
it O
was O
that O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
found O
her O
delight O
, O
and O
was O
introduced O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
to O
the O
wonders O
of O
Mozart S-PERSON
and O
Cimarosa S-PERSON
. O
The O
Major’s S-NORP
musical O
taste O
has O
been O
before O
alluded O
to O
, O
and O
his O
performances O
on O
the O
flute O
commended O
. O
But O
perhaps O
the O
chief O
pleasure O
he O
had O
in O
these O
operas O
was O
in O
watching O
Emmy’s S-PERSON
rapture O
while O
listening O
to O
them O
. O
A O
new O
world O
of O
love O
and O
beauty O
broke O
upon O
her O
when O
she O
was O
introduced O
to O
those O
divine O
compositions O
: O
this O
lady O
had O
the O
keenest O
and O
finest O
sensibility O
, O
and O
how O
could O
she O
be O
indifferent O
when O
she O
heard O
Mozart S-PERSON
? O
The O
tender O
parts O
of O
“ O
Don B-WORK_OF_ART
Juan E-WORK_OF_ART
” O
awakened O
in O
her O
raptures O
so O
exquisite O
that O
she O
would O
ask O
herself O
when O
she O
went O
to O
say O
her O
prayers O
of O
a O
night O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
not O
wicked O
to O
feel O
so O
much O
delight O
as O
that O
with O
which O
“ O
Vedrai B-PERSON
Carino E-PERSON
” O
and O
“ O
Batti B-WORK_OF_ART
Batti E-WORK_OF_ART
” O
filled O
her O
gentle O
little O
bosom O
? O
But O
the O
Major O
, O
whom O
she O
consulted O
upon O
this O
head O
, O
as O
her O
theological O
adviser O
( O
and O
who O
himself O
had O
a O
pious O
and O
reverent O
soul O
) O
, O
said O
that O
for O
his O
part O
, O
every O
beauty O
of O
art O
or O
nature O
made O
him O
thankful O
as O
well O
as O
happy O
| | O
and O
that O
the O
pleasure O
to O
be O
had O
in O
listening O
to O
fine O
music O
, O
as O
in O
looking O
at O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
or O
at O
a O
beautiful O
landscape O
or O
picture O
, O
was O
a O
benefit O
for O
which O
we O
might O
thank O
Heaven O
as O
sincerely O
as O
for O
any O
other O
worldly O
blessing O
. O
And O
in O
reply O
to O
some O
faint O
objections O
of O
Mrs. O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
( O
taken O
from O
certain O
theological O
works O

the O
“ O

which O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
had O
been O
furnished O
during O
her O
life O
at O
Brompton S-GPE
) O
he O
told O
her O
an O
Eastern S-NORP
fable O
of O
the O
Owl O
who O
thought O
that O
the O
sunshine O
was O
unbearable O
for O
the O
eyes O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Nightingale S-PERSON
was O
a O
most O
overrated O
bird O
. O
“ O
It O
is O
one’s O
nature O
to O
sing O
and O
the O
other’s O
to O
hoot O
, O
” O
he O
said O
, O
laughing O
, O
“ O
and O
with O
such O
a O
sweet O
voice O
as O
you O
have O
yourself O
, O
you O
must O
belong O
to O
the O
Bulbul S-NORP
faction O
. O
” O
I O
like O
to O
dwell O
upon O
this O
period O
of O
her O
life O
, O
and O
to O
think O
that O
she O
was O
cheerful O
and O
happy O
. O
You O
see O
she O
has O
not O
had O
too O
much O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
existence O
as O
yet O
, O
and O
has O
not O
fallen O
in O
the O
way O
of O
means O
to O
educate O
her O
tastes O
or O
her O
intelligence O
. O
She O
has O
been O
domineered O
over O
hitherto O
by O
vulgar O
intellects O
. O
It O
is O
the O
lot O
of O
many O
a O
woman O
. O
And O
as O
every O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
dear O
sex O
is O
the O
rival O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
kind O
, O
timidity O
passes O
for O
folly O
in O
their O
charitable O
judgments O
| | O
and O
gentleness O
for O
dulness O

and O
silence O
— O
which O
is O
but O
timid O
denial O
of O
the O
unwelcome O
assertion O
of O
ruling O
folks O
, O
and O
tacit O
protestantism O
— O
above O
all O
, O
finds O
no O
mercy O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
female O
Inquisition O
. O
Thus O
, O
my O
dear O
and O
civilised O
reader O
, O
if O
you O
and O
I O
were O
to O
find O
ourselves O
this O
evening O
in O
a O
society O
of O
greengrocers O

let O
us O
say O

it O
is O
probable O
that O
our O
conversation O
would O
not O
be O
brilliant O

if O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O

a O
greengrocer O
should O
find O
himself O
at O
your O
refined O

polite O
tea-table O
, O
where O
everybody O
was O
saying O
witty O
things O

everybody O
of O
fashion O
and O
repute O
tearing O
her O
friends O
to O
pieces O
in O
the O
most O
delightful O
manner O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
stranger O
would O
not O
be O
very O
talkative O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
interesting O

interested O

And O
it O
must O
be O
remembered O
, O
that O
this O
poor O

had O
never O
met O
a O
gentleman O
in O
her O
life O
until O
this O
present O
moment O
. O
Perhaps O
these O
are O
rarer O
personages O
than O
some O
of O
us O
think O
for O
. O
Which O
of O
us O
can O
point O
out O
many O
such O
in O
his O
circle O
— O
men O
whose O
aims O
are O
generous O
, O
whose O
truth O
is O
constant O
, O
and O
not O
only O
constant O
in O
its O
kind O
but O
elevated O
in O
its O
degree O
: O
whose O
want O
of O
meanness O
makes O
them O
simple O
: O
who O
can O
look O
the O
world O
honestly O
in O
the O
face O
with O
an O
equal O
manly O
sympathy O
for O
the O
great O
and O
the O
small O
? O
We O
all O
know O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
whose O
coats O
are O
very O
well O
made O
, O
and O
a O
score O
who O
have O
excellent O
manners O
, O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
happy O
beings O
who O
are O
what O
they O
call O
, O
in O
the O
inner O
circles O
, O
and O
have O
shot O
into O
the O
very O
centre O
and O
bull’s O
eye O
of O
the O
fashion O
| | O
but O
of O
gentlemen O
how O
many O
? O
Let O
us O
take O
a O
little O
scrap O
of O
paper O
and O
each O
make O
out O
his O
list O
. O
My O
friend O
the O
Major O
I O
write O
, O
without O
any O
doubt O
, O
in O
mine O
. O
He O
had O
very O
long O
legs O
, O
a O
yellow O
face O
, O
and O
a O
slight O
lisp O
, O
which O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
was O
rather O
ridiculous O
. O
But O
his O
thoughts O
were O
just O
, O
his O
brains O
were O
fairly O
good O
, O
his O
life O
was O
honest O
and O
pure O
, O
and O
his O
heart O
warm O
and O
humble O
. O
He O
certainly O
had O
very O
large O
hands O
and O
feet O
, O
which O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
George B-PERSON
Osbornes E-PERSON
used O
to O
caricature O
and O
laugh O
at O
| | O
and O
their O
jeers O
and O
laughter O
perhaps O
led O
poor O
little O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
astray O
as O
to O
his O
worth O
. O
But O
have O
we O
not O
all O
been O
misled O
about O
our O
heroes O
, O
and O
changed O
our O
opinions O
a O
hundred S-CARDINAL
times O
? O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
in O
this O
happy O
time O
, O
found O
that O
hers O
underwent O
a O
very O
great O
change O
in O
respect O
of O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
Major O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
the O
happiest O
time O
of O
both O
their O
lives O
indeed O
, O
if O
they O
did O
but O
know O
it O
— O
and O
who O
does O
? O
Which O
of O
us O
can O
point O
out O
and O
say O
that O
was O
the O
culmination O
— O
that O
was O
the O
summit O
of O
human O
joy O
? O
But O
at O
all O
events O
, O
this O
couple O
were O
very O
decently O
contented O
, O
and O
enjoyed O
as O
pleasant O
a O
summer O
tour O
as O
any O
pair O
that O
left O
England S-GPE
that B-DATE

Georgy S-PERSON
was O
always O
present O
at O
the O

but O
it O
was O
the O
Major O
who O
put O
Emmy’s S-PERSON
shawl O
on O
after O
the O
entertainment O

and O
in O
the O
walks O

the O
young O

be O

up O

the O

the O

Everybody O
remarked O
the O
majesty O

the O

the O

ordered O
for O

The O
little O

, O
we O
observed O

had O
a O
famous O

a O

did O
honour O
to O
his O
nation O

After O
about B-CARDINAL
fifteen E-CARDINAL
dishes O

he O
concluded O
the O
repast O

some O

even O
carried O
out O

some O
young O

amused O
with O
his O
coolness O

gallant O
free O
and O
easy O
manner O
, O
induced O
him O
to O
pocket O
a O
handful O

which O
he O
discussed O
on O

everybody O
went O

The O

shy O

remember O
joked O
the O

with O
a O
great O

grave O
fun O

pointing O
out O
dishes O

him O

From O
our O

the O
magnificent O

music O
produced O
upon O

heard O
the O
stout O

During O
the O
astonishing O

over O

the O
delightful O
voice O
of O
the O

rose O

soared O
in O
the O
most O
ravishing O
harmony O

the O
English S-LANGUAGE
lady’s O
face O
wore O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
wonder O

delight O
that O
it O
struck O
even O
little O
Fipps S-PERSON

the O
blasé O

drawled O
out O

her O

Every O

snivelling O
at O
the O
time O

I O

night O

open O
twice O
a O
week O
, O
the O
Court S-ORG
graciously O
received O
once O

so O
that O
a O

life O

in O

be O
a O
perfect O
round O
of O
pleasure O

the O
unpretending O
Pumpernickel S-PRODUCT

That O
there O
were O
feuds O
in O
the O
place O
, O
no O
one O
can O
deny O
. O
Politics O
ran O
very O
high O
at O
Pumpernickel S-ORG
, O
and O
parties O
were O
very O
bitter O
. O
There O
was O
the O
Strumpff S-PERSON
faction O

the O
Lederlung S-PERSON
party O
, O
the O
one O
supported O
by O
our O

by O

French S-NORP
Chargé O

, O
M. B-PERSON

Macabau E-PERSON

Indeed O
it O
sufficed O
for O
our O
Minister O
to O
stand O
up O
for O
Madame B-PERSON
Strumpff E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
clearly O
the O
greater O
singer O

the O
two S-CARDINAL

had O
three S-CARDINAL

her O

Madame B-PERSON
Lederlung E-PERSON
, O
her O
rival O
— O
it O
sufficed O
, O
I O
say O
, O
for O
our O
Minister O
to O
advance O
any O
opinion O
to O
have O
it O
instantly O
contradicted O
by O
the O
French S-NORP
diplomatist O
. O
Everybody O
in O
the O
town O
was O
ranged O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
other O
of O
these O
factions O
. O
The O
Lederlung S-PERSON
was O
a O
prettyish O
little O
creature O
certainly O
, O
and O
her O
voice O
( O
what O
there O
was O
of O
it O
, O
) O
was O
very O
sweet O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
Strumpff S-PERSON
was O
not O
in O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
youth O

beauty O
, O
and O
certainly O
too O
stout O

the O
last O

her O
night O
- O
chemise O
with O
a O
lamp O
in O
her O
hand O

and O
had O
to O
go O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
and O
pass O
over O
the O
plank O
of O
the O
mill O
, O
it O
was O
all O
she O
could O
do O
to O
squeeze O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
and O
the O
plank O
used O
to O
bend O
and O
creak O
again O
under O
her O
weight O
— O
but O
how O
she O
poured O
out O
the O
finale O
of O
the O
opera O

with O
what O
a O
burst O
of O
feeling O
she O
rushed O
into O
Elvino’s S-PERSON

— O
almost O
fit O
to O
smother O
him O

Whereas O

little O

— O

a O
truce O
to O
this O
gossip O

the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
these O

with O
a O
black O

on O

through O
the O

her O

only O
ventured O
her O

in O

followed O
each O

under O
the O

cried O
out O
with O

the O
winning O
colour O

She O
gave O
a O
sigh O

a O
shrug O

her O
shoulders O

thrumming O
it O
for O
a O
while O

Then O
she O
looked O
round O
her O

and O
saw O
Georgy’s S-PERSON
honest O
face O
staring O
at O
the O
scene O

The O
little O
scamp O
! O
what O

When O
she O
saw O
the O
boy O

at O

face O
she O
looked O
hard O
through O
her O
shining O
eyes O

mask O
, O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
Monsieur B-WORK_OF_ART

“ O
Non O

Madame S-PERSON

said O
the O
boy O
: O
but O
she O
must O
have O
known O
, O
from O
his O
accent O
, O
of O
what O
country O
he O
was O
, O
for O
she O
answered O
him O
with O
a O
slight O
foreign O
tone O
. O
“ O
You O

“ O
What O

said O
Georgy S-PERSON

blushing O
again O

Mr. O

was O
at O
work O
for O
his O

at O
the O

did O
not O

“ O

And O
she O
took O
from O
her O
bosom O
a O
purse O
, O
and O
out O
of O
it O
a O
gold O
piece O
, O
the O
only O

there O
, O
and O
she O
put O
it O
into O
George’s O
hand O
. O
The O
boy O
laughed O
, O
and O
did O
as O
he O
was O
bid O
. O
The O
number O
came O
up O
sure O
enough O
. O
There O
is O
a O
power O
that O
arranges O
that O

they O
say O

for O

“ O

she O

pulling O
the O
money O
towards O
her O

“ O

is O
your O

” O
“ O
My O
name’s O
Osborne S-PERSON

” O
said O
Georgy S-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
fingering O
in O
his O
own O
pockets O
for O
dollars O
, O
and O
just O
about O
to O
make O
a O
trial O
, O
when O
the O
Major O

in O
his O

, O
and O
Jos S-PERSON

en B-PERSON
Marquis E-PERSON

made O
their O
appearance O

Other O
people O
finding O
the O

stupid O
, O
and O
preferring O
the O
fun O
at O
the O
Stadthaus S-PERSON
, O
had O
quitted O
the O
Palace O
ball O
earlier O

but O
it O
is O
probable O
the O
Major O
and O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
gone O
home O
and O
found O
the O
boy’s O
absence O
, O
for O
the O
former O
instantly O
went O
up O
to O
him O
, O
and O
taking O
him O
by O
the O
shoulder O
, O
pulled O
him O
briskly O
back O
from O
the O
place O
of O
temptation O
. O
Then O
, O
looking O
around O
the O
room O
, O
he O
saw O
Kirsch S-PERSON
employed O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O
and O
going O
up O
to O
him O
, O
asked O
how O
he O
dared O
to O
bring O
Mr. O
George S-PERSON
to O
such O
a O
place O
. O
“ O
Laissez B-WORK_OF_ART

” O
said O
Mr. O
Kirsch S-PERSON
, O
very O
much O
excited O
by O

wine O

“ O

” O
Seeing O
his O
condition O
the O
Major O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
argue O
with O
the O
man O

but O
contented O
himself O
with O
drawing O
away O
George S-PERSON
, O
and O
asking O
Jos S-PERSON
if O
he O
would O
come O
away O
. O
He O
was O
standing O
close O
by O
the O
lady O
in O
the O
mask O
, O
who O
was O
playing O
with O
pretty O
good O
luck O
now O

and O
looking O
on O
much O
interested O
at O
the O
game O
. O
“ O
Hadn’t O
you O
better O
come O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
” O
the O
Major O
said O
, O
“ O
with O
George S-PERSON

me O
? O
” O
“ O
I’ll O
stop O

go O
home O
with O
that O
rascal O
, O
Kirsch S-PERSON
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
said O

and O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
of O
modesty O
, O
which O
he O
thought O
ought O
to O
be O
preserved O
before O
the O
boy O
, O
Dobbin S-PERSON
did O
not O
care O
to O
remonstrate O
with O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
but O
left O
him O
and O
walked O
home O
with O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Did O
you O
play O
? O
” O
asked O
the O
Major O
, O
when O
they O
were O
out O
, O
and O
on O
their O
way O
home O
. O
The O
boy O
said O
“ O
No O

” O
“ O
Give O
me O
your O
word O
of O
honour O
as O
a O

that O
you O

” O
“ O
Why O
? O
” O
said O
the O
boy O
: O
“ O
It O
seems O
very O
good O
fun O

” O
And O
, O
in O
a O
very O
eloquent O
and O
impressive O
manner O
, O
the O
Major O
showed O
him O
why O
he O
shouldn’t O
, O
and O
would O
have O
enforced O
his O
precepts O
by O
the O
example O
of O
Georgy’s S-PERSON
own O
father O
, O
had O
he O
liked O
to O
say O
anything O
that O
should O
reflect O
on O
the O
other’s O
memory O

When O
he O
had O
housed O
him O
he O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
saw O
his O
light O
, O
in O
the O
little O
room O
outside O
of O
Amelia’s S-GPE

presently O

Amelia’s S-PERSON
followed O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour E-TIME
afterwards O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
made O
the O
Major O
note O
it O
so O
accurately O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
remained O
behind O
, O
over O
the O
play O

table O

was O
no O
gambler O

not O
averse O
to O
the O
little O
excitement O
of O
the O
sport O
now O
and O
then O

and O
he O
had O
some O
Napoleons S-NORP
chinking O
in O
the O
embroidered O
pockets O
of O
his O
court O
waistcoat O
. O
He O
put O
down O
one O
over O
the O
fair O
shoulder O
of O
the O
little O
gambler O
before O
him O
, O

they O
won O

She O
made O
a O
little O
movement O
to O
make O
room O
for O
him O
by O
her O
side O
, O

just O
took O
the O
skirt O
of O
her O
gown O
from O
a O
vacant O
chair O
there O
. O
“ O
Come O

give O
me O
good O
luck O

she O
said O
, O
still O
in O
a O
foreign O
accent O
, O
quite O
different O
from O
that O
frank O
and O
perfectly O
English S-LANGUAGE
“ O

” O
with O
which O
she O
had O
saluted O

in O
her O
favour O

The O
portly O

that O
nobody O

him O

down O

“ O
Do O

the O

over O
a O
part O
of O
Mrs. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Crawley’s E-PERSON
biography O
with O
that O
lightness O

delicacy O
which O
the O
world O
demands O
— O
the O
moral O
world O
, O
that O
has O
, O
perhaps O
, O
no O
particular O
objection O
to O
vice O

but O
an O
insuperable O
repugnance O
to O
hearing O
vice O
called O
by O
its O
proper O
name O

There O
are O
things O
we O

know O
perfectly O
well O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair E-ORG
, O
though O
we O
never O
speak O
of O
them O

as O
the O
Ahrimanians S-NORP
worship O
the O

don’t O
mention O
him O

no O

bear O
to O
read O
an O
authentic O

a O
truly O

refined O
English S-LANGUAGE

before O
our O

every O

us O

If O

what O

It O
is O
only O
when O
their O

out O

any O

all O
through O

deferentially O

I O
defy O

some O

once O
forgotten O
the O
laws O

No O

Those O

peep O
down O

has O
not O
everything O
been O
proper O

decorous O

any O

most O
squeamish O

Fair E-ORG
a O
right O
to O

When O
, O
however O

the O
syren O
disappears O
and O
dives O
below O

down O
among O
the O
dead O
men O
, O
the O
water O
of O
course O
grows O
turbid O
over O
her O

and O
it O
is O
labour O
lost O
to O
look O
into O
it O
ever O
so O
curiously O
. O
They O
look O
pretty O
enough O
when O
they O
sit O
upon O
a O
rock O
, O
twanging O
their O
harps O
and O
combing O
their O
hair O

sing O
, O

beckon O
to O
you O
to O
come O
and O
hold O
the O
looking O
- O
glass O

but O
when O
they O
sink O
into O
their O
native O
element O
, O
depend O
on O
it O
those O
mermaids O
are O
about O
no O
good O
, O
and O
we O
had O
best O
not O
examine O
the O
fiendish O
marine O
cannibals O
, O
revelling O
and O
feasting O
on O
their O
wretched O
pickled O
victims O
. O
And O
so O
, O
when O
Becky S-PERSON
is O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
be O
sure O
that O
she O
is O
not O
particularly O
well O
employed O
, O
and O
that O
the O
less O
that O
is O
said O
about O
her O
doings O
is O
in O
fact O
the O
better O
. O
If O
we O
were O
to O
give O
a O
full O
account O
of O
her O
proceedings O
during O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
years E-DATE
that O
followed O
after O
the O
Curzon B-FAC
Street E-FAC
catastrophe O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
reason O
for O
people O
to O
say O
this O
book O
was O
improper O

The O
actions O
of O
very O
vain O
, O
heartless O
, O
pleasure O
- O
seeking O
people O
are O
very O
often O
improper O
( O
as O
are O
many O
of O

my O

with O
the O
grave O
face O

spotless O
reputation O

but O
that O
is O
merely O
by O
the O
way O

and O
what O
are O
those O
of O
a O
woman O
without O
faith O
— O
or O
love O
— O
or O
character O
? O
And O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
there O
was O
a O
period O
in O
Mrs. O
Becky’s S-PERSON
life O
, O
when O
she O
was O
seized O
, O
not O
by O
remorse O
, O
but O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
absolutely O
neglected O
her O
person O
, O
and O
did O
not O
even O
care O
for O
her O
reputation O
. O
This O
abattement O
and O
degradation O
did O
not O
take O
place O
all O
at O
once O
: O
it O
was O
brought O
about O
by O
degrees O
, O
after O
her O
calamity O
, O
and O
after O
many O
struggles O
to O
keep O
up O
— O
as O
a O
man O
who O
goes O
overboard O
hangs O
on O
to O
a O
spar O
whilst O
any O
hope O
is O
left O
, O
and O
then O
flings O
it O
away O
and O
goes O
down O
, O
when O
he O
finds O
that O
struggling O
is O
in O
vain O
. O
She O
lingered O
about O
London S-GPE
whilst O
her O
husband O
was O
making O
preparations O
for O
his O
departure O
to O
his O
seat O
of O
government O
: O
and O
it O
is O
believed O
made O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one E-CARDINAL
attempt O
to O
see O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
and O
to O
work O
upon O
his O
feelings O
, O
which O
she O
had O
almost O
enlisted O
in O
her O
favour O
. O
As O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Wenham S-PERSON
were O
walking O
down O
to O
the B-FAC
House I-FAC
of I-FAC
Commons E-FAC
, O
the O
latter O
spied O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
in O
a O
black O
veil O
, O
and O
lurking O
near O
the O
palace O
of O
the O
legislature O
. O
She O
sneaked O
away O
when O
her O
eyes O
met O
those O
of O
Wenham S-PERSON
, O
and O
indeed O
never O
succeeded O
in O
her O
designs O
upon O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
. O
Probably O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane E-PERSON
interposed O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
she O
quite O
astonished O
her O
husband O
by O
the O
spirit O
which O
she O
exhibited O
in O
this O
quarrel O
, O
and O
her O
determination O
to O
disown O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
Of O
her O
own O
movement O
, O
she O
invited O
Rawdon S-PERSON
to O
come O
and O
stop O
in O
Gaunt B-FAC
Street E-FAC
until O
his O
departure O
for O
Coventry B-GPE
Island E-GPE
, O
knowing O
that O
with O
him O
for O
a O
guard O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
would O
not O
try O
to O
force O
her O
door O
: O
and O
she O
looked O
curiously O
at O
the O
superscriptions O
of O
all O
the O
letters O
which O
arrived O
for O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
lest O
he O
and O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
should O
be O
corresponding O
. O
Not O
but O
that O
Rebecca S-PERSON
could O
have O
written O
had O
she O
a O
mind O
: O
but O
she O
did O
not O
try O
to O
see O
or O
to O
write O
to O
Pitt S-PERSON
at O
his O
own O
house O
, O
and O
after O
one S-CARDINAL
or O
two S-CARDINAL
attempts O
consented O
to O
his O
demand O
that O
the O
correspondence O
regarding O
her O
conjugal O
differences O
should O
be O
carried O
on O
by O
lawyers O
only O
. O
The O
fact O
was O
, O
that O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
mind O
had O
been O
poisoned O
against O
her O
. O
A O
short O
time O
after O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
accident O
Wenham S-PERSON
had O
been O
with O
the O
Baronet S-PERSON
| | O
and O
given O
him O
such O
a O
biography O
of O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
as O
had O
astonished O
the O
member O
for O
Queens B-GPE
Crawley E-GPE
. O
He O
knew O
everything O
regarding O
her O
: O
who O
her O
father O
was O

in O
what O
year O
her O
mother O
danced O
at O
the O
Opera O

what O
had O
been O
her O
previous O
history O
, O
and O
what O
her O
conduct O
during O
her O
married O
life O
: O
— O
as O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
the O
story O
was O
false O
and O
dictated O
by O
interested O
malevolence O
, O
it O
shall O
not O
be O
repeated O
here O
. O
But O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
left O
with O
a O
sad O
, O
sad O
reputation O
in O
the O
esteem O
of O
a O
country O
gentleman O
and O
relative O
who O
had O
been O
once O
rather O
partial O
to O
her O

The O

of O

But O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Wenham’s S-PERSON
business O
, O
Lord O
Steyne’s S-PERSON
business O
, O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON

everybody’s O
— O
to O
get O
her O
out O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
hush O
up O
a O
most O
disagreeable O
affair O
. O
She O
was O
probably O
so O
much O
occupied O
in O
arranging O
these O
affairs O
of O
business O
with O
her O
husband’s O
lawyers O
, O
that O
she O
forgot O
to O
take O
any O
step O
whatever O
about O
her O
son O
, O
the O
little O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
and O
did O
not O
even O
once O
propose O
to O
go O
and O
see O
him O
. O
That O
young O
gentleman O
was O
consigned O
to O
the O
entire O
guardianship O
of O
his O
aunt O
and O
uncle O
, O
the O
former O
of O
whom O
had O
always O
possessed O
a O
great O
share O
of O
the O
child’s O
affection O
. O
His O
mamma O
wrote O
him O
a O
neat O
letter O
from O
Boulogne S-PERSON
when O
she O
quitted O
England S-GPE
, O
in O
which O
she O
requested O
him O
to O
mind O
his O
book O
, O
and O
said O
she O
was O
going O
to O
take O
a O
Continental S-ORG
tour O
, O
during O
which O
she O
would O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
writing O
to O
him O
again O
. O
But O
she O
never O
did O
for O
a O
year O
afterwards O
, O
and O
not O
, O
indeed O
, O
until O
Sir O
Pitt’s S-PERSON
only O
boy O
, O
always O
sickly O
, O
died O
of O
whooping O
- O
cough O
and O
measles O

— O
then O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
mamma O
wrote O
the O
most O
affectionate O
composition O
to O
her O
darling O
son O
, O
who O
was O
made O
heir O
of O
Queen’s B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
by O
this O
accident O
, O
and O
drawn O
more O
closely O
than O
ever O
to O
the O
kind O
lady O
, O
whose O
tender O
heart O
had O
already O
adopted O
him O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
, O
then O
grown O
a O
tall O
, O
fine O
lad O
, O
blushed O
when O
he O
got O
the O
letter O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Aunt O
Jane S-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
my O
mother O

” O
he O
said O
“ O
and O
not O
— O
and O
not O
that O
one O
. O
” O
But O
he O
wrote O
back O
a O
kind O
and O
respectful O
letter O
to O
Mrs. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
then O
living O
at O
a O
boarding O

at O
Florence S-GPE

— O
But O
we O
are O
advancing O
matters O
. O
Our O
darling O
Becky’s S-PERSON
first S-ORDINAL
flight O
was O
not O
very O
far O
. O
She O
perched O
upon O
the O
French S-NORP
coast O
at O
Boulogne S-GPE
, O
that O
refuge O
of O
so O
much O
exiled O
English S-LANGUAGE
innocence O

and O
there O
lived O
in O
rather O
a O
genteel O
, O
widowed O
manner O
, O
with O
a O
feeme O
de O
chambre O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
rooms O
, O
at O
an O
hotel O
. O
She O
dined O
at O
the O
table O
d‘hôte O
, O
where O
people O
thought O
her O
very O
pleasant O
, O
and O
where O
she O
entertained O
her O
neighbours O
by O
stories O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
Sir O
Pitt S-PERSON
, O
and O
her O
great O
London S-GPE
acquaintance O

talking O
that O
easy O
, O
fashionable O
slipslop O
, O
which O
has O
so O
much O
effect O
upon O
certain O
folks O
of O
small O
breeding O
. O
She O
passed O
with O
many O
of O
them O
for O
a O
person O
of O
importance O
| | O
she O
gave O
little O
tea-parties O
in O
her O
private O
room O
, O
and O
shared O
in O
the O
innocent O
amusements O
of O
the O
place O
, O
— O
in O
sea-bathing O
, O
and O
in O
jaunts O
in O
open O
carriages O
, O
in O
strolls O
on O
the O
sands O
, O
and O
in O
visits O
to O
the O
play O
. O
Mrs. O
Burjoice S-PERSON
, O
the O
printer’s O
lady O
, O
who O
was O
boarding O
with O
her O
family O
at O
the O
hotel O
for O
the O
summer O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
her O
Burjoice S-PERSON
came O
of O
a O
Saturday S-DATE
and O
Sunday S-DATE
, O
voted O
her O
charming O
, O
until O
that O
little O
rogue O
of O
a O
Burjoice S-PERSON
began O
to O
pay O
her O
too O
much O
attention O
. O
But O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
the O
story O
, O
only O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
always O
affable O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
good O
- O
natured O
— O
and O
with O
men O
especially O
. O
Numbers O
of O
people O
were O
going O
abroad O
as O
usual O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
season O
, O
and O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
plenty O
of O
opportunities O
of O
finding O
out O
by O
the O
behaviour O
of O
her O
acquaintances O
of O
the O
great O
London S-GPE
world O
the O
opinion O
of O
“ O
society O
” O
as O
regarded O
her O
conduct O
. O
One S-CARDINAL
day O
it O
was O
Lady B-PERSON
Partlet E-PERSON
and O
her O
daughters O
whom O
Becky S-PERSON
confronted O
as O
she O
was O
walking O
modestly O
on O
Boulogne B-FAC
pier E-FAC
, O
the O
cliffs O
of O
Albion S-GPE
shining O
in O
the O
distance O
across O
the O
deep O
blue O
sea O
. O
Lady O
Partlet S-PERSON
marshalled O
all O
her O
daughters O
round O
her O
with O
a O
sweep O
of O
her O
parasol O
, O
and O
retreated O
from O
the O
pier O
darting O
savage O
glances O
at O
poor O
little O
Becky S-PERSON
who O
stood O
alone O
there O
. O
On O
another B-DATE
day E-DATE
the O
packet O
came O
in O
. O
It O
had O
been O
blowing O
fresh O
, O
and O
it O
always O
suited O
Becky’s S-PERSON
humour O
to O
see O
the O
droll O
woe O
- O
begone O
faces O
of O
the O
people O
as O
they O
emerged O
from O
the O
boat O
. O
Lady O
Slingstone S-PERSON
happened O
to O
be O
on O
board O
this B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
Her O
ladyship O
had O
been O
exceedingly O
ill O
in O
her O
carriage O
, O
and O
was O
greatly O
exhausted O
and O
scarcely O
fit O
to O
walk O
up O
the O
plank O
from O
the O
ship O
to O
the O
pier O
. O
But O
all O
her O
energies O
rallied O
the O
instant O
she O
saw O
Becky S-PERSON
smiling O
roguishly O
under O
a O
pink O
bonnet O
: O
and O
giving O
her O
a O
glance O
of O
scorn O
, O
such O
as O
would O
have O
shrivelled O
up O
most O
women O
, O
she O
walked O
into O
the B-FAC
Custom I-FAC
House E-FAC
quite O
unsupported O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
only O
laughed O
: O
but O
I O
don’t O
think O
she O
liked O
it O
. O
She O
felt O
she O
was O
alone O
, O
quite O
alone O
: O
and O
the O
far O
- O
off O
shining O
cliffs O
of O
England S-GPE
were O
impassable O
to O
her O
. O
The O
behaviour O
of O
the O
men O
had O
undergone O
, O
too O
, O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
change O
. O
Grinstone S-PERSON
showed O
his O
teeth O
and O
laughed O
in O
her O
face O
with O
a O
familiarity O
that O
was O
not O
pleasant O
. O
Little O
Bob B-PERSON
Suckling E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
cap O
in O
hand O
to O
her O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
before E-DATE
, O
and O
would O
walk O
a O
mile O
in O
the O
rain O
to O
see O
for O
her O
carriage O
in O
the O
line O
at O
Gaunt B-FAC
House E-FAC
, O
was O
talking O
to O
Fitzoof S-PERSON
of O
the O
Guards O
( O
Lord O
Heehaw’s S-PERSON
son O
) O
one O
day O
upon O
the O
jetty O
, O
as O
Becky S-PERSON
took O
her O
walk O
there O
. O
Little O
Bobby S-PERSON
nodded O
to O
her O
over O
his O
shoulder O
, O
without O
moving O
his O
hat O
, O
and O
continued O
his O
conversation O
with O
the O
heir O
of O
Heehaw S-PERSON
. O
Tom B-PERSON
Raikes E-PERSON
tried O
to O
walk O
into O
her O
sitting O
- O
room O
at O
the O
inn O
with O
a O
cigar O
in O
his O
mouth O
| | O
but O
she O
closed O
the O
door O
upon O
him O
and O
would O
have O
locked O
it O
only O
that O
his O
fingers O
were O
inside O
. O
She O
began O
to O
feel O
that O
she O
was O
very O
lonely O
indeed O
. O
“ O
If O
he’d O
been O
here O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
those O
cowards O
would O
never O
have O
dared O
to O
insult O
me O
. O
” O
She O
thought O
about O
“ O
him O
” O
with O
great O
sadness O
, O
and O
perhaps O
longing O
— O
about O
his O
honest O
, O
stupid O
, O
constant O
kindness O
and O
fidelity O
: O
his O
never O
- O
ceasing O
obedience O
| | O
his O
good O
humour O
| | O
his O
bravery O
and O
courage O
. O
Very O
likely O
she O
cried O
, O
for O
she O
was O
particularly O
lively O
, O
and O
had O
put O
on O
a O
little O
extra O
rouge O
when O
she O
came O
down O
to O
dinner O
. O
She O
rouged O
regularly O
now O
: O
and O
— O
and O
her O
maid O
got O
Cognac S-PERSON
for O
her O
besides O
that O
which O
was O
charged O
in O
the O
hotel O
bill O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
insults O
of O
the O
men O
were O
not O
, O
however O
, O
so O
intolerable O
to O
her O
as O
the O
sympathy O
of O
certain O
women O
. O
Mrs. O
Crackenbury S-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Washington S-PERSON
White S-PERSON
passed O
through O
Boulogne S-GPE
on O
their O
way O
to O
Switzerland S-GPE
. O
( O
The O
party O
were O
protected O
by O
Colonel O
Horner S-PERSON
, O
young O
Beaumoris S-PERSON
, O
and O
of O
course O
old O
Crackenbury S-PERSON
, O
and O
Mrs. O
White’s S-PERSON
little O
girl O
. O
) O
They O
did O
not O
avoid O
her O
. O
They O
giggled O
, O
cackled O
, O
tattled O
, O
condoled O
, O
consoled O
, O
and O
patronised O
her O
until O
they O
drove O
her O
almost O
wild O
with O
rage O
. O
To O
be O
patronised O
by O
them O
! O
she O
thought O
, O
as O
they O
went O
away O
simpering O
after O
kissing O
her O
. O
And O
she O
heard O
Beaumoris’s S-PERSON
laugh O
ringing O
on O
the O
stair O
, O
and O
knew O
quite O
well O
how O
to O
interpret O
his O
hilarity O
. O
It O
was O
after O
this O
visit O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
paid O
her O
weekly S-DATE
bills O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
who O
had O
made O
herself O
agreeable O
to O
every O
body O
in O
the O
house O
, O
who O
smiled O
at O
the O
landlady O
, O
called O
the O
waiters O
“ O
Monsieur S-PERSON
, O
” O
and O
paid O
the O
chambermaids O
in O
politeness O
and O
apologies O
, O
what O
far O
more O
than O
compensated O
for O
a O
little O
niggardliness O
in O
point O
of O
money O
( O
of O
which O
Becky S-PERSON
never O
was O
free O
) O
, O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
we O
say O
, O
received O
a O
notice O
to O
quit O
from O
the O
landlord O
, O
who O
had O
been O
told O
by O
some O
one O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
an O
unfit O
person O
to O
have O
at O
his O
hotel O
, O
where O
English S-LANGUAGE
ladies O
would O
not O
sit O
down O
with O
her O
. O
And O
she O
was O
forced O
to O
fly O
into O
lodgings O
, O
of O
which O
the O
dulness O
and O
solitude O
were O
most O
wearisome O
to O
her O
. O
Still O
she O
held O
up O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
these O
rebuffs O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
make O
a O
character O
for O
herself O
, O
and O
conquer O
scandal O
. O
She O
went O
to O
church O
very O
regularly O
, O
and O
sang O
louder O
than O
anybody O
there O
. O
She O
took O
up O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
widows O
of O
the O
shipwrecked O
fishermen O
, O
and O
gave O
work O
and O
drawings O
for O
the B-ORG
Quashyboo I-ORG
Mission E-ORG
| | O
she O
subscribed O
to O
the O
Assembly S-ORG
and O
wouldn’t O
waltz O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
she O
did O
everything O
that O
was O
respectable O
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
we O
dwell O
upon O
this O
part O
of O
her O
career O
with O
more O
fondness O
than O
upon O
subsequent O
parts O
of O
her O
history O
, O
which O
are O
not O
so O
pleasant O
. O
She O
saw O
people O
avoiding O
her O
, O
and O
still O
laboriously O
smiled O
upon O
them O
| | O
you O
never O
could O
suppose O
from O
her O
countenance O
what O
pangs O
of O
humiliation O
she O
might O
be O
enduring O
inwardly O
. O
Her O
history O
was O
after O
all O
a O
mystery O
. O
Parties O
were O
divided O
about O
her O
. O
Some O
people O
, O
who O
took O
the O
trouble O
to O
busy O
themselves O
in O
the O
matter O
, O
said O
that O
she O
was O
the O
criminal O

whilst O
others O
vowed O
that O
she O
was O
as O
innocent O
as O
a O
lamb O
, O

Mrs. O

her O
up O
at O
one S-CARDINAL

these O

— O
a O
woman O
without O

a O

Mrs. O

heard O

not O
? O
— O
some O
of O
the O

Steyne S-PERSON
affair O

but O
after O
a O
conversation O
with O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
she O
pronounced O
that O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
an O
angel O
, O
her O
husband O
a O
ruffian O
, O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON
an O
unprincipled O
wretch O
, O
as O
everybody O
knew O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
case O
against O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
an O
infamous O

wicked O
conspiracy O
of O
that O
rascal O
Wenham S-PERSON

“ O
If O
you O
were O
a O
man O
of O
any O
spirit O
, O
Mr. O

, O
you O
would O
box O
the O
wretch’s O
ears O
the O
next O
time O
you O
see O
him O
at O
the O
Club S-ORG
, O
” O
she O
said O
to O
her O
husband O
. O
But O
Eagles S-ORG
was O
only O
a O
quiet O
old O
gentleman O
, O
husband O
to O
Mrs. O
Eagles S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
taste O
for O
geology O
, O
and O
not O
tall O
enough O
to O
reach O
anybody’s O
ears O
. O
Mrs. O
Eagles S-PERSON
then O
patronised O
Mrs. O
Rawdon S-PERSON
, O
took O
her O
to O
live O
with O
her O
at O
her O
own O
house O
at O
Paris S-GPE
, O
quarrelled O
with O
the O
ambassador’s O
wife O
because O
she O
would O
not O
receive O
her O
protégée O
, O
and O
did O
all O
that O
lay O
in O
woman’s O
power O
to O
keep O
Becky S-PERSON
straight O
in O
the O
paths O
of O
virtue O
and O
good O
repute O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
very O
respectable O
and O
orderly O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
, O
but O
the O
life O
of O
humdrum O
virtue O
grew O
utterly O
tedious O
to O
her O
before O
long O
. O
It O
was O
the O
same O
routine O
every O
day O
, O
the O
same O
dulness O
and O
comfort O
, O
the O
same O
drive O
over O
the O
same O
stupid O
Bois B-FAC
de I-FAC
Boulogne E-FAC
, O
the O
same O
company O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
the O
same O
Blair’s B-WORK_OF_ART
Sermon E-WORK_OF_ART
of O
a O
Sunday S-DATE
night O
— O
the O
same O
opera O
always O
being O
acted O
over O
and O
over O
again O
: O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
dying O
of O
weariness O
, O
when O
, O
luckily O
for O
her O
, O
young O
Mr. O
Eagles S-PERSON
came O
from O
Cambridge S-GPE
, O
and O
his O
mother O
, O
seeing O
the O
impression O
which O
her O
little O
friend O
made O
upon O
him O
, O
straightaway O
gave O
Becky S-PERSON
warning O
. O
Then O
she O
tried O
keeping O
house O
with O
a O
female O
friend O
| | O
then O
the O
double O
ménage O
began O
to O
quarrel O
and O
get O
into O
debt O
. O
Then O
she O
determined O
upon O
a O
boarding O
- O
house O
existence O
, O
and O
lived O
for O
some O
time O
at O
that O
famous O
mansion O
kept O
by O
Madame B-WORK_OF_ART

in O
the B-FAC
Rue I-FAC
Royale E-FAC
, O
at O
Paris S-GPE
, O
where O
she O
began O
exercising O
her O
graces O
and O
fascinations O
upon O
the O
shabby O
dandies O
and O
fly O
- O
blown O
beauties O
who O
frequented O
her O
landlady’s O
salons O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
loved O
society O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
could O
no O
more O
exist O
without O
it O
than O
an O
opium O
- O
eater O
without O
his O
dram O
, O
and O
she O
was O
happy O
enough O
at O
the O
period O
of O
her O
boarding O
- O
house O
life O
. O
“ O
The O
women O
here O
are O
as O
amusing O
as O
those O
in O

” O
she O
told O
an O
old O
London S-GPE
friend O
who O
met O
her O
— O
“ O
only O
, O
their O

not O
quite O
so O
fresh O

The O
men O
wear O
cleaned O
gloves O
, O
and O
are O
sad O
rogues O
, O
certainly O
, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
worse O
than O
Jack B-PERSON
This E-PERSON
, O
and O
Tom B-PERSON
That E-PERSON
. O
The O
mistress O
of O
the O
house O
is O
a O
little O
vulgar O
, O
but O
I O
don’t O
think O
she O
is O
so O
vulgar O
as O
Lady O
— O
— O
” O
and O
here O
she O
named O
the O
name O
of O
a O
great O
leader O
of O
fashion O
that O
I O
would O
die O
rather O
than O
reveal O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
when O
you O
saw O
Madame B-FAC
de I-FAC
Saint I-FAC
Amour’s E-FAC
rooms O
lighted O
up O
of O
a O
night O
, O
men O
with O
plaques O
and O
cordons O
at O
the O
écarté O
tables O
, O
and O
the O
women O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
, O
you O
might O
fancy O
yourself O
for O
a O
while O
in O
good O
society O
, O
and O
that O
Madame S-PERSON
was O
a O
real O
Countess O
. O
Many O
people O
did O
so O
fancy O
: O
and O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
for O
a O
while O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dashing O
ladies O
of O
the O
Countess’s S-ORG
salons O
. O
But O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
her O
old O
creditors O
of O
1815 S-DATE
found O
her O
out O
and O
caused O
her O
to O
leave O
Paris S-GPE

for O
the O
poor O
little O
woman O
was O
forced O
to O
fly O
from O
the O
city O
rather O
suddenly O

and O
went O
thence O
to O
Brussels S-GPE

How O
well O
she O
remembered O
the O
place O
! O
She O
grinned O
as O
she O
looked O
up O
at O
the O
little O
entresol O
which O
she O
had O
occupied O
and O
thought O
of O
the O
Bareacres S-PERSON
family O
, O
bawling O
for O
horses O
and O
flight O
, O
as O
their O
carriage O
stood O
in O
the O
porte O

cochére O
of O
the O

She O
went O
to O
Waterloo S-GPE

to O
Laeken S-GPE
, O
where O
George B-PERSON
Osborne’s E-PERSON
monument O
much O
struck O
her O
. O
She O
made O
a O
little O
sketch O
of O
it O
. O
“ O
That O
poor O
Cupid O

” O
she O
said O

“ O
how O
dreadfully O

was O
in O

what O
a O
fool O
he O
was O

I O
wonder O
whether O

was O

red O
whiskers O
were O
dyed O
of O
a O
purple O

which O
made O
his O
pale O

look O
still O
paler O
. O
He O
wore O
his O
collar O
and O
orders O
, O
his O
blue O
ribbon O

garter O
. O
He O
was O
a O
greater O

there O

a O

how O
vulgar O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
did O
Major O

appear O
to O
her O

and O
how O
that O
odious O
Captain B-PERSON

did O
smell O
of O

! O
In O
one S-CARDINAL
instant O
she O
reassumed O
her O
fine O

“ O
That O

“ O

” O
A O
hundred S-CARDINAL
such O
touching O
hopes O

memories O
palpitated O
in O
her O

she O
looked O
with O
her O
brightest O
eyes O
( O
the O

up O

to O
put O

to O
look O

speak O
like O
a O
great O
prince O
, O
as O
he O
was O

Becky S-PERSON
admired O
him O
smilingly O
sumptuously O
, O
easy O
, O
lofty O

stately O

Ah O

she O
had O
exchanged O

reeking O
of O
cigars O

“ O

Lord O

talking O

laughing O
with O
a O
great O

illustrious O
lady O
at O
his O
side O
, O
when O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
all O
over O
in O
a O
flutter O
as O
their O
eyes O
met O
, O
and O
she O
put O
on O
the O
very O
best O
smile O
she O
could O
muster O
, O
and O
dropped O
him O
a O
little O
timid O
, O
imploring O
curtsey O
. O
He O
stared O
aghast O
at O
her O
for O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
as O
Macbeth S-PERSON

on O

remained O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
open O
mouth O
, O
when O
that O
horrid O
Major O
Loder S-PERSON
pulled O
her O
away O

“ O

away O

was O
that O

go O

try O
the O
old O
governor’s O
champagne O

” O
Becky S-PERSON
thought O
the O
Major O
had O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
much O
already O

The O
day O

possibly O
in O
hopes O
to O
have O
another O
sight O
of O
Lord O
Steyne S-PERSON

But O
she O
met O
another O
acquaintance O
there O
: O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Fiche S-PERSON
, O
his O
lordship’s O
confidential O
man O

who O
came O
up O
nodding O
to O
her O
rather O
familiarly O
, O
and O
putting O
a O
finger O
to O
his O
hat O
. O
“ O
I O
knew O
that O
Madame S-PERSON

here O

he O
said O

“ O

Becky S-PERSON
asked O
, O
resuming O
as O
much O
of O
her O
dignity O
as O
she O
could O
muster O
, O

not O
a O
little O
agitated O
by O

“ O

fury O

“ O

soiled O

marked O
here O

there O
with O
pomatum O

but O
her O
arms O
shone O
out O
from O
the O
loose O
sleeves O
of O
the O
dress O
very O
white O
and O
fair O
, O
and O
it O
was O
tied O
round O
her O
little O
waist O
, O
so O
as O
not O
ill O
to O
set O
off O
the O
trim O
little O
figure O
of O
the O
wearer O
. O
She O
led O
Jos S-PERSON
by O
the O
hand O
into O
her O
garret O
. O
“ O
Come O
in O
, O
” O
she O
said O

“ O
Come O
, O

talk O
to O
me O

Sit O
yonder O
on O
the O
chair O

and O
she O
gave O
the O
Civilian’s O
hand O
a O
little O
squeeze O
, O
and O
laughingly O
placed O
him O
upon O
it O
. O
As O
for O
herself O
, O
she O
placed O
herself O
on O
the O
bed O

not O
on O
the O
bottle O

you O
may O
be O
sure O

on O
which O
Jos S-PERSON
might O
have O
reposed O
, O
had O
he O
chosen O
that O
seat O

and O
so O
there O
she O
sate O
and O
talked O
with O
her O
old O
admirer O
. O
“ O
How O
little O
years O
have O
changed O
you O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
tender O
interest O
. O
“ O
I O
should O
have O
known O
you O
anywhere O

What O

it O
is O

once O

The O
frank O
honest O
face O
, O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
bore O
any O
expression O

one O
of O
openness O

honesty O
: O
it O
was O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
much O
perturbed O
and O
puzzled O
in O
look O

Jos S-PERSON
was O
surveying O
the O
queer O
little O
apartment O
in O

he O
found O
his O
old O
flame O

the O

with O
a O
candle O

not O
of O

Becky S-PERSON
thought O
of O
popping O
that O
into O
the O
bed O
, O
too O
, O
but O
she O
only O
put O
in O
the O
little O
paper O
night O

she O
had O
put O

“ O

“ O

her O

put O
her O

her O

up O

much O
grief O

Max S-PERSON

at O

wonder O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky’s S-PERSON
sobs O

cries O

Jos S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
a O
good O

affected O
at O
seeing O
his O
old O
flame O

And O
she O
began O
, O
forthwith O
, O
to O
tell O
her O
story O
— O
a O
tale O
so O
neat O
, O
simple O
, O
and O
artless O
, O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
evident O
from O
hearing O
her O
, O
that O
if O
ever O
there O
was O
a O
white O
- O
robed O
angel O
escaped O
from O
heaven O

be O
subject O
to O
the O
infernal O
machinations O

villainy O
of O
fiends O
here O

that O
spotless O
being O
— O
that O
miserable O
unsullied O
martyr O
, O

present O

bed O

sitting O
on O
the O
brandy O

had O
a O
very O
long O

amicable O

talk O
there O

the O
course O

, O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
was O
somehow O
made O
aware O
( O

in O
a O
manner O
that O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
scare O
or O
offend O
him O
) O
that O
Becky’s S-PERSON
heart O
had O
first S-ORDINAL
learned O
to O
beat O
at O
his O
enchanting O
presence O
: O
that O
George B-PERSON
Osborne E-PERSON
had O
certainly O
paid O
an O
unjustifiable O
court O
to O
her O
, O
which O
might O
account O
for O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
jealousy O
, O
and O
their O
little O
rupture O
| | O
but O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
never O
gave O
the O
least O
encouragement O
to O
the O
unfortunate O
officer O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
never O
ceased O
to O
think O
about O
Jos S-PERSON
from O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
day O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
, O
though O
, O
of O
course O
, O
her O
duties O
as O
a O
married O
woman O
were O
paramount O
— O
duties O
which O
she O
had O
always O
preserved O
, O
and O
would O
, O
to O
her O
dying O
day O
, O
or O
until O
the O
proverbially O
bad O
climate O
in O
which O
Colonel O
Crawley S-PERSON
was O
living O
should O
release O
her O
from O
a O
yoke O
which O
his O
cruelty O
had O
rendered O
odious O
to O
her O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
went O
away O
, O
convinced O
that O
she O
was O
the O
most O
virtuous O
, O
as O
she O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
fascinating O
of O
women O
, O
and O
revolving O
in O
his O
mind O
all O
sorts O
of O
benevolent O
schemes O
for O
her O
welfare O
. O
Her O
persecutions O
ought O
to O
be O
ended O
: O
she O
ought O
to O
return O
to O
the O
society O
of O
which O
she O
was O
an O
ornament O
. O
He O
would O
see O
what O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
. O
She O
must O
quit O
that O
place O
, O
and O
take O
a O
quiet O
lodging O
. O
Amelia S-PERSON
must O
come O
and O
see O
her O
, O
and O
befriend O
her O
. O
He O
would O
go O
and O
settle O
about O
it O
, O
and O
consult O
with O
the O
Major O
. O
She O
wept O
tears O
of O
heartfelt O
gratitude O
as O
she O
parted O
from O
him O
, O
and O
pressed O
his O
hand O
as O
the O
gallant O
stout O
gentleman O
stooped O
down O
to O
kiss O
hers O
. O
So O
Becky S-PERSON
bowed O
Jos S-PERSON
out O
of O
her O
little O
garret O
with O
as O
much O
grace O
as O
if O
it O
was O
a O
palace O
of O
which O
she O
did O
the O
honours O
| | O
and O
that O
heavy O
gentleman O
having O
disappeared O
down O
the O
stairs O
, O
Max S-PERSON
and O
Fritz S-PERSON
came O
out O
of O
their O
hole O
, O
pipe O
in O
mouth O
, O
and O
she O
amused O
herself O
by O
mimicking O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
them O
as O
she O
munched O
her O
cold O
bread O
and O
sausage O
and O
took O
draughts O
of O
her O
favourite O
brandy O
- O
and O
- O
water O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
walked O
over O
to O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
lodgings O
with O
great O
solemnity O
, O
and O
there O
imparted O
to O
him O
the O
affecting O
history O
with O
which O
he O
had O
just O
been O
made O
acquainted O
, O
without O
, O
however O
, O
mentioning O
the O
play O
- O
business O
of O
the O
night O
before O
. O
And O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
were O
laying O
their O
heads O
together O
, O
and O
consulting O
as O
to O
the O
best O
means O
of O
being O
useful O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
was O
finishing O
her O
interrupted O
déjeuner O
à O
la O
fourchette O
. O
How O
was O
it O
that O
she O
had O
come O
to O
that O
little O
town O
? O
How O
was O
it O
that O
she O
had O
no O
friends O
and O
was O
wandering O
about O
alone O
? O
Little O
boys O
at O
school O
are O
taught O
in O
their O
earliest O
Latin S-NORP
book O
, O
that O
the O
path O
of O
Avernus O
is O
very O
easy O
of O
descent O
. O
Let O
us O
skip O
over O
the O
interval O
in O
the O
history O
of O
her O
downward O
progress O
. O
She O
was O
not O
worse O
now O
than O
she O
had O
been O
in O
the O
days O
of O
her O
prosperity O
: O
— O
only O
a O
little O
down O
on O
her O
luck O
. O
As O
for O
Mrs. O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
a O
woman O
of O
such O
a O
soft O
and O
foolish O
disposition O
, O
that O
when O
she O
heard O
of O
anybody O
unhappy O
, O
her O
heart O
straightway O
melted O
towards O
the O
sufferer O
| | O
and O
as O
she O
had O
never O
thought O
or O
done O
anything O
mortally O
guilty O
herself O
, O
she O
had O
not O
that O
abhorrence O
for O
wickedness O
which O
distinguishes O
moralists O
much O
more O
knowing O
. O
If O
she O
spoiled O
everybody O
who O
came O
near O
her O
with O
kindness O
and O
compliments O
, O
— O
if O
she O
begged O
pardon O
of O
all O
her O
servants O
for O
troubling O
them O
to O
answer O
the O
bell O
, O
— O
if O
she O
apologised O
to O
a O
shop O
- O
boy O
who O
showed O
her O
a O
piece O
of O
silk O
, O
or O
made O
a O
curtsey O
to O
a O
streetsweeper O
with O
a O
complimentary O
remark O
upon O
the O
elegant O
state O
of O
his O
crossing O
— O
and O
she O
was O
almost O
capable O
of O
every O
one O
of O
these O
follies O
— O
the O
notion O
that O
an O
old O
acquaintance O
was O
miserable O
was O
sure O
to O
soften O
her O
heart O
| | O
nor O
would O
she O
hear O
of O
anybody’s O
being O
deservedly O
unhappy O
. O
A O
world O
under O
such O
legislation O
as O
hers O
would O
not O
be O
a O
very O
orderly O
place O
of O
abode O

When O
the O
Major O
heard O
from O
Jos S-PERSON
of O
the O
sentimental O
adventure O

had O
just O

nearly O
as O
much O
interested O
as O
the O
gentleman O
from O
Bengal S-GPE
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
his O
excitement O
was O
quite O
the O
reverse O
from O
a O
pleasurable O
one O

he O
made O
use O
of O
a O
brief O

improper O
expression O
regarding O
a O
poor O
woman O
in O
distress O
, O
saying O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
— O
“ O
the O
little O
minx O

has O
she O
come O
to O
light O
again O

” O
He O
never O
had O
had O
the O
slightest O
liking O
for O
her O

but O
had O
heartily O
mistrusted O
her O
from O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
moment O
when O
her O
green O
eyes O
had O
looked O
at O

turned O
away O

his O
own O

“ O
That O
little O
devil O
brings O
mischief O
wherever O

goes O

” O
the O
Major O

disrespectfully O

“ O

confounded O

the O
way O

used O
to O
cheat O

hoodwink O

George S-PERSON

there O
a O
scandal O
about O

separation O

think O
I O
heard O
something O

cried O
out O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
care O
much O
about O
gossip O

and O
whom O
Jos S-PERSON
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
convince O
that O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
in O
all O
respects O
a O
most O
injured O
and O
virtuous O
female O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
well O

let’s O
ask O
Mrs. O
George S-PERSON
, O
” O
said O
that O
arch O
- O
diplomatist O
of O
a O
Major O
. O
“ O
Only O
let O
us O
go O
and O
consult O
her O

I O
suppose O
you O
will O
allow O
that O
she O
is O
a O
good O
judge O
at O
any O

knows O
what O

” O
“ O
Hm O
! O
Emmy O
is O
very O
well O

said O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
happen O
to O
be O
in O
love O
with O
his O
sister O

“ O
Very O

the O
finest O
lady O

ever O
met O

bounced O
out O
the O
Major O

“ O
I O
say O
at O
once O

let O
us O
go O

ask O
her O
if O
this O
woman O

I O
will O
be O
content O

her O
verdict O

” O
Now O
this O
odious O
, O
artful O
rogue O
of O
a O
Major O
was O
thinking O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
that O
he O
was O
sure O
of O
his O
case O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
, O
he O
remembered O
, O
was O
at O
one O
time O
cruelly O
and O
deservedly O
jealous O
of O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
never O
mentioned O
her O
name O

with O
a O
shrinking O
and O
terror O
— O
a O
jealous O
woman O
never O
forgives O
, O
thought O
Dobbin S-PERSON
: O
and O
so O
the O
pair O
went O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Mrs. O
George’s S-PERSON
house O
, O
where O
she O
was O
contentedly O
warbling O
at O
a O
music O
- O
lesson O
with O
Madame B-PERSON
Strumpff E-PERSON
. O
When O
that O
lady O
took O
her O
leave O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
opened O
the O
business O
with O
his O
usual O
pomp O
of O
words O
. O
“ O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O

said O
he O
, O
“ O

Major O

if O
you O
please O
not O

break O
my O

” O
The O
Major O
was O
twirling O
them O
round O
by O
the O
little O
chain O
from O
which O
they O
sometimes O
hung O
to O
their O
lady’s O
waist O
, O

was O
thereby O
endangering O
his O

“ O
It O

Amelia S-PERSON

blushing O

being O
very O
much O
agitated O

“ O
You O

right O

always O

Dobbin S-PERSON

, O
old O

old O

rushed O
back O
into O
Amelia’s O
gentle O
heart O

caused O
a O
cruel O
agitation O
there O
. O
“ O
Don’t O

me O
see O
her O

“ O
She O

very O
unhappy O

that O
sort O
of O

Jos S-PERSON
urged O

“ O
She O

“ O

on O

not O
undexterously O

so O
miserable O

She O
has O
been O
almost O
mad O

grief O

affected O

my O

cruel O
persecution O
borne O
so O
angelically O

I O
may O
say O

family O
has O
been O
most O
cruel O
to O
her O

” O
“ O
Poor O
creature O
! O

low O
tremulous O

This O
did O
not O
seem O

affect O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART

even O
smiled O
a O
little O
. O
Perhaps O
she O
figured O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
herself O
panting O
up O
the O
stair O

resumed O

“ O
The O
agonies O
that O

quite O
frightful O

Jos S-PERSON

was O
very O
fat O

easily O
moved O

perfect O
angel O

, O
perhaps O
not O
very O
willing O

ascend O

saw O

was O
as O
well O

at O

moment O

embraced O
her O

kissed O
her O
with O
all O
her O
heart O

Ah O

poor O
wretch O

when O
was O
your O
lip O

such O
pure O

FRANKNESS O

kindness O

Amelia’s O
were O
likely O
to O
touch O
even O
such O
a O
hardened O
little O
reprobate O
as O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
She O
returned O
Emmy’s S-PERSON
caresses O
and O
kind O
speeches O
with O
something O
very O
like O
gratitude O
, O
and O
an O
emotion O
which O
, O
if O
it O
was O
not O
lasting O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
was O
almost O
genuine O
. O
That O
was O
a O
lucky O
stroke O
of O
hers O
about O
the O
child O
“ O
torn O
from O
her O
arms O
shrieking O
. O
” O
It O
was O
by O
that O
harrowing O
misfortune O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
won O
her O
friend O
back O
, O
and O
it O
was O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
first S-ORDINAL
points O
, O
we O
may O
be O
certain O
, O
upon O
which O
our O
poor O
simple O
little O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
began O
to O
talk O
to O
her O
new O
- O
found O
acquaintance O
. O
“ O
And O
so O
they O
took O
your O
darling O
child O
from O
you O
? O
” O
our O
simpleton O
cried O
out O
. O
“ O
Oh O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
my O
poor O
dear O
suffering O
friend O
, O
I O
know O
what O
it O
is O
to O
lose O
a O
boy O
, O
and O
to O
feel O
for O
those O
who O
have O
lost O
one O
. O
But O
please O
Heaven O
yours O
will O
be O
restored O
to O
you O

“ O
The O
child O

my O
child O
? O
Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
my O
agonies O
were O
frightful O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
owned O
, O
not O
perhaps O
without O
a O
twinge O
of O
conscience O
. O
It O
jarred O
upon O
her O
, O
to O
be O
obliged O
to O
commence O
instantly O
to O
tell O
lies O
in O
reply O
to O
so O
much O
confidence O
and O
simplicity O
. O
But O
that O
is O
the O
misfortune O
of O
beginning O
with O
this O
kind O
of O
forgery O
. O
When O
one S-CARDINAL
fib O
becomes O
due O
as O
it O
were O
, O
you O
must O
forge O
another O
to O
take O
up O
the O
old O
acceptance O

and O
so O
the O
stock O
of O
your O
lies O
in O
circulation O
inevitably O
multiplies O
, O
and O
the O
danger O
of O
detection O
increases O
every O
day O
. O
“ O
My O
agonies O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
continued O
, O
“ O
were O
terrible O
( O
I O
hope O
she O
won’t O
sit O
down O

when O

took O
him O
away O

thought O
I O
should O
die O

I O
fortunately O

“ O

is O
he O
? O
” O
Emmy S-PERSON
asked O
. O
“ O
Eleven S-CARDINAL

said O
Becky S-PERSON

“ O

cried O
the O

“ O

Becky S-PERSON
cried O
out O
, O
who O
had O
in O
fact O
quite O
forgotten O
all O
about O
little O
Rawdon’s S-PERSON
age O

“ O

made O

“ O
Was O
he O
fair O

dark O

” O
went O
on O
that O
absurd O
little O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
“ O
Show O
me O
his O
hair O
. O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
almost O
laughed O
at O
her O
simplicity O
. O
“ O
Not O

I O
came O

a O
little O
drawing O
of O

I O
made O

days O

” O
“ O

“ O

how O
thankful O
I O
ought O

( O
though O
I O
doubt O
whether O
that O

inculcated O

better O
off O

else O
, O

a O
very O
rational O
religious O
exercise O

) O
and O
then O
she O
began O
to O
think O
as O
usual O
, O
how O
her O
son O
was O
the O
handsomest O
, O
the O
best O
, O
and O
the O
cleverest O
boy O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
. O
“ O
You O
will O
see O
my O
Georgy S-PERSON
, O
” O
was O
the O
best O
thing O
Emmy O
could O
think O
of O
to O
console O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
If O
anything O
could O
make O
her O
comfortable O
that O
would O
. O
And O
so O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
women O
continued O
talking O
for O
an B-TIME
hour E-TIME
or O
more O
, O
during O
which O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
the O
opportunity O
of O
giving O
her O
new O
friend O
a O
full O
and O
complete O
version O
of O
her O
private O
history O
. O
She O
showed O
how O
her O
marriage O
with O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley E-PERSON
had O
always O
been O
viewed O
by O
the O
family O
with O
feelings O
of O
the O
utmost O
hostility O

how O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
( O
an O
artful O
woman O
) O
had O
poisoned O
her O
husband’s O
mind O
against O
her O
| | O
how O
he O
had O
formed O
odious O
connections O
, O
which O
had O
estranged O
his O
affections O
from O
her O
| | O
how O
she O
had O
borne O
everything O
— O
poverty O
, O
neglect O
, O
coldness O
, O
from O
the O
being O
whom O
she O
most O
loved O
— O
and O
all O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
her O
child O

how O
, O
finally O
, O
and O
by O
the O
most O
flagrant O
outrage O
, O
she O
had O
been O
driven O
into O
demanding O
a O
separation O
from O
her O
husband O
. O
When O
the O
wretch O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
ask O
that O
she O
should O
sacrifice O
her O
own O
fair O
fame O
so O
that O
he O
might O
procure O
advancement O
through O
the O
means O
of O
a O
very O
great O
and O
powerful O
but O
unprincipled O
man O
— O
the B-PERSON
Marquis I-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Steyne E-PERSON
, O
indeed O
. O
The O
atrocious O
monster O
! O
This O
part O
of O
her O
eventful O
history O
Becky S-PERSON
gave O
with O
the O
utmost O
feminine O
delicacy O
, O
and O
the O
most O
indignant O
virtue O
. O
Forced O
to O
fly O
her O
husband’s O
roof O
by O
this O
insult O
, O
the O
coward O
had O
pursued O
his O
revenge O
by O
taking O
her O
child O
from O
her O
. O
And O
thus O
Becky S-PERSON
said O
she O
was O
a O
wanderer O
, O
poor O
, O
unprotected O
, O
friendless O
, O
and O
wretched O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
received O
this O
story O
, O
which O
was O
told O
at O
some O
length O
, O
as O
those O
persons O
who O
are O
acquainted O
with O
her O
character O
may O
imagine O
that O
she O
would O
. O
She O
quivered O
with O
indignation O
at O
the O
account O
of O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
miserable O
Rawdon S-PERSON
and O
the O
unprincipled O
Steyne S-PERSON
. O
Her O
eyes O
made O
notes O
of O
admiration O
for O
every O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
sentences O
in O
which O
Becky S-PERSON
described O
the O
persecutions O
of O
her O
aristocratic O
relatives O
, O
and O
the O
falling O
away O
of O
her O
husband O
. O
( O
Becky S-PERSON
did O
not O
abuse O
him O
. O
She O
spoke O
rather O
in O
sorrow O
than O
in O
anger O
. O
She O
had O
loved O
him O
only O
too O
fondly O
: O
and O
was O
he O
not O
the O
father O
of O
her O
boy O

child O

while O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
reciting O
it O
, O
Emmy S-PERSON
retired O
altogether O
behind O
her O
pocket O
- O
handkerchief O
, O
so O
that O
the O
consummate O
little O
tragedian O
must O
have O
been O
charmed O
to O
see O
the O
effect O
which O
her O
performance O
produced O
on O
her O
audience O

Whilst O
the O

found O
himself O

tired O

about O

narrow O

took O
out O

sate O
down O

could O
not O
help O
hearing O
somewhat O

It O
was O
mainly O
about O

The O
Major O

who O
had O
seen O
the O
key O
of O
No.90 O
put O
up O
on O
its O
hook O
, O

had O
heard O
the O
conversation O
of O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
young O
University S-ORG
bloods O
, O
was O
not O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
understand O
that O

talk O
related O

Becky S-PERSON
. O
“ O
The O
little O
devil O
is O
at O
her O
old O
tricks O

” O
he O
thought O
, O
and O
he O
smiled O
as O
he O
recalled O
old O
days O
, O
when O
he O
had O
witnessed O
the O
desperate O
flirtation O
with O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
ludicrous O
end O
of O
that O
adventure O
. O
He O
and O
George S-PERSON
had O
often O
laughed O
over O
it O
subsequently O
, O
and O
until O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
after O
George’s S-PERSON
marriage O
, O
when O
he O
also O
was O
caught O
in O
the O
little O
Circe’s S-PERSON
toils O
, O
and O
had O
an O
understanding O
with O
her O
which O
his O
comrade O
certainly O
suspected O
, O
but O
preferred O
to O
ignore O
. O
William S-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
hurt O
or O
ashamed O
to O
ask O
to O
fathom O
that O
disgraceful O
mystery O
, O
although O
once O
, O
and O
evidently O
with O
remorse O
on O
his O
mind O
, O
George S-PERSON
had O
alluded O
to O
it O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
Waterloo S-GPE
, O
as O
the O
young O
men O
stood O
together O
in O
front O
of O
their O
line O
, O
surveying O
the O
black O
masses O
of O
Frenchmen S-NORP
who O
crowned O
the O
opposite O
heights O
, O
and O
as O
the O
rain O
was O
coming O
down O
, O
“ O
I O
have O
been O
mixing O
in O
a O
foolish O
intrigue O
with O
a O
woman O
, O
” O
George S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
I O
am O
glad O
we O
were O
marched O
away O
. O
If O
I O
drop O
, O
I O
hope O
Emmy O
will O
never O
know O
of O
that O
business O

I O
wish O
to O
God O
it O
had O
never O
been O
begun O
! O
” O
And O
William S-PERSON
was O
pleased O
to O
think O
, O
and O
had O
more O
than O
once O
soothed O
poor O
George’s S-PERSON
widow O
with O
the O
narrative O
, O
that O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
after O
quitting O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
after O
the O
action O
of O
Quatre B-ORG
Bras E-ORG
, O
on O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day E-DATE
, O
spoke O
gravely O
and O
affectionately O
to O
his O
comrade O
of O
his O
father O
and O
his O
wife O
. O
On O
these O
facts O
, O
too O
, O
William S-PERSON
had O
insisted O
very O
strongly O
in O
his O
conversations O
with O
the O
elder O
Osborne S-PERSON
: O
and O
had O
thus O
been O
the O
means O
of O
reconciling O
the O
old O
gentleman O
to O
his O
son’s O
memory O
, O
just O
at O
the O
close O
of O
the O
elder O
man’s O
life O
. O
“ O
And O
so O
this O
devil O
is O
still O
going O
on O
with O
her O
intrigues O
, O
” O
thought O
William S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
wish O
she O
were O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
miles E-QUANTITY
from O
here O
. O
She O
brings O
mischief O
wherever O
she O
goes O
. O
” O
And O
he O
was O
pursuing O
these O
forebodings O
and O
this O
uncomfortable O
train O
of O
thought O
, O
with O
his O
head O
between O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
the O
“ O

” O
of O
last B-DATE

unread O
under O
his O
nose O
, O
when O
somebody O
tapped O
his O
shoulder O
with O
a O
parasol O
, O
and O
he O
looked O
up O
and O
saw O
Mrs. O
Amelia S-PERSON
. O
This O
woman O
had O
a O
way O
of O
tyrannising O
over O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
( O
for O
the O
weakest O
of O
all O
people O

domineer O
over O
somebody O
) O
, O
and O
she O
ordered O
him O
about O
, O
and O
patted O
him O
, O
and O
made O
him O
fetch O
and O
carry O
just O
as O
if O
he O
was O
a O
great O
Newfoundland S-NORP
dog O
. O
He O
liked O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
to O
jump O
into O
the O
water O
if O
she O
said O
“ O
High O

” O
and O
to O
trot O
behind O
her O
with O
her O
reticule O
in O
his O
mouth O
. O
This O
history O
has O
been O
written O
to O
very O
little O
purpose O
if O
the O
reader O
has O
not O
perceived O
that O
the O
Major O
was O
a O
spooney O
. O
“ O
Why O
did O
you O
not O
wait O
for O
me O
, O
sir O

to O
escort O
me O
downstairs O

” O
she O
said O
, O
giving O
a O
little O
toss O
of O
her O
head O
, O
and O
a O
most O
sarcastic O
curtsey O
. O
“ O
I O
couldn’t O
stand O
up O
in O
the O
passage O
, O
” O
he O
answered O
, O
with O
a O
comical O
deprecatory O
look O

and O
, O
delighted O
to O
give O
her O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
to O
take O
her O
out O
of O
the O
horrid O
smoky O
place O
, O
he O
would O
have O
walked O
off O
without O
even O
so O
much O
as O
remembering O
the O
waiter O
, O
had O
not O
the O
young O
fellow O
run O
after O
him O
and O
stopped O
him O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O

to O
make O
him O
pay O
for O
the O
beer O

he O
had O
not O
consumed O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
laughed O
: O
she O
called O
him O
a O
naughty O
man O
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
run O
away O
in O
debt O
: O
and O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
made O
some O
jokes O
suitable O
to O
the O
occasion O

the O
small O

beer O
. O
She O
was O
in O
high O
spirits O

good O
humour O
, O

tripped O
across O
the O
market O

very O
briskly O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
see O
Jos S-PERSON
that O
instant O

The O
Major O
laughed O
at O
the O
impetuous O
affection O

exhibited O

for O
, O
in O
truth O

was O
not O
very O
often O

wanted O
her O

had O
been O
pacing O

looking O
over O

Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
closeted O
with O
her O
friend O
in O
the O
garret O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
was O
beating O
the O
tattoo O
on O
the O
sloppy O
tables O
of O
the O
public O

he O
was O
, O
on O
his O
side O

too O
, O
very O
anxious O
to O
see O
Mrs. O

“ O

said O

“ O
God O

Jos S-PERSON
said O
, O
wagging O
his O
head O
so O
that O
his O
cheeks O
quivered O
like O

Emmy O

a O
staid O
English S-LANGUAGE

to O
whom O
the O

paid O
court O

Georgy S-PERSON
used O
to O
“ O
lark O
” O
dreadfully O
with O
accounts O
of O
German S-NORP
robbers O

ghosts O

She O
passed O
her O
time O
chiefly O
in O
grumbling O

in O
ordering O
about O
her O

up O

a O
most O
majestic O
air O
, O
and O
shut O
her O
own O
door O
briskly O
on O
herself O
and O
her O
outraged O
dignity O
. O
“ O
To O
allude O
to O
that O
! O
” O
she O
said O
, O
when O
the O
door O
was O
closed O

“ O
Oh O
, O
it O
was O
cruel O
of O
him O
to O
remind O
me O
of O
it O
, O
” O
and O
she O
looked O
up O
at O
George’s S-PERSON
picture O
, O
which O
hung O
there O
as O
usual O
, O
with O
the O
portrait O
of O
the O
boy O
underneath O
. O
“ O
If O
was O
cruel O
of O
him O
. O
If O
I O
had O
forgiven O
it O
, O
ought O
he O
to O
have O
spoken O
? O
No O
. O
And O
it O
is O
from O
his O
own O
lips O
that O
I O
know O
how O
wicked O
and O
groundless O
my O
jealousy O
was O

and O
that O
you O
were O
pure O
— O
Oh O
yes O
, O
you O
were O
pure O
, O
my O
saint O
in O
heaven O
! O
” O
She O
paced O
the O
room O
trembling O
and O
indignant O
. O
She O
went O
and O
leaned O
on O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers O
over O
which O
the O
picture O
hung O
, O
and O
gazed O
and O
gazed O
at O
it O
. O
Its O
eyes O
seemed O
to O
look O
down O
on O
her O
with O
a O
reproach O
that O
deepened O
as O
she O
looked O
. O
The O
early O
dear O
, O
dear O
memories O
of O
that O
brief O
prime O
of O
love O
rushed O
back O
upon O
her O
. O
The O
wound O
which O
years O
had O
scarcely O
cicatrised O
bled O
afresh O
, O
and O
oh O
, O
how O
bitterly O
! O
She O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
reproaches O
of O
the O
husband O
there O
before O
her O
. O
It O
couldn’t O
be O
. O
Never O
, O
never O

That O
unlucky O
word O
had O
undone O
the O
work O

many O
a O
year O

the O
long O
laborious O
edifice O
of O
a O
life O

away O

by O

nevertheless O
continued O

implore O
Sedley S-PERSON
in O
the O
most O
energetic O
terms O

to O
beware O
of O
Rebecca S-PERSON

he O
eagerly O

adjured O

He O
besought O
Mr. O
Sedley S-PERSON
to O
inquire O
at O
least O
regarding O
her O
: O
told O
him O
how O

heard O
that O
she O
was O
in O
the O
company O
of O
gamblers O

people O
of O
ill O
repute O

pointed O
out O
what O
evil O
she O
had O
done O
in O
former O
days S-DATE

how O
she O

Crawley S-PERSON

misled O
poor O
George S-PERSON
into O
ruin O

how O
she O
was O
now O
parted O
from O
her O

by O
her O
own O
confession O

, O
perhaps O
, O
for O
good O

What O
a O

William S-PERSON

with O
all O
the O

might O
have O
succeeded O

his O
supplications O

the O
Civilian S-ORG
was O
not O
a O
little O
jealous O
of O
the O
airs O

superiority O

the O

constantly O
exhibited O

began O
a O
blustering O
speech O

his O
intention O

in O
fine O
, O
to O
rebel O
against O
the O
Major O

when O
the O
colloquy O
— O
rather O
a O
long O
and O
stormy O
one O
— O
was O
put O
an O
end O
to O
in O
the O
simplest O
way O
possible O
, O
namely O
, O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
porter O
from O
the B-FAC
Elephant I-FAC
Hotel E-FAC
, O
in O
charge O
of O
her O
very O
meagre O
baggage O
. O
She O
greeted O
her O
host O
with O
affectionate O
respect O
, O
and O
made O
a O
shrinking O
, O
but O
amicable O
, O
salutation O
to O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
as O
her O
instinct O
assured O
her O
at O
once O
, O
was O
her O
enemy O
, O
and O
had O
been O
speaking O
against O
her O
| | O
and O
the O
bustle O
and O
clatter O
consequent O
upon O
her O
arrival O
brought O
Amelia S-PERSON
out O
of O
her O
room O
. O
Emmy O
went O
up O
and O
embraced O
her O
guest O
with O
the O
greatest O
warmth O
, O
and O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
the O
Major O
, O
except O
to O
fling O
him O
an O
angry O
look O
— O
the O
most O
unjust O
and O
scornful O
glance O
that O
had O
perhaps O
ever O
appeared O
in O
that O
poor O
little O
woman’s O
face O
since O
she O
was O
born O
. O
But O
she O
had O
private O
reasons O
of O
her O
own O
, O
and O
was O
bent O
upon O
being O
angry O
with O
him O
. O
And O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
indignant O
at O
the O
injustice O
, O
not O
at O
the O
defeat O
, O
went O
off O
, O
making O
her O
a O
bow O
quite O
as O
haughty O
as O
the O
killing O
curtsey O
with O
which O
the O
little O
woman O
chose O
to O
bid O
him O
farewell O
. O
He O
being O
gone O
, O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
particularly O
lively O
and O
affectionate O
to O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
and O
bustled O
about O
the O
apartments O
and O
installed O
her O
guest O
in O
her O
room O
with O
an O
eagerness O
and O
activity O
seldom O
exhibited O
by O
our O
placid O
little O
friend O
. O
But O
when O
an O
act O
of O
injustice O
is O
to O
be O
done O
, O
especially O
by O
weak O
people O
, O
it O
is O
best O
that O
it O
should O
be O
done O
quickly O
| | O
and O
Emmy S-PERSON
thought O
she O
was O
displaying O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
firmness O
and O
proper O
feeling O
and O
veneration O
for O
the O
late O
Captain O
Osborne S-PERSON
in O
her O
present O
behaviour O
. O
Georgy S-PERSON
came O
in O
from O
the O
fêtes O
for O
dinner O
- O
time O
, O
and O
found O
four S-CARDINAL
covers O
laid O
as O
usual O
| | O
but O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
places O
was O
occupied O
by O
a O
lady O
, O
instead O
of O
by O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Hullo S-PERSON
! O
where’s O
Dob S-PERSON
? O
” O
the O
young O
gentleman O
asked O
, O
with O
his O
usual O
simplicity O
of O
language O
. O
“ O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
is O
dining O
out O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
” O
his O
mother O
said O
: O
and O
, O
drawing O
the O
boy O
to O
her O
, O
kissed O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
put O
his O
hair O
off O
his O
forehead O
, O
and O
introduced O
him O
to O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
. O
“ O
This O
is O
my O
boy O
, O
Rebecca S-PERSON
. O
” O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
said O
— O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
— O
can O
the O
world O
produce O
anything O
like O
that O
? O
Becky S-PERSON
looked O
at O
him O
with O
rapture O
, O
and O
pressed O
his O
hand O
fondly O
. O
“ O
Dear O
boy O
! O
” O
she O
said O
— O
“ O
he O
is O
just O
like O
my O
— O
— O
” O
Emotion O
choked O
her O
further O
utterance O
| | O
but O
Amelia S-PERSON
understood O
, O
as O
well O
as O
if O
she O
had O
spoken O
, O
that O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
thinking O
of O
her O
own O
blessed O
child O
. O
However O
, O
the O
company O
of O
her O
friend O
consoled O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
, O
and O
she O
ate O
a O
very O
good O
dinner O
. O
During O
the O
repast O
, O
she O
had O
occasion O
to O
speak O
several O
times O
, O
when O
Georgy S-PERSON
eyed O
her O
and O
listened O
to O
her O
. O
At O
the O
dessert O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
was O
gone O
out O
to O
superintend O
further O
domestic O
arrangements O

Jos S-PERSON
was O
in O
his O
great O
chair O
dozing O
over O
Galignanis B-PERSON
Georgy E-PERSON
and O
the O
new O
arrival O
sat O
close O
to O
each O
other O
: O
he O
had O
continued O
to O
look O
at O
her O
knowingly O
more O
than O
once O
, O
and O
at O
last O
, O
he O
laid O
down O
the O
nut O
- O
crackers O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
, O
” O
said O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
“ O
What O
do O
you O
say O
? O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
said O
, O
laughing O
. O
“ O
You’re O
the O
lady O

“ O

up O

“ O

“ O

good O

Becky S-PERSON

who O
now O
re-entered O

it O
must O
be O
owned O

unaware O

was O
in O

for O

walked O
about O

a O
history O
about O

heads O

yellow O
jackets O

swept O
the O

Pumpernickel S-PRODUCT

as O

to O
that O
little O
scapegrace O
Georgy S-PERSON
. O
This O
information O
astonished O
and O
horrified O
the O
Major O
not O
a O
little O
. O
It O
had O
been O
agreed O
in O
the O
morning O
( O
before O
meeting O
with O
Rebecca S-PERSON
) O
that O
Amelia S-PERSON
should O
go O
to O
the O
Court S-ORG
ball O
that O
night O
. O
There O
would O
be O
the O
place O
where O
he O
should O
tell O
her O
. O
The O
Major O
went O
home O
and O
dressed O
himself O
in O
his O
uniform O
, O
and O
repaired O
to O
Court S-ORG
, O
in O
hopes O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
. O
She O
never O
came O
. O
When O
he O
returned O
to O
his O
lodgings O
all O
the O
lights O
in O
the O
Sedley S-PERSON
tenement O
were O
put O
out O
. O
He O
could O
not O
see O
her O
till O
the O
morning O
. O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
night’s O
rest O
he O
had O
with O
this O
frightful O
secret O
in O
bed O
with O
him O
. O
At O
the B-TIME
earliest I-TIME
convenient I-TIME
hour E-TIME
in O
the O
morning O
he O
sent O
his O
servant O
across O
the O
way O
with O
a O
note O
, O
saying O
, O
that O
he O
wished O
very O
particularly O
to O
speak O
with O
her O
. O
A O
message O
came O
back O
to O
say O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
was O
exceedingly O
unwell O
, O
and O
was O
keeping O
her O
room O
. O
She O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
awake O
all O
that O
night O
. O
She O
had O
been O
thinking O
of O
a O
thing O
which O
had O
agitated O
her O
mind O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred E-CARDINAL
times O
before O
. O
A O
hundred S-CARDINAL
times O
on O
the O
point O
of O
yielding O
, O
she O
had O
shrunk O
back O
from O
a O
sacrifice O
which O
she O
felt O
was O
too O
much O
for O
her O
. O
She O
couldn’t O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
love O
and O
constancy O
, O
and O
her O
own O
acknowledged O
regard O
, O
respect O
, O
and O
gratitude O
. O
What O
are O
benefits O
, O
what O
is O
constancy O
, O
or O
merit O
? O
One S-CARDINAL

of O
a O
girl’s O
ringlet O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
hair O
of O
a O

, O
will O
turn O
the O
scale O
against O
them O
all O
in O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
. O
They O
did O
not O
weigh O
with O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
more O
than O
with O
other O
women O
. O
She O
had O
tried O
them O
| | O
wanted O
to O
make O
them O
pass O
| | O
could O
not O
| | O
and O
the O
pitiless O
little O
woman O
had O
found O
a O
pretext O
, O
and O
determined O
to O
be O
free O
. O
When O
at O
length O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
the O
Major O
gained O
admission O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
instead O
of O
the O
cordial O
and O
affectionate O
greeting O
, O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O
accustomed O
now O
for O
many O
a O
long O
day O
, O
he O
received O
the O
salutation O
of O
a O
curtsey O
, O
and O
of O
a O
little O
gloved O
hand O
, O
retracted O
the O
moment O
after O
it O
was O
accorded O
to O
him O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
was O
in O
the O
room O
, O
and O
advanced O
to O
meet O
him O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
an O
extended O
hand O
. O
Dobbin S-PERSON
drew O
back O
rather O
confusedly O
. O
“ O
I O
— O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
ma’am O
, O
” O
he O
said O
| | O
“ O
but O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
is O
not O

your O
friend O
that O
I O
am O
come O
here O
now O
. O
” O
“ O
Pooh O
! O
damn O

don’t O
let O
us O
have O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
! O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
cried O
out O
, O
alarmed O
, O
and O
anxious O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
a O
scene O
. O
“ O
I O
wonder O
what O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
has O
to O
say O
against O
Rebecca S-PERSON
? O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
said O
in O
a O
low O
, O
clear O
voice O
with O
a O
slight O
quiver O
in O
it O
, O
and O
a O
very O
determined O
look O
about O
the O
eyes O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
not O
have O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
in O
my O
house O
, O
” O
Jos S-PERSON
again O
interposed O
. O
“ O
I O
say O
I O
will O
not O
have O
it O
: O
and O
Dobbin S-PERSON
, O
I O
beg O
, O
sir O
, O
you’ll O
stop O
it O
. O
” O
And O
he O
looked O
round O
trembling O
and O
turning O
very O
red O
, O
and O
gave O
a O
great O
puff O
, O
and O
made O
for O
his O
door O
. O
“ O
Dear O
friend O
! O
” O
Rebecca S-PERSON
said O
with O
angelic O
sweetness O
, O
“ O
do O
hear O
what O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
has O
to O
say O
against O
me O

” O
“ O
I O
will O
not O
hear O
it O
, O
I O
say O
, O
” O
squeaked O
out O
Jos S-PERSON
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
voice O
, O
and O
, O
gathering O
up O
his O
dressing O
- O
gown O
, O
he O
was O
gone O
. O
“ O
We O
are O
only O
two S-CARDINAL
women O
, O
” O
Amelia S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
You O
can O
speak O
now O
, O
sir O
. O
” O
“ O
This O
manner O
towards O
me O
is O
one O
which O
scarcely O
becomes O
you O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
” O
the O
Major O
answered O
haughtily O
| | O
“ O
nor O
I O
believe O
am O
I O
guilty O
of O
habitual O
harshness O
to O

not O

said O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
more O
and O
more O
in O
a O
pet O
. O
The O
expression O
of O
Dobbin’s S-PERSON
face O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
in O
this O
imperious O
manner O
, O
was O
not O

“ O

out O

Amelia S-PERSON

silent O

broke O
the O

she O
held O
him O

was O
an O

played O
fairly O

“ O
Ah O

absolutely O
bethought O

wrote O
him O

him O

indeed O
, O
being O
by O
no O

so O
much O
interested O
about O
anybody’s O
welfare O
as O
about O
her O

she O
had O
a O
great O
number O
of O
things O
pertaining O
to O
herself O
to O
consider O
, O
and O
which O
concerned O
her O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
than O
Major O

happiness O
in O
this O

She O
found O
herself O
suddenly O
and O
unexpectedly O
in O
snug O
comfortable O
quarters O
: O
surrounded O
by O
friends O
, O
kindness O
, O
and O
good O
- O
natured O
simple O
people O
such O

she O

not O
met O
with O
for O
many O
a O
long O
day O

and O
, O
wanderer O
as O
she O
was O
by O
force O
and O
inclination O
, O
there O
were O
moments O
when O
rest O
was O
pleasant O
to O
her O
. O
As O
the O
most O
hardened O

careered O
across O

before O
he O
goes O
out O
again O
marauding O
, O
so O
Jos’s O
tents O
and O
pilau O
were O
pleasant O
to O
this O
little O
Ishmaelite O
. O
She O
picketed O
her O
steed O
, O
hung O
up O
her O
weapons O
, O
and O
warmed O
herself O

The O
halt O
in O
that O

restless O
life O
, O
was O
inexpressibly O
soothing O
and O
pleasant O
to O
her O
. O
So O
, O
pleased O
herself O
, O
she O
tried O
with O
all O
her O
might O
to O
please O
everybody O

and O
we O
know O
that O
she O
was O
eminent O

successful O
as O
a O

in O
the O
art O
of O
giving O
pleasure O

As O
for O

in O
the O

In O
the O

a O
week O

the O

was O
her O

He O
didn’t O
go O

his O
custom O
was O
, O
in O
the O
much O
less O
lively O

He O
drove O
out O
with O
Becky S-PERSON
in O
his O
open O

He O
asked O
little O

then O
came O

was O
quite O
forgotten O
when O
this O

The O

of O

Becky S-PERSON
soon O
discovered O
the O
way O
to O
soothe O

please O
her O
. O
She O
talked O
to O
her O
perpetually O
about O
Major O
Dobbin S-PERSON
sent O
about O
his O
business O

made O
no O
scruple O

as O
ever O
Becky S-PERSON
chose O
to O
praise O
him O

indeed O
brought O
the O

of O
times O

Having O
at O
first S-ORDINAL
disliked O
Becky S-PERSON
for O
being O
the O
means O
of O
dismissing O
him O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
her O
mistress O
, O
she O
was O
reconciled O
to O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
subsequently O
, O
because O
the O
latter O
became O
William’s S-PERSON
most O
ardent O
admirer O

champion O
. O
And O
in O
those O
nightly O
conclaves O

the O

Her O
advocacy O
did O
not O
make O
Amelia S-PERSON
angry O
any O
more O
than O
Rebecca’s S-PERSON
admiration O
of O
him O
. O
She O
made O
George S-PERSON
write O
to O
him O
constantly O

persisted O
in O
sending O
Mamma’s S-PERSON
kind O
love O

as O
she O

no O

reproached O
it O

how O
Georgy’s S-PERSON
father O
trusted O
him O
beyond O
all O
other O
men O
, O
and O
had O
been O
constantly O
befriended O
by O
the O
good O
William S-PERSON
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
when O
your O
papa O
was O
a O
little O
boy O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
“ O
he O
often O
told O
me O
that O
it O
was O
William S-PERSON
who O
defended O
him O
against O
a O
tyrant O
at O
the O
school O
where O
they O
were O
| | O
and O
their O
friendship O
never O
ceased O
from O
that O
day O
until O
the O
last O
, O
when O
your O
dear O
father O
fell O
. O
” O
“ O
Did O
Dobbin S-PERSON
kill O
the O
man O
who O
killed O
papa O
? O
” O
Georgy S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
I’m O
sure O
he O
did O
, O
or O
he O
would O
if O
he O
could O
have O
caught O
him O

wouldn’t O
he O
, O
mother O
? O
When O
I’m O
in O
the O
army O
, O
won’t O
I O
hate O
the O
French S-NORP
? O
— O
that’s O
all O
. O
” O
In O
such O
colloquies O
the O
mother O
and O
the O
child O
passed O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
their O
time O
together O
. O
The O
artless O
woman O
had O
made O
a O
confidante O
of O
the O
boy O
. O
He O
was O
as O
much O
William’s S-PERSON
friend O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
knew O
him O
well O
. O
By O
the O
way O
, O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
not O
to O
be O
behind O
- O
hand O
in O
sentiment O
, O
had O
got O
a O
miniature O
, O
too O
, O
hanging O
up O
in O
her O
room O
, O
to O
the O
surprise O
and O
amusement O
of O
most O
people O
, O
and O
the O
delight O
of O
the O
original O
, O
who O
was O
no O
other O
than O
our O
friend O
Jos S-PERSON
. O
On O
her O
first S-ORDINAL
coming O
to O
favour O
the O
Sedleys S-PERSON
with O
a O
visit O
, O
the O
little O
woman O
, O
who O
had O
arrived O
with O
a O
remarkably O
small O
shabby O
kit O
, O
was O
perhaps O
ashamed O
of O
the O
meanness O
of O
her O
trunks O
and O
band O
- O
boxes O
, O
and O
often O
spoke O
with O
great O
respect O
about O
her O
baggage O
left O
behind O
at O
Leipzig S-GPE
, O
which O
she O
must O
have O
from O
that O
city O
. O
When O
a O
traveller O
talks O
to O
you O
perpetually O
about O
the O
splendour O
of O
his O
luggage O

which O
he O
does O
not O
happen O
to O
have O
with O
him O

my O

beware O
of O
that O
traveller O
! O
He O
is O
, O
ten S-CARDINAL
to O
one O
, O
an O
impostor O
. O
Neither O
Jos S-PERSON
nor O
Emmy S-PERSON
knew O
this O
important O
maxim O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
them O
of O
no O
consequence O
whether O
Becky S-PERSON
had O
a O
quantity O
of O
very O
fine O
clothes O
in O
invisible O
trunks O

but O
as O
her O
present O
supply O
was O
exceedingly O
shabby O
, O
Emmy S-PERSON
supplied O
her O
out O
of O
her O
own O
stores O
, O
or O
took O
her O
to O
the O
best O
milliner O
in O
the O
town O
, O
and O
there O
fitted O
her O
out O

It O
was O
no O
more O
torn O

now O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
and O
faded O
silks O
trailing O
off O
at O
the O
shoulder O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
changed O
her O
habits O
with O
her O
situation O
in O
life O
— O
the O
rouge O
- O
pot O
was O
suspended O
— O
another O
excitement O
to O
which O
she O
had O
accustomed O
herself O
was O
also O
put O
aside O
, O
or O
at O
least O
only O
indulged O
in O
in O
privacy O

as O
when O
she O
was O
prevailed O
on O
by O
Jos S-PERSON

a O
summer O
evening O

take O
a O
little O
spirit O

But O
if O
she O
did O
not O
indulge O
— O
the O
courier O
did O
: O
that O
rascal O
Kirsch S-PERSON
could O
not O

kept O

could O
he O
tell O
how O
much O
he O
took O
when O
he O
applied O
to O
it O

He O
was O
sometimes O
surprised O
himself O
at O
the O
way O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Sedley’s B-PERSON
Cognac E-PERSON
diminished O
. O
Well O
, O
well O

this O
is O
a O
painful O
subject O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
did O
not O
very O
likely O
indulge O
so O
much O
as O
she O
used O
before O
she O
entered O
a O
decorous O
family O

At O

Becky S-PERSON
appear O
to O
take O
out O

sort O
of O
dresses O
or O
ornaments O
from O
the O

did O
arrive O

But O
out O

contained O
a O
mass O

furious O

, O
she O
took O
a O
picture O
with O
great O
glee O
, O
which O
she O
pinned O
up O
in O
her O
room O

and O
to O
which O
she O
introduced O
Jos S-PERSON

It O
was O
the O
portrait O
of O
a O
gentleman O
in O
pencil O

his O
face O
having O
the O
advantage O

painted O
up O

He O
was O
riding O
on O
an O
elephant O
away O
from O
some O

“ O
God O
bless O
my O
soul O

my O
portrait O

Jos S-PERSON
cried O
out O
. O
It O
was O
he O
indeed O
, O
blooming O
in O
youth O
and O
beauty O
, O
in O
a O
nankeen O
jacket O
of O

the O

to O
hang O
up O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square E-FAC

“ O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
” O
said O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
voice O
trembling O
with O
emotion O

“ O
I O
went O
to O

“ O
Won’t O
you O

” O
Jos S-PERSON
cried O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
unutterable O
rapture O
and O
satisfaction O
. O
“ O
Did O
you O
really O
now O

well O
enough O

had O
loved O
her O

He O
never O
could O
again O

That O
sort O
of O
regard O
, O
which O
he O
had O
proffered O
to O
her O
for O
so O
many O
faithful O
years O
can’t O
be O
flung O
down O
and O
shattered O

mended O
so O
as O
to O
show O
no O
scars O

The O
little O
heedless O
tyrant O
had O
so O
destroyed O
it O
. O
No O
, O
William S-PERSON
thought O
again O
and O
again O
, O
“ O
It O
was O
myself O
I O
deluded O

and O
persisted O
in O
cajoling O

had O
she O
been O
worthy O
of O
the O
love O
I O
gave O
her O
, O
she O
would O
have O
returned O
it O
long O
ago O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fond O
mistake O
. O
Isn’t O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
life O
made O
up O
of O
such O
? O

suppose O
I O
had O
won O
her O
, O
should O
I O
not O
have O
been O
disenchanted O
the O
day O
after O
my O
victory O

pine O
, O
or O
be O
ashamed O
of O
my O
defeat O

” O
The O
more O
he O
thought O
of O
this O
long O
passage O
of O
his O
life O
, O
the O
more O
clearly O
he O
saw O
his O
deception O
. O
“ O
I’ll O
go O
into O
harness O
again O
, O
” O
he O
said O

“ O

After O
June S-DATE
all O
the O
little O
Court B-ORG
Society I-ORG
of I-ORG
Pumpernickel E-ORG
used O
to O
separate O

according O
to O
the O
German S-NORP
plan O

make O
for O

where O
they O
drank O
at O
the O

rode O
upon O
donkeys O

gambled O
at O
the O

at O
the O

- O
d’hôte O

and O
idled O
away O
the O
summer O
. O
The O
English S-LANGUAGE
diplomatists O
went O
off O
to O
Toeplitz S-ORG
and O
Kissingen S-GPE
, O
their O
French S-NORP
rivals O
shut O
up O
their O
Chancellerie S-PRODUCT
and O
whisked O
away O
to O
their O
darling O
Boulevard B-FAC
de I-FAC
Gand E-FAC
. O
The O
Transparent O
reigning O

took O
too O
to O
the O
waters O
, O
or O
retired O
to O
their O
hunting O

Everybody O
went O
away O
having O
any O
pretension O
to O
politeness O

and O
of O
course O
, O
with O
them O
, O
Doctor O
von B-PERSON
Glauber E-PERSON
, O
the O
Court O
Doctor O
, O
and O
his O
Baroness S-PERSON
. O
The O
seasons O
for O
the O
baths O
were O
the O
most O
productive O
periods O
of O
the O
Doctor’s S-ORG
practice O
— O
he O
united O
business O
with O
pleasure O
, O
and O
his O
chief O
place O
of O
resort O
was O
Ostend S-GPE
, O
which O
is O
much O
frequented O
by O
Germans S-NORP
, O
and O
where O
the O
Doctor O
treated O
himself O
and O
his O
spouse O
to O
what O
he O
called O
a O
“ O
dib O
” O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
His O
interesting O
patient O
, O
Jos S-PERSON
, O
was O
a O
regular O
milch O
cow O
to O
the O
Doctor O
, O
and O
he O
easily O
persuaded O
the O
Civilian S-ORG
, O
both O
for O
his O
own O
health’s O
sake O
and O
that O
of O
his O
charming O
sister O
, O
which O
was O
really O
very O
much O
shattered O
, O
to O
pass O
the O
summer O
at O
that O
hideous O
seaport O
town O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
did O
not O
care O
where O
she O
went O
much O
. O
Georgy S-PERSON
jumped O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
move O
. O
As O
for O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
she O
came O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
in O
the O
fourth S-ORDINAL
place O
inside O
of O
the O
fine O
barouche O
Mr. O
Jos S-PERSON
had O
bought O
: O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
domestics O
being O
on O
the O
box O
in O
front O
. O
She O
might O
have O
some O
misgivings O
about O
the O
friends O
whom O
she O
should O
meet O
at O
Ostend S-GPE
, O
and O
who O
might O
be O
likely O
to O
tell O
ugly O
stories O
— O
but O
bah O
! O
she O
was O
strong O
enough O
to O
hold O
her O
own O
. O
She O
had O
cast O
such O
an O
anchor O
in O
Jos S-GPE
now O
, O
as O
would O
require O
a O
strong O
storm O
to O
shake O
. O
That O
incident O
of O
the O
picture O
had O
finished O
him O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
took O
down O
her O
elephant O
, O
and O
put O
it O
into O
the O
little O
box O
which O
she O
had O
had O
from O
Amelia S-PERSON
ever O
so O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
also O
came O
off O
with O
her O
Lares S-PERSON
, O
— O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
pictures O
, O
— O
and O
the O
party O
, O
finally O
, O
were O
lodged O
in O
an O
exceedingly O
dear O
and O
uncomfortable O
house O
at O
Ostend S-GPE
. O
There O
Amelia S-PERSON
began O
to O
take O
baths O
, O
and O
get O
what O
good O
she O
could O
from O
them O
, O
and O
though O
scores O
of O
people O
of O
Becky’s S-PERSON
acquaintance O
passed O
her O
and O
cut O
her O
, O
yet O
Mrs. O
Osborne S-PERSON
, O
who O
walked O
about O
with O
her O
, O
and O
who O
knew O
nobody O
, O
was O
not O
aware O
of O
the O
treatment O
experienced O
by O
the O
friend O
whom O
she O
had O
chosen O
so O
judiciously O
as O
a O
companion O
| | O
indeed O
, O
Becky S-PERSON
never O
thought O
fit O
to O
tell O
her O
what O
was O
passing O
under O
her O
innocent O
eyes O
. O
Some O
of O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley’s E-PERSON
acquaintances O
, O
however O
, O
acknowledged O
her O
readily O
enough O
, O
— O
perhaps O
more O
readily O
than O
she O
would O
have O
desired O
. O
Among O
those O
were O
Major O
Loder S-PERSON
( O
unattached O
) O
, O
and O
Captain O
Rook S-PERSON
( O
late B-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Rifles E-WORK_OF_ART
) O
, O
who O
might O
be O
seen O
any O
day O
on O
the O
Dyke S-PERSON
, O
smoking O
and O
staring O
at O
the O
women O
, O
and O
who O
speedily O
got O
an O
introduction O
to O
the O
hospitable O
board O
and O
select O
circle O
of O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
. O
In O
fact O
they O
would O
take O
no O
denial O
| | O
they O
burst O
into O
the O
house O
whether O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
at O
home O
or O
not O
, O
walked O
into O
Mrs. O
Osborne’s S-PERSON
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
which O
they O
perfumed O
with O
their O
coats O
and O
mustachios O
, O
called O
Jos S-PERSON
“ O
Old O
buck O
, O
” O
and O
invaded O
his O
dinner O
- O
table O
, O
and O
laughed O
and O
drank O
for O
long O
hours O
there O
. O
“ O
What O
can O
they O
mean O
? O
” O
asked O
Georgy S-PERSON
, O
who O
did O
not O
like O
these O
gentlemen O
. O
“ O
I O
heard O
the O
Major O
say O
to O
Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON
yesterday S-DATE
, O
‘ O
No O

no O

Becky S-PERSON
, O
you O
shan’t O

the O
old O

yourself O

must O

the O
bones O
in O

dammy O

I’ll S-PERSON
split O

’ O
What O
could O
the O
Major O
mean O
, O
mamma O
? O
” O
“ O
Major O
! O
don’t O
call O
him O
Major O
! O
” O
Emmy S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
I’m O
sure O
I O
can’t O
tell O
what O
he O
meant O
. O
” O
His O
presence O
and O
that O
of O
his O
friend O
inspired O
the O
little O
lady O
with O
intolerable O
terror O
and O
aversion O
. O
They O
paid O
her O
tipsy O
compliments O
| | O
they O
leered O
at O
her O
over O
the O
dinner O
- O
table O
. O
And O
the O
Captain O
made O
her O
advances O
that O
filled O
her O
with O
sickening O
dismay O
, O
nor O
would O
she O
ever O
see O
him O
unless O
she O
had O
George S-PERSON
by O
her O
side O
. O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
to O
do O
her O
justice O
, O
never O
would O
let O
either O
of O
these O
men O
remain O
alone O
with O
Amelia S-PERSON
| | O
the O
Major O
was O
disengaged O
, O
too O
, O
and O
swore O
he O
would O
be O
the O
winner O
of O
her O
. O
A O
couple O
of O
ruffians O
were O
fighting O
for O
this O
innocent O
creature O
, O
gambling O
for O
her O
at O
her O
own O
table O
| | O
and O
though O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
of O
the O
rascals’ O
designs O
upon O
her O
, O
yet O
she O
felt O
a O
horror O
and O
uneasiness O
in O
their O
presence O
, O
and O
longed O
to O
fly O
. O
She O
besought O
, O
she O
entreated O
Jos S-PERSON
to O
go O
. O
Not O
he O
. O
He O
was O
slow O
of O
movement O
, O
tied O
to O
his O
Doctor O
, O
and O
perhaps O
to O
some O
other O
leading O
- O
strings O
. O
At O
least O
Becky S-PERSON
was O
not O
anxious O
to O
go O
to O
England S-GPE
. O
At O
last O
she O
took O
a O
great O
resolution O
— O
made O
the O
great O
plunge O
. O
She O
wrote O
off O
a O
letter O
to O
a O
friend O
whom O
she O
had O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
water O
| | O
a O
letter O
about O
which O
she O
did O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
to O
anybody O
, O
which O
she O
carried O
herself O
to O
the O
post O
under O
her O
shawl O
, O
nor O
was O
any O
remark O
made O
about O
it O
: O
only O
that O
she O
looked O
very O
much O
flushed O
and O
agitated O
when O
Georgy S-PERSON
met O
her O
| | O
and O
she O
kissed O
him O
, O
and O
hung O
over O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
that O
night O
. O
She O
did O
not O
come O
out O
of O
her O
room O
after O
her O
return O
from O
her O
walk O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O
Major O
Loder S-PERSON
and O
the O
Captain O
who O
frightened O
her O
. O
“ O
She O
mustn’t O
stop O
here O
, O
” O
Becky S-PERSON
reasoned O
with O
herself O
. O
“ O
She O
must O
go O
away O
, O
the O
silly O
little O
fool O
. O
She O
is O
still O
whimpering O
after O
that O
gaby O
of O
a O
husband O
— O
dead O
( O
and O
served O
right O
! O
) O
these B-DATE
fifteen I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O
She O
shan’t O
marry O
either O
of O
these O
men O
. O
It’s O
too O
bad O
of O
Loder S-PERSON
. O
No O
| | O
she O
shall O
marry O
the O
bamboo O
- O
cane O
, O
I’ll O
settle O
it O
this O
very O
night O
. O
” O
So O
Becky S-PERSON
took O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
to O
Amelia S-PERSON
in O
her O
private O
apartment O
, O
and O
found O
that O
lady O
in O
the O
company O
of O
her O
miniatures O
, O
and O
in O
a O
most O
melancholy O
and O
nervous O
condition O
. O
She O
laid O
down O
the O
cup O
of O
tea O
. O
“ O
Thank O
you O
, O
” O

“ O

Becky S-PERSON

marching O
up O

down O
the O
room O

the O

her O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
contemptuous O
kindness O

he O
is O
too O

You O

one S-CARDINAL

deprecatingly O

she O
finished O
the O
sentence O

looking O
up O
at O
the O
portrait O

“ O
Couldn’t O

cried O
out O
Becky S-PERSON
, O
“ O
that O

starting O
up O

“ O
Look O
there O

you O

Becky S-PERSON
said O
, O
still O
with O
provoking O
good O
humour O
, O
and O
taking O
a O
little O
paper O
out O
of O
her O
belt O
, O
she O
opened O
it O
and O
flung O
it O
into O
Emmy’s O
lap O
. O
“ O
You O

” O
Becky S-PERSON
repeated O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
did O
not O
hear O
her O
| | O
she O
was O
looking O
at O
the O
letter O
. O
It O
was O
that O
which O
George S-PERSON
had O
put O
into O
the O
bouquet O
and O
given O
to O
Becky S-PERSON
on O
the O
night O
of O
the O
Duchess O
of O
Richmond’s O
ball O
. O
It O
was O
as O
she O
said O
: O
the O
foolish O
young O
man O
had O
asked O
her O
to O
fly O
. O
Emmy’s O
head O
sank O
down O
, O
and O
for O
almost O
the O
last O
time O
in O
which O
she O
shall O
be O
called O
upon O
to O
weep O
in O
this O
history O
, O
she O
commenced O
that O
work O
. O
Her O
head O
fell O
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
and O
her O
hands O
went O
up O
to O
her O
eyes O
| | O
and O
there O
for O
a O
while O
, O
she O
gave O
way O
to O
her O
emotions O
, O
as O
Becky S-PERSON
stood O
on O
and O
regarded O
her O
. O
Who O
shall O
analyse O
those O
tears O
, O
and O
say O
whether O
they O
were O
sweet O
or O
bitter O
? O
Was O
she O
most O
grieved O
, O
because O
the O
idol O
of O
her O
life O
was O
tumbled O
down O
and O
shivered O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
or O
indignant O
that O
her O
love O
had O
been O
so O
despised O
, O
or O
glad O
because O
the O
barrier O
was O
removed O
which O
modesty O
had O
placed O
between O
her O
and O
a O
new O
, O
a O
real O
affection O
? O
“ O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
forbid O
me O
now O
, O
” O
she O
thought O
. O
“ O
I O
may O
love O
him O
with O
all O
my O
heart O
now O
. O
O O
, O
I O
will O
, O
I O
will O
, O
if O
he O
will O
but O
let O
me O
and O
forgive O
me O
. O
” O
I O
believe O
it O
was O
this O
feeling O
rushed O
over O
all O
the O
others O
which O
agitated O
that O
gentle O
little O
bosom O
. O
Indeed O
, O
she O
did O
not O
cry O
so O
much O
as O
Becky S-PERSON
expected O
— O
the O
other O
soothed O
and O
kissed O
her O
— O
a O
rare O
mark O
of O
sympathy O
with O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
. O
She O
treated O
Emmy S-PERSON
like O
a O
child O
, O
and O
patted O
her O
head O
. O
“ O
And O
now O
let O
us O
get O
pen O
and O
ink O
, O
and O
write O
to O
him O
to O
come O
this O
minute O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
— O
I O
wrote O
to O
him O
this O
morning O
, O
” O
Emmy S-PERSON
said O
, O
blushing O
exceedingly O
. O
Becky S-PERSON
screamed O
with O
laughter O
— O
“ O
Un B-WORK_OF_ART
biglietto E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
” O
she O
sang O
out O
with O
Rosina S-PERSON
, O
“ O
eccolo O
quà O
! O
” O
— O
the O
whole O
house O
echoed O
with O
her O
shrill O
singing O
. O
Two B-TIME
mornings E-TIME
after O
this O
little O
scene O
, O
although O
the O
day O
was O
rainy O
and O
gusty O
, O
and O
Amelia S-PERSON
had O
had O
an O
exceedingly O
wakeful O
night O
, O
listening O
to O
the O
wind O
roaring O
, O
and O
pitying O
all O
travellers O
by O
land O
and O
by O
water O
, O
yet O
she O
got O
up O
early O
, O
and O
insisted O
upon O
taking O
a O
walk O
on O
the O
Dyke S-PERSON
with O
Georgy S-PERSON
| | O
and O
there O
she O
paced O
as O
the O
rain O
beat O
into O
her O
face O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
out O
westward O
across O
the O
dark O
sea O
line O
, O
and O
over O
the O
swollen O
billows O
which O
came O
tumbling O
and O
frothing O
to O
the O
shore O
. O
Neither O
spoke O
much O
, O
except O
now O
and O
then O
, O
when O
the O
boy O
said O
a O
few O
words O
to O
his O
timid O
companion O
, O
indicative O
of O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O
“ O
I O
hope O
he O
won’t O
cross O
in O
such O
weather O
, O
” O
Emmy S-PERSON
said O
. O
“ O
I O
bet O
ten O
to O
one O
he O
does O
, O
” O
the O
boy O
answered O
. O
“ O
Look O
, O
mother O
, O
there’s O
the O
smoke O
of O
the O
steamer O
. O
” O
It O
was O
that O
signal O
, O
sure O
enough O
. O
But O
though O
the O
steamer O
was O
under O
way O
, O
he O
might O
not O
be O
on O
board O
| | O
he O
might O
not O
have O
got O
the O
letter O
| | O
he O
might O
not O
choose O
to O
come O
. O
— O
A O
hundred S-CARDINAL
fears O
poured O
one O
over O
the O
other O
into O
the O
little O
heart O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
waves O
on O
to O
the O
Dyke S-PERSON
. O
The O
boat O
followed O
the O
smoke O
into O
sight O
. O
Georgy S-PERSON
had O
a O
dandy O
telescope O
, O
and O
got O
the O
vessel O
under O
view O
in O
the O
most O
skilful O
manner O
. O
And O
he O
made O
appropriate O
nautical O
comments O
upon O
the O
manner O
of O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
steamer O
as O
she O
came O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
, O
dipping O
and O
rising O
in O
the O
water O
. O
The O
signal O
of O
an O
English S-LANGUAGE
steamer O
in O
sight O
went O
fluttering O
up O
to O
the O
mast O
on O
the O
pier O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
Mrs. O
Amelia’s S-PERSON
heart O
was O
in O
a O
similar O
flutter O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
tried O
to O
look O
through O
the O
telescope O
over O
George’s S-PERSON
shoulder O
, O
but O
she O
could O
make O
nothing O
of O
it O
. O
She O
only O
saw O
a O
black O
eclipse O
bobbing O
up O
and O
down O
before O
her O
eyes O
. O
George S-PERSON
took O
the O
glass O
again O
and O
raked O
the O
vessel O
. O
“ O
How O
she O
does O
pitch O
! O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
There O
goes O
a O
wave O
slap O
over O
her O
bows O
. O
There’s O
only O
two S-CARDINAL
people O
on O
deck O
besides O
the O
steersman O
. O
There’s O
a O
man O
lying O
down O
, O
and O
a O
— O
chap O
in O
a O
— O
cloak O
with O
a O
— O
Hooray O
! O
— O
It’s O
Dob O
, O
by O
Jingo S-PERSON
! O
” O
He O
clapped O
to O
the O
telescope O
, O
and O
flung O
his O
arms O
round O
his O
mother O
. O
As O
for O
that O
lady O
: O
let O
us O
say O
what O
she O
did O
in O
the O
words O
of O
a O
favourite O
poet O
— O
[ O
Greek S-NORP
] O
. O
She O
was O
sure O
it O
was O
William S-PERSON
. O
It O
could O
be O
no O
other O
. O
What O
she O
had O
said O
about O
hoping O
that O
he O
would O
not O
come O
was O
all O
hypocrisy O
. O
Of O
course O
he O
would O
come O
: O
what O
could O
he O
do O
else O
but O
come O
? O
She O
knew O
he O
would O
come O
. O
The O
ship O
came O
swiftly O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
. O
As O
they O
went O
in O
to O
meet O
her O
at O
the O
landing O
- O
place O
at O
the O
Quay S-FAC
, O
Emmy’s S-PERSON
knees O
trembled O
so O
that O
she O
scarcely O
could O
run O
. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
kneel O
down O
and O
say O
her O
prayers O
of O
thanks O
there O
. O
Oh O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
she O
would O
be O
all O
her O
life O
saying O
them O
! O
It O
was O
such O
a O
bad O
day O
that O
as O
the O
vessel O
came O
alongside O
of O
the O
Quay S-FAC
there O
were O
no O
idlers O
abroad O
| | O
scarcely O
even O
a O
commissioner O
on O
the O
look O
- O
out O
for O
the O
few O
passengers O
in O
the O
steamer O
. O
That O
young O
scapegrace O
George S-PERSON
had O
fled O
, O
too O
: O
and O
as O
the O
gentleman O
in O
the O
old O
cloak O
lined O
with O
red O
stuff O
stepped O
on O
to O
the O
shore O
, O
there O
was O
scarcely O
any O
one O
present O
to O
see O
what O
took O
place O
, O
which O
was O
briefly O
this O
: O
A O
lady O
in O
a O
dripping O
white O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
, O
with O
her O
two S-CARDINAL
little O
hands O
out O
before O
her O
, O
went O
up O
to O
him O
, O
and O
in O
the O
next O
minute O
she O
had O
altogether O
disappeared O
under O
the O
folds O
of O
the O
old O
cloak O
, O
and O
was O
kissing O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
his O
hands O
with O
all O
her O
might O
| | O
whilst O
the O
other O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
was O
engaged O
in O
holding O
her O
to O
his O
heart O
( O
which O
her O
head O
just O
about O
reached O
) O
and O
in O
preventing O
her O
from O
tumbling O
down O
. O
She O
was O
murmuring O
something O
about O
— O
forgive O
— O
dear O
William S-PERSON
— O
dear O
, O
dear O
, O
dearest O
friend O
— O
kiss O
, O
kiss O
, O
kiss O
, O
and O
so O
forth O
— O
and O
in O
fact O
went O
on O
under O
the O
cloak O
in O
an O
absurd O
manner O
. O
When O
Emmy S-WORK_OF_ART
emerged O
from O
it O
, O
she O
still O
kept O
tight O
hold O
of O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
William’s S-PERSON
hands O
, O
and O
looked O
up O
in O
his O
face O
. O
It O

sadness O

tender O
love O

She O
understood O
its O
reproach O
, O
and O
hung O
down O
her O
head O
. O
“ O
It O

“ O
No O

he O
answered O
: O
and O
pressed O
the O
dear O
little O
soul O
once O
more O
to O
his O
heart O

As O
they O
issued O
out O

the O
Custom O

, O
Georgy S-PERSON
broke O
out O
on O
them O
, O
with O
his O

up O
to O
his O
eye O
, O
and O
a O
loud O
laugh O
of O
welcome O

he O
danced O
round O
the O
couple O
, O

performed O
many O
facetious O
antics O

he O
led O
them O
up O

. O
Georgy S-PERSON
ran O
off O
to O
see O
about O
breakfast O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
, O
whose O
shawl O

were O
off O
in O
the O
passage O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Mrs. O
Payne S-PERSON
, O
now O
went O
to O
undo O
the O

and O
— O
we O
will O

, O
go O
with O
George S-PERSON

look O
after O
breakfast O
for O
the O
Colonel O
. O
The O
vessel O
is O
in O
port O

He O
has O
got O
the O
prize O
he O
has O
been O
trying O
for O
all O
his O
life O
. O
The O
bird O
has O
come O
in O
at O
last O
. O
There O
it O
is O
with O
its O
head O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
billing O
and O
cooing O
close O
up O
to O
his O
heart O
, O
with O
soft O
, O
outstretched O
, O
fluttering O
wings O

This O
is O
what O
he O
has O
asked O
for O
every O
day O

hour O
for O
eighteen B-DATE
years E-DATE

This O
is O
what O
he O
pined O

Farewell S-PERSON

dear O
Amelia S-PERSON
— O
Grow O
green O
again O
, O
tender O
little O
parasite O
, O
round O
the O
rugged O
old O
oak O
to O
which O
you O
cling O
! O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
compunction O
towards O
the O
kind O
and O
simple O
creature O
, O
who O
had O
been O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
in O
life O
to O
defend O
her O
, O
perhaps O
it O
was O
a O
dislike O
to O
all O
such O
sentimental O
scenes O
, O
— O
but O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
satisfied O
with O
her O
part O
in O
the O
transaction O
, O
never O
presented O
herself O
before O
Colonel O
Dobbin S-PERSON
and O
the O
lady O
whom O
he O
married O
. O
“ O
Particular O
business O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
took O
her O
to O
Bruges S-GPE
, O
whither O
she O
went O
| | O
and O
only O
Georgy S-PERSON
and O
his O
uncle O
were O
present O
at O
the O
marriage O
ceremony O
. O
When O
it O
was O
over O
, O
and O
Georgy S-PERSON
had O
rejoined O
his O
parents O
, O
Mrs. O
Becky S-PERSON
returned O
( O
just O
for O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
) O
to O
comfort O
the O
solitary O
bachelor O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
. O
He O
preferred O
a O
continental O
life O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
declined O
to O
join O
in O
housekeeping O
with O
his O
sister O
and O
her O
husband O
. O
Emmy S-PERSON
was O
very O
glad O
in O
her O
heart O
to O
think O
that O
she O
had O
written O
to O
her O
husband O
before O
she O
read O
or O
knew O
of O
that O
letter O
of O
George’s S-PERSON
. O
“ O
I O
knew O
it O
all O
along O
, O
” O
William S-PERSON
said O
| | O
“ O
but O
could O
I O
use O
that O
weapon O
against O
the O
poor O
fellow’s O
memory O
? O
It O
was O
that O
which O
made O
me O
suffer O
so O
when O
you O
— O
— O
” O
“ O
Never O
speak O
of O
that O
day O
again O
, O
” O
Emmy O
cried O
out O
, O
so O
contrite O
and O
humble O
, O
that O
William S-PERSON
turned O
off O
the O
conversation O
, O
by O
his O
account O
of O
Glorvina S-PERSON
and O
dear O
old O
Peggy B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
, O
with O
whom O
he O
was O
sitting O
when O
the O
letter O
of O
recall O
reached O
him O
. O
“ O
If O
you O
hadn’t O
sent O
for O
me O
, O
” O
he O
added O
with O
a O
laugh O
, O
“ O
who O
knows O
what O
Glorvina’s S-PERSON
name O
might O
be O
now O
? O
” O
At O
present O
it O
is O
Glorvina B-PERSON
Posky E-PERSON
( O
now O
Mrs. O
Major B-PERSON
Posky E-PERSON
) O
| | O
she O
took O
him O
on O
the O
death O
of O
his O
first S-ORDINAL
wife O
, O
having O
resolved O
never O
to O
marry O
out O
of O
the O
regiment O
. O
Lady O
O’Dowd S-PERSON
is O
also O
so O
attached O
to O
it O
that O
, O
she O
says O
, O
if O
anything O
were O
to O
happen O
to O
Mick S-PERSON
, O
bedad O
she’d O
come O
back O
and O
marry O
some O
of O
’em O
. O
But O
the O
Major O
- O
General O

quite O
well O
, O

lives O
in O
great O
splendour O

with O
a O

exception O
of O
perhaps O
their O
neighbour O
, O
Hoggarty B-PERSON

he O
is O
the O

man O
of O
his O

Her O

the I-WORK_OF_ART

Both O
she O
and O
Glorvina S-PERSON
declared O
that O
Dobbin S-PERSON
had O
used O
the O
latter O
sheamfully O
, O
but O
Posky S-PERSON
falling O
in O
, O
Glorvina S-PERSON
was O
consoled O
, O
and O
a O
beautiful O
turban O
from O
Paris S-GPE
appeased O
the O
wrath O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
O’Dowd E-PERSON
. O
When O
Colonel O
Dobbin S-PERSON
quitted O
the O

he O
did O
immediately O
after O

All O
idea O
of O

out O

the O
Baronet’s S-PERSON

Lady O

Mrs. O

with O

A O
match O
between O
George S-PERSON

that O
young O
lady O
was O
long O
a O
favourite O
scheme O
of O
both O
the O
matrons O
, O
though O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
Miss O

herself O
inclined O
towards O
her O
cousin O

Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley’s E-PERSON
name O
was O
never O
mentioned O
by O
either O
family O

There O
were O
reasons O
why O
all O
should O
be O
silent O
regarding O
her O

For O
wherever O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley E-PERSON
went O
, O
she O
travelled O
likewise O

and O
that O
infatuated O
man O
seemed O
to O
be O
entirely O
her O
slave O

The O
Colonel’s S-NORP
lawyers O
informed O
him O
that O
his O
brother O

in O

law O
had O
effected O
a O
heavy O
insurance O
upon O
his O
life O

whence O
it O
was O
probable O
that O
he O
had O
been O
raising O
money O
to O
discharge O
debts O

He O
procured O
prolonged O
leave O

absence O
from O
the B-FAC
East I-FAC
India I-FAC
House E-FAC

indeed O
his O
infirmities O
were O
daily S-DATE
increasing O

On O
hearing O
the O
news O
about O
the O
insurance O
, O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
good O
deal O

alarm O

entreated O
her O

go O
to O
Brussels S-GPE

Jos S-PERSON

was O
, O

The O
Colonel O

reluctance O

was O

recovering O
from O
the O
chicken O

and O
went O
to O
Brussels S-GPE

found O
Jos S-PERSON
living O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
enormous O
hotels O
in O
that O
city O

Mrs. O
Crawley S-PERSON

who O
had O
her O
carriage O

gave O
entertainments O

lived O
in O
a O
very O
genteel O
manner O

occupied O
another O
suite O
of O
apartments O
in O
the O

The O
Colonel O

of O

, O
did O
not O
desire O
to O
see O
that O

even O
think O
proper O
to O
notify O
his O
arrival O
at O
Brussels S-GPE

except O
privately O
, O
to O
Jos S-PERSON
by O
a O
message O
through O
his O
valet O
. O
Jos S-PERSON
begged O
the O
Colonel O
to O
come O
and O
see O
him O
that O
night O
, O
when O
Mrs. O

would O
be O
at O
a O
soirée O
, O

when O
they O
could O
meet O
alone O

He O
found O
his O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
in O
a O
condition O
of O
pitiable O
infirmity O

and O
dreadfully O
afraid O
of O
Rebecca S-PERSON
, O
though O
eager O
in O
his O
praises O
of O
her O

She O
tended O
him O
through O
a O
series O
of O
unheard O
- O
of O
illnesses O

with O
a O
fidelity O
most O
admirable O

She O
had O
been O
a O
daughter O

him O

“ O

whimpered O
out O
the O
unfortunate O
man O

The O
Colonel’s S-NORP
brow O
darkened O
at O
this O
. O
“ O
We O
can’t O

Jos S-PERSON

he O
said O
