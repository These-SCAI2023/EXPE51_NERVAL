the O

Joseph B-PERSON

heaved O
something O
very O
like O
a O
sigh O
out O
of O

he O

cast O

said O

felt O
at O

an O

the O

she O
looked O
at O
him O

if O
I O

say O

that O
they O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
each O

at O
that O

time O
, O
I O
should O
|
| O
perhaps O
be O
telling O
an O
untruth O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
these O
two B-CARDINAL

had O
been O
bred O
up O

Amelia B-PERSON
took O
the O
news O
very O
palely O

and O
calmly O
. O
It O
was O
only O
the O
confirmation O
of O
the O
dark O
presages O
which O
had O
|
| O
long O
gone O
before O
. O
It O
was O
the O
mere O
reading O
of O
the O
sentence O
— O
of O
the O
crime O
|
| O
she O
had O
long O

been O
guilty O
— O
the O
crime O
of O
loving O
wrongly O
, O
too O
violently O
, O
|

against O
reason O
. O
She O
told O
no O
more O
of O
her O
thoughts O
now O
than O
she O
had O

before O

She O
seemed O
scarcely O
more O
unhappy O
now O
when O
convinced O
all O

over O

felt O

dared O
not O

that O
it O

was O
gone O

So O
she O
changed O
from O
the O
large O
house O

the O
small O
one O
without O

No O

She O
put O

three B-CARDINAL
trinkets O
  O

, O
as O

That O
effort O
was O
too O

much O
for O
her O
  O
she O
placed O
them O
back O
in O

again O

How O

’s O
usual O
terrors O

increased O
greatly O

when O
such O
dismal O
propositions O
were O
made O
to O
her O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
saw O
that O

she O
must O
get O
her O
patient O

health O
before O

Whither B-PERSON

that O

her O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
|
| O
justly O
felt O
. O
‘ O
We O

go O

visit O
our O
beautiful O
suburbs O

London B-GPE

” O
|

she O
then O

‘ O

the O
most O
picturesque O

  O
” O

so O
she O
had O
a O
sudden O
interest O
for O
Hampstead B-GPE

found O

that O

getting O

he O
said O
this O
, O
poor O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON
blushed O
crimson O

and O
felt O

owned O
that O

for O
him O
, O
perhaps O
, O
this O

need O
never O

taken O

Why O

? O
What O
call O
was O
there O
to O
press O
it O

have O
parted O

rate O

Amelia B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O
might O
have O
recovered O
the O
shock O
of O
losing O
him O

It O
was O
his O

about O

all O
that O
was O
to O
ensue O
from O
|
| O
it O
. O
And O
why O
was O
it O
? O
Because O
he O
loved O
her O
so O
much O
that O
he O
could O
not O
|
| O
bear O
to O
see O
her O
unhappy O
: O
or O
because O
his O
own O
sufferings O
of O
suspense O
were O

so O
unendurable O
that O
he O
was O
glad O

Thus O
somehow O
the O

almost O
as O

been O
ruined O

schemes O

|

| O
It O
was O
all O
very O
true O
. O
Briggs B-PERSON
saw O
the O
stratagems O
as O
clearly O
as O
possible O
. O
|
| O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
had O
made O
the O
match O
between O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
Yet O
, O
|
| O
though O
the O
latter O
was O
a O
perfectly O
innocent O
victim O
, O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
could O
not O
|
| O
disguise O
from O
her O
friend O
her O
fear O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
affections O
were O
|
| O
hopelessly O
estranged O
from O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
would O
never O
|
| O
forgive O
her O
nephew O
for O
making O
so O
imprudent O
a O
marriage O
. O
|

| O
On O
this O
point O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
her O
own O
opinion O
, O
and O
still O
kept O
up O
a O
good O
|
| O
heart O
. O
If O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
did O
not O
forgive O
them O
at O
present O
, O
she O
might O
at O
least O
|

relent O
on O
a B-DATE

should O
anything O

plentifully O

out O

off O
  O
she O
came O
back O
to O
the O
breakfast O

table O
, O
and O

| O
ate O
some O
prawns O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
appetite O
, O
considering O

emotion O
  O

and O
while O
she O
was O
munching O
these O

, O
explained O
to O
Rawdon B-PERSON
what O

had O
occurred O
in O
her O
morning O
walk O
between O
herself O

Briggs B-PERSON

Her O
hopes O

were O
very O
high O
: O
she O
made O
her O
husband O

She O
generally O
suc- O

ceeded O
in O

her O
opinions O
, O
whether O
melancholy O

cheerful O
. O

“ O
You O
will O
now O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
writing O

table O

and O
pen O
me O
a O
pretty O
little O
letter O

in O

you O

” O
So O
Rawdon B-PERSON
sate O
down O
, O
and O

wrote O
off O
, O
“ O

and O
“ O
My O

with O
great O

rapidity O
: O
but O
there O
the O
gallant O
officer O

imagination O
failed O
him O
. O
He O

| O
mumbled O
the O
end O
of O
his O
pen O

and O
looked O
up O
in O

wife O

. O
She O
conld O

| O
not O
help O
laughing O
at O
his O
rueful O
countenance O
, O
and O
, O
marching O
up O

down O

room O
with O
her O
hands O
behind O
her O
, O
the O
: O
little O
woman O
began O
to O
dictate O
a O

he O
took O
down O
. O

“ O

“ O

” O
said O
Rawdon B-PERSON

rather O
surprised O

took O
the O
humour O
of O
the O

phrase O

presently O
wrote O
it O
down O

the O

interposed O

“ O

Rebecca B-PERSON
insisted O
with O
a O
stamp O
of O
her O
foot O
, O
‘ O
‘ O
to O

I O
beseech O
you O
before O

not O

perhaps O
to O
return O
, O
once O
more O
to O

me O
press O

| O
“ O
Kindnesses B-PRODUCT

” O
echoed O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
scratching O
down O
the O
words O
, O
|
| O
and O
quite O
amazed O
at O
his O
own O
facility O
of O
composition O
. O
|

| O
sf O
I O
ask O
nothing O
from O
you O
but O
that O
we O
should O
part O
not O
in O
anger O
. O
I O
have O
|
| O
the O
pride O
of O
my O
family O
on O
some O
points O
, O
though O
not O
on O
all O

I O
married O
a O

not O
ashamed O

” O

“ O
No O

Rawdon B-PERSON
ejaculated O
. O

| O
“ O
You O

” O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
, O
pinching O
his O
ear O
and O
looking O
over O
to O

see O
that O
he O
made O
no O

So O
he O
altered O
these O

bowing O
to O
the O

of O

pined O

fancy O

consigning O

passed O

It O
is O
very O

the O
loss O

good O

The O
poor O

let O
her O

go O
without O
saying O

a O
word O

her O
head O
fell O
on O
her O
breast O

called O
away O

away O

with O
the O
bouquet O

when O

gave O
it O
to O

there O
lay O
a O
note O

coiled O

snake O
among O

Rebecca B-PERSON

eye O
caught O
it O
at O
once O

used O

deal O
with O
notes O
in O
early O

She O
put O
out O
her O
hand O

took O
the O
nosegay O

He O
saw O
by O
her O

they O
met O

that O
she O
was O
aware O

what O
she O
should O
find O
there O

Her O
husband O
hurried O
her O
away O
, O
still O
too O

intent O
upon O
his O
own O
thoughts O
, O
seemingly O
, O
to O
take O
note O
of O
any O
marks O
of O

recognition O
which O
might O
pass O
between O
his O
friend O

his O
wife O

These O

were O
, O
however O
, O

trifling O

Rebecca B-PERSON
gave O
George B-PERSON
her O
hand O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

her O
usual O
quick O
knowing O
glances O

made O
a O
curtsey O

walked O
away O

George B-PERSON
bowed O
over O
the O

nothing O

was O
thus O

away O
, O

his O
selfishness O

punished O
just O
as O
such O
odious O

The O

George B-PERSON

out O

presently O

Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
the O
opportunity O
which O
his O
heart O
coveted O

he O
got O
sight O
of O

Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
face O
once O
more O
. O
But O
what O
a O
face O
it O
was O
! O
So O
white O
, O
so O
wild O
|
| O
and O
despair O
- O
stricken O
, O
that O
the O
remembrance O
of O
it O
haunted O
him O
afterwards O
|
| O
like O
a O
crime O
, O
and O
the O
sight O
smote O
him O
with O
inexpressible O
pangs O
of O
longing O

and O
pity O

| O
She O

hair O
falling O
on O
her O

eyes O
fixed O

that O

could O
be O

useful O
at O
a O
moment O
so O
critical O
, O
this O
poor O
soul O

taken O
up O
a O
sash O
of O

George B-PERSON

from O
the O

it O
lay O

him O
to O

fro B-ORG

with O
the O
sash O
in O
her O
hand O
, O
looking O
on O
mutely O
as O
his O
packing O
proceeded O
. O
|
| O
She O
came O
out O
and O
stood O
, O
leaning O
at O
the O
wall O
, O
holding O
this O
sash O
against O
her O
|
| O
bosom O
, O
from O
which O
the O
heavy O
net O
of O
crimson O
dropped O
like O
a O
large O
stain O
of O

blood O
. O
Our O
gentle O
- O
hearted O
Captain O
felt O
a O
guilty O
shock O
as O
he O
looked O
at O

her O
. O
“ O
Good O
God O
, O
” O
thought O
he O
, O
“ O

is O
it O
grief O

dared O
to O
pry O

And O
there O

no O

no O

to O
soothe O
and O
comfort O
this O

helpless O
, O
speechless O
misery O
. O
He O
stood O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
, O
|
| O
powerless O
and O
torn O
with O
pity O
, O
as O
a O
parent O
regards O
an O
infant O
in O
pain O

At O
last O
, O
George B-PERSON

Osborne B-PERSON

not O
scruple O

show O
his O
contempt O
for O

the O

But O
Emmy B-PERSON

always O
been O

him O

who O

her O
sweet O

her O

timid O

But O
the O

in O
his O

‘ O

Isidor B-PERSON

In O

Rebecca B-PERSON

him O

whither O
he O
followed O

her O
quite O
breathless O
to O
conclude O
the O

Jos B-PERSON
seldom O
spent O
a B-TIME

‘ O

she O

Rawdon B-PERSON

ordered O
her O
not O

a O

than O
that O
which O
she O

Lord B-PERSON

Bareacres I-PERSON
below O

regard O
for O
the O
Sedley B-PERSON
family O

her O
dear O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
must O
conceive O

nobody O
, O
in O
a O

more O

more O
firm O
about O

| O
Jos B-PERSON
ended O
by O
agreeing O
, O
as O
might O
be O
supposed O
of O
him O
. O
The O
sum O
he O
had O

to O
give O
her O
was O
so O
large O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
ask O
for O
time O
  O
so O
large O
as O

to O
be O
a O
little O
fortune O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
who O
rapidly O
calculated O
that O
with O
this O

the O
sale O
of O

and O
her O
pension O
as O
a O

she O
would O
now O
be O
absolutely O
independent O
of O
the O

world O
, O
and O
might O
look O
her O

|

| O
Once O
or O
twice O
in O
the B-DATE

she O
certainly O
had O
herself O
thought O
about O
flying O

But O
her O
reason O
gave O
her O
better O
counsel O
. O
“ O
Suppose O
the O
French B-NORP

” O

thought O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
‘ O
what O
can O
they O
do O
to O

Meanwhile O
Jos B-PERSON

off O

He O

would O
ride O

And O
he O
left O

busy O
in O
getting O
the O

went O
homewards O
himself O
to O
prepare O

for O
his O

It O
must O

He O
would O
go O

He O

By O

‘ O

“ O

then O

anything O

what O

it O
was O
that O

both O

down O

promise O

“ O
Do O

let O

again O

” O
said O
the O
old O
lady O

“ O
She O

is O
stupid O

I O
never O

” O
Pitt B-PERSON
promised O
that O
he O
would O
do O
so O
. O
He O
did O
not O
tell O
the O
|
| O
Countess O
of O

what O

who O
, O
on O

so O
, O
nothing O
loth O
to O
comfort O
a O
sick O
lady O
, O
and O
perhaps O
not O
sorry O
in O
|
| O
her O
heart O
to O
be O
freed O
now O
and O
again O
from O
the O
dreary O

of O
the O

his O

hatred O
rushed O

out O

against O

He O
was O

the O

not O

her O
in O

out O

made O
some O

he O
suddenly O
recollected O

up O

out O
his O

Osborne B-PERSON
made O
no O

shouted O
out O
once O

more O

with O
another O
curse O
to O
his O

Now O

our O

that O

never O
ventured O

was O
not O

might O
kill O
it O

upon O
his O

such O
a O
sarcastic O

when O

often O
ask O
the O
cause O

It O

spoke O

Little O

very O

could O
under- O

stand O
no O

into O

into O
his O

The O
very O
joy O
of O
this O

was O

a O
sort O
of O
grief O
, O
or O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
its O
expression O
was O
tears O
. O
Her O
|
| O
sensibilities O
were O
so O
weak O

tremulous O
, O
that O
perhaps O
they O
ought O
not O
to O

be O
talked O
about O
in O
a O
book O

I O
was O
told O
by O
Dr. O
Pestler B-PERSON
, O
( O
now O
a O
most O

lady O

) O
that O
her O
|
| O
grief O
at O
weaning O
the O
child O
was O
a O
sight O
that O
would O
have O
unmanned O
a O
Herod B-ORG

He O
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE

, O
and O
his O
wife O
was O

jealous O

of O
Mrs B-PERSON
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
then O
and O
long O
afterwards O
. O
|

| O
Perhaps O
the O
Doctor O
’s O
lady O
had O
good O
reason O
for O
her O
jealousy O
: O
most O
|
| O
women O
shared O
it O
, O
of O
those O
who O
formed O
the O
small O
circle O
of O
Amelia B-ORG
’s O
|
| O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
were O
quite O
angry O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
the O
|
| O
other O
sex O
regarded O
her O
. O
For O
almost O
all O
men O
who O
came O
near O
her O
loved O
|
| O
her O
  O
though O
no O
doubt O
they O
would O
be O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
She O
was O
|
| O
not O
brilliant O
, O
nor O
witty O
, O
nor O
wise O
overmuch O
, O
nor O
extraordinarily O
handsome O
. O
|
| O
But O
wherever O
she O
went O
she O
touched O
and O
charmed O
every O
one O
of O
the O
male O
|
| O
sex O
, O
as O
invariably O
as O
she O
awakened O
the O
scorn O
and O
incredulity O
of O
her O
own O
|
| O
sisterhood O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
her O
weakness O
which O
was O
her O
principal O
charm O
: O
— O
|
| O
a O
kind O
of O
sweet O
submission O
and O
softness O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
appeal O
to O
each O
|
| O
man O
she O
met O
for O
his O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
in O
the O
|
| O
regiment O
, O
though O
she O
spoke O
but O
to O
few O
of O
George B-PERSON
’s O
comrades O
there O
, O
all O
the O
|
| O
swords O
of O
the O
young O
fellows O
at O
the O
mess O

table O
would O
have O
leapt O
from O
their O

scabbards O
to O
fight O
round O
her O
: O
and O
so O
it O
was O
in O
the O
little O
narrow O
lodging- O

house O
and O

Sir O

that O
she O
would O
not O
quit O
the O
premises O
. O
|
| O
She O
contented O
herself O
by O
preserving O
a O
solemn O
and O
stony O
silence O
, O
when O
in O
|

company O
of O
Pitt B-ORG
and O
his O
rebellious O
wife O
, O
and O
by O
frightening O

in O

the O

the O
ghastly O

bending O

welcomed O
Rawdon B-PERSON

as O

those O
prodigals O
returned O
to O
their O
family O
. O
|

| O
To O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
they O
were O
not O
affected O
very O
much O
one O
way O
or O
other O
by O
|
| O
this O
coolness O
. O
Her O
Ladyship O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
was O
a O
person O
only O
of O
secondary O

consideration O
in O
their O
minds O
just O
then O
— O
they O
were O
intent O
upon O
the O
reception O
|

which O
the O
reigning O
brother O

sister O
would O
afford O
them O
. O
|

| O
Pitt B-PERSON
with O
rather O
a O
heightened O
colour O
went O
up O
and O
shook O
his O
brother O
by O
|
| O
the O
hand O
  O
and O
saluted O
Rebecca B-PERSON
with O
a O
hand O
- O
shake O
and O
a O
very O
low O
bow O
. O
|
| O
But O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane I-PERSON
took O
both O
the O
hands O
of O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
kissed O
her O
|
| O
affectionately O
. O
The O
embrace O
somehow O
brought O
tears O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
|
| O
little O
adventuress O
— O
which O
ornaments O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
she O
wore O
very O
seldom O
. O
|
| O
The O
artless O
mark O
of O
kindness O
and O
confidence O
touched O
and O
pleased O
her O
  O
and O
|

Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
encouraged O
by O
this O
demonstration O
. O
on O
his O
sister O

part O
, O
twirled O
up O

his O
mustachios O
, O
and O
took O
leave O
to O
salute O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane I-PERSON
with O
a O
kiss O
, O
which O
|

caused O
her O

to O
blush O
exceedingly O

“ O
Dev’lish O

was O
his O
verdict O
, O
when O
he O

were O
together O
again O

recalled O

kindly O

about O

In O
fact O
you O
would O
have O
supposed O
that O
ever O

have O
struck O

To O

injurious O

Amelia B-PERSON
was O
not O
like O
the O
portrait O
the O
Major O

formed O
of O
her O
: O

there O
was O
a O
figure O
in O

book O
of O

which O
his O

had O
in O
England B-GPE
, O

and O
with O
which O
William B-PERSON
had O
made O
away O
privately O
, O
pasting O
it O
into O
the O
lid O

of O
his O
desk O
, O
and O
fancying O
he O
saw O
some O
resemblance O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
in O
|
| O
the O
print O
, O
whereas O
I O
have O
seen O
it O
, O
and O
can O
vouch O
that O
it O
is O
but O
the O
picture O

of O
a O
high O

waisted O
gown O
with O
an O
impossible O
doll O

face O
simpering O
over O
it O

and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
Mr. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
sentimental O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
no O
more O
like O
the O
real O
|
| O
one B-CARDINAL
than O
this O
absurd O
little O

he O

what O
man O
in O

love O
, O
of O
us O
, O
is O
better O
informed O
? O
— O
or O
is O
he O
much O
happier O
when O
he O
sees O
and O
|
| O
owns O
his O
delusion O
? O
Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
under O
this O
spell O
. O
He O
did O
not O
bother O
his O
|

friends O
and O
the O
public O
much O
about O
his O
feelings O
, O
or O
indeed O
lose O
his O
natural O
|
| O
zest O
or O
appetite O
on O
account O
of O
them O
. O
His O
head O
has O
grizzled O
since O
we O

him O
last O

are O
not O

down O

was O
not O
nearly O

the O
quality O
of O
the O
ancient O

formed O
the O

material O
of O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON

say O
that O

could O
not O
afford O
such O

checked O
that O
speech O

with O
an O
effort O
, O

as O
one O
uncharitable O

would O
have O
failed O
her O

fact O

when O

putting O
Sir O

Mrs. O

quietly O

Briggs B-PERSON
saw O
her O
take O
them O

asked O

told O
no O

  O
but O
I O

believe O
quite O
sympathised O
with O
her O
on O
this O

so O

her O

entirely O

him O

Her O
own O
pittance O
was O
so O
small O

that O
it O
would O
barely O
enable O
her O

them O

would O
do O
all O
in O

make O
him O

She O
described O
his O

such O
as O
she O

however O
still O
remained O
behind O

whence O
my O

came O
to O
the O
painful O
conclusion O
that O
Mrs. O

| O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
made O
some O
other O
use O
of O

that O

for O
which O
her O

patron O
had O
given O
the O
loan O
. O
However O
, O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
|
| O
was O
not O
so O
rude O
as O
to O
impart O
his O
suspicions O
upon O
this O
head O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky B-PERSON
, O

whose O
feelings O
might O
be O
hurt O
by O
any O
controversy O
on O
the O
money O

question O
, O

and O
who O
might O
have O
a O
thousand O
painful O
reasons O
for O
disposing O
otherwise O
of O

| O
his O
lordship O

generous O
loan O

But O
he O
determined O
to O
satisfy O
himself O
of O
the O

real O
state O
of O
the O

for O
this O
I O
might O

quite O
a O

I O
did O

do O
my O
duty O

with O

bad O

the O

were O
wrenched O

a O

“ O

Sir O

guessed O
the O
truth O

the O

wished O

Colonel O
told O
his O

briefly O

in O
broken O

, O
the O
circumstances O

“ O

“ O

I O

when O
I O

she O

sitting O

” O
He O
then O
went O
on O
to O
describe O
hurriedly O
the O

sonal O
conflict O

‘ O
“ O
Andas O
it O

end O

for O
me O

” O
Rawdon B-PERSON
said O
with O

a O
broken O
voice O
, O
“ O

as O

” O

The O
elder O

was O
much O
affected O
, O
and O
shook O
Rawdon B-PERSON

hand O
with O
a O

cordiality O
seldom O
exhibited O
by O
him O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
passed O
his O

over O
his O

shaggy O
eyebrows O
. O
‘ O

‘ O

the O

thus O
, O

almost O

mutely O
, O
this O
bargain O
was O
struck O
between O
them O

Then O
Rawdon B-PERSON
took O
out O

it O

Then O
the O
sleepless O

went O
shirking O
round O

Jos B-PERSON

know O
what O

we O

not O

by O

he O

that O
he O

not O

that O

it O
was O
most O

ungentlemanlike O
to O
disturb O

out O

in O

The O

some O

The O
truth O

that O

had O
impressed O

duty O
most O
strongly O

in O
fine O
I O
am O

tell O

The O
fact O
was O
, O
as O

bought O

it O
himself O
, O

anything O

as O
a O

him O

‘ O
Do O
you O

  O

the O
question O
, O
the O
great O

question O
of O
all O
, O
was O
trembling O
on O
his O
lips O
, O
when O
Emmy B-PERSON
replied O
— O

“ O
Can O

otherwise O
? O

“ O

poor O

Dob B-PERSON
, O

his O
countenance O
fell O
. O
|

Emmy B-PERSON
did O
not O
note O
the O
circumstance O
at O
the O
time O

nor O
take O
imme- O

honest O
Dobbin B-PERSON

counte- O

assumed O
  O

she O
thought O

it O
afterwards O

And O
then O
it O
struck O

her O
, O
with O
inexpressible O
pain O
and O
mortification O
too O
, O
that O
it O
was O
William B-PERSON
who O

was O
the O
giver O
of O
the O
piano O
  O
and O
not O
George B-PERSON
, O
as O
she O
had O
fancied O
. O
It O
was O

not O
George B-PERSON

gift O
  O
the O
only O
one O
which O
she O
had O
received O
from O
her O
lover O

as O

she O
thought O
— O
the O
thing O
she O
had O
cherished O
beyond O
all O
others O
— O
her O
dearest O

relic O
and O
prize O
. O
She O
had O
spoken O
to O
it O
about O

melancholy O

on O
the O

weeping O
over O
them O
in O

silence O
. O
It O
was O
not O
George B-PERSON

relic O

It O
was O
valueless O
now O

The O
next O

time O
that O
old O
Sedley B-PERSON
asked O
her O
to O

she O

it O
was O
shockingly O
out O

that O

had O
a O
headache O

that O

Then O
, O
according O

her O
custom O

she O
rebuked O
herself O
for O
her O
pettishness O

and O
ingratitude O
, O

determined O

“ O
I O

I O

” O
|

| O
Emmy B-PERSON
laughed O
: O
she O
thought O
it O
was O
very O
likely O
the O

could O
do O

thus O
much O
. O

If O
there O

a O
sincere O
liking O
between O
George B-PERSON

the O
Major O
, O
it O
must O
be O
|
| O
confessed O
that O
between O
the O
boy O
and O
his O
uncle O
no O
great O
love O
existed O
. O
|
| O
George B-PERSON
had O
got O
a O
way O
of O
blowing O
out O
his O
cheeks O
, O
and O
putting O
his O
hands O
in O
|
| O
his O
waistcoat O
pockets O
, O
and O
saying O
, O
“ O
God O
bless O
my O
soul O
, O
you O
do O
n’t O
say O
so O
, O
” O
|
| O
so O
exactly O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
old O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
restrain O
|
| O
from O
laughter O
. O
The O
servants O
would O
explode O
at O
dinner O
if O
the O
lad O
, O
asking O

for O
something O
which O
was O
n’t O
at O
table O
, O
put O
on O
that O
countenance O

used O

| O
that O
favourite O
phrase O
. O
Even O
Dobbin B-PERSON
would O
shoot O
out O
a O
sudden O
peal O
at O
|
| O
the O
boy O

mimicry O
. O
If O
George B-PERSON
did O
not O
mimic O
his O
uncle O
to O
his O
face O
, O
it O
|
| O
was O
only O
by O
Dobbin B-PERSON

rebukes O

Amelia B-ORG

terrified O
entreaties O
that O

And O
the O
worthy O

haunted O
by O
a O
dim O
consciousness O
that O
the O

thought O
him O

ass O
, O
and O
was O

inclined O
to O

him O

The O

He O

from O
scarcely O
any O

the O

Though O

he O
lay O

He O

the O

it O

probable O
that O

it O

is O
possible O
that O

would O
not O
be O
very O
talkative O
, O

by O
no O

interesting O

interested O

it O
must O
be O
remembered O

that O
this O

He O
certainly O

She O
greeted O
her O

affectionate O
respect O
, O
and O
made O
a O
shrinking O
, O

but O
amicable O
, O
salutation O
to O
Major O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
as O
her O
instinct O
assured O
her O

at O
once O
, O
was O
her O
enemy O
, O
and O
had O
been O
speaking O
against O
her O
  O
and O
the O
|
| O
bustle O
and O
clatter O
consequent O
upon O
her O

brought O
Amelia B-PERSON
out O

who O
went O
up O
and O
embraced O
her O
guest O
with O
the O
greatest O
warmth O
, O
and O
|
| O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
the O
Major O
, O
except O
to O
fling O
him O
an O
angry O
look O
— O
the O
most O
|
| O
unjust O
and O
scornful O
glance O
that O
had O
perhaps O
ever O
appeared O
in O
that O
poor O
|
| O
little O
woman O
’s O
face O
since O
she O
was O
born O

But O
she O
had O
private O
reasons O

of O
her O
own O
, O
and O
was O
bent O
upon O
being O
angry O
with O
him O

And O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
|
| O
indignant O
at O
the O
injustice O
, O
not O
at O
the O
defeat O
, O
went O
off O
, O
making O
her O
a O
bow O
|
| O
quite O
as O
haughty O
as O
the O
killing O
curtsey O
with O
which O
the O
little O
woman O
chose O

to O
bid O
him O
farewell O

bustled O
about O
the O
apartments O
and O
installed O
her O
guest O
in O
her O

room O
with O
an O
eagerness O
and O
activity O
seldom O
exhibited O
by O
our O
placid O
little O

But O
when O
an O
act O
of O
injustice O
is O
to O
be O
done O
, O
especially O
by O
weak O

people O
, O
it O
is O
best O
that O
it O
should O
be O
done O
quickly O

Emmy B-PERSON
thought O

even O
written O
once O

twice O

but O
in O
a O
manner O
so O
unconstrainedly O
cold O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
woman O
felt O
now O
in O
her O

turn O
that O
she O

lost O

She O
brooded O
over O
those O

according O
to O
her O
wo O
nt O
  O
saw O
the O

herself O

spent O
it O
all O
out O

He O
loved O

no O

again O

her O
, O
she O
would O

At O

she O

the O

She O
wrote O

off O

on O

nor O
was O
any O

  O

only O
that O
she O

very O

agitated O
when O
Georgy B-PERSON
met O

she O

“ O

she O

altogether O

disappeared O
under O
the O
folds O

was O
kissing O
one O
of O
his O

hands O
with O
all O
her O
might O
  O
whilst O
the O

I O

was O
engaged O

holding O
her O

her O

in O
pre- O

venting O
her O

was O
murmuring O
something O

When O

tight O
hold O
of O
one B-CARDINAL

William B-PERSON

looked O
up O

It O
was O
full O
of O
sadness O

tender O
love O

She O
understood O
its O
reproach O
, O

hung O
down O
