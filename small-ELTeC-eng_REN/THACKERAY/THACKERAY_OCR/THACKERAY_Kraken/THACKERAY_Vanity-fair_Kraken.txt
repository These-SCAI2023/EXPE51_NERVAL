BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
As the MIanager of the Performance sits before the
eurtain on the bonrds, and looks into the Fuir, a feeling of
profound melancholy comes over him in his survey of the
bustling place. There is a great quantity of eating'and drink-
ing, making love and jilting, langhing and the contrary,
smoking, cheating, fighting, dancing, and fiddling: there are
bullies pushing about, bucks ogling the women, knaves picking
pockets, policemen on the look-out, quacks (other quacks,
plague take them l) bawling in front of their booths, and yokels
looking up at the tinselled dancers and poor old rouged
tumblers, while the light-fingered folk are operating upon their
pockets behind. Yes, this is VIrY FAIn; not a moral place
certainly; nor a merry one, though very noisy. Look at the
faces of the nctors nnd buffoons when they come off from their
business; and Tom Fool washing the paint off his chceks before
le sits down to dinner with his wife and the little Jack
Puddings behind the canvass. The curtain will be up presently,
nnd he will be turning over head and heels, and crying,
How are you f ''
A man with a reflective turn of mind, wnlking through
viii
BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
an exshibition of tis sort, will not be oppressed, I take it, by
his own or other people's hilarity. An episode of humour or
kindncss touches and amuses him here and there;-a pretty
child looking at a gingerbread stall; a pretty girl blushing
whilst her loer talks to her and chooses her fairing; poor Tom
Fool, yonder behind the waggon, mumbling his bone with the
honest family which lives by his tumbling;-but the general
impression is one more melancholy than mirthful. When you
come home, you sit down, in a sober, contemplative, not
unchnaritable frame of mind, and apply yourself to your books
or your business.
I have no other moral thnn this to tag to thc present
story of  Vanity Fair'' Some people consider Fairs immoral
altogether, mnd eschew such, with their servants and families:
perhaps they are right. But persons who think otherwise and
are of a lay, or a benevolent, or a sarcastie mood, may perhaps
like to step in for half an hour and look at the performauces.
There are scenes of nll sorts; some dreadful combats, some
grand and lofty horse-riding, some scenes of high life, nnd some
of very middling indeed; some love making for the sentimental,
and some light comic business: the whole accompanied by
appropriate scenery, and brilliantly illuminated with the
Author's own candles.
What more has the Manager of the Performance to say ?'-
To acknowledge the kindness witli which it has been received
in all the principal towns of England through which the Show
has passed, and where it has been most favourably noticed
by the respected conductors of the Public Press, and by the
Nobility and Gentry. He is proud to think that his Puppets
have given satisfaction to the very best company in this empire.
BEORE THRE CURTAIN.
The famons little Becky Puppet kas bcen pronouncei to be
uncommonly flexible in the joints and lively on the wire: the
Amelia Doll, though it has had a smaller circle of admirers,
has yct been cared and dressed with the greatest care by
the artist : the Dobbin Figure, though apparently clumsy, yet
dances in a very amusing and natural manner: the Little Boys'
Dance has becn liked by some; and please to remurk the richly
dressed figure of the Wicked Nobleman, on which no expense
has been spared, and which Old Nick will fetch away at th
end of this singular performance.
And with this, and a profound bow to his patrons, the
MIanager retires, and the curtain rises.

its teens, and on one sun-sliny
morning in June, there drove
up to the great iron gate of Miss
Pinkerton's acadeuy for young
Iadies, on Chiswick Mall, a large
family coach, with two fut horses
in blazing harness, driven by a
fat coachman in a three-cornered
hat and wig, at the rate of foun
miles an honr. A black servnnt,
who reposed on the box besile
the fat couchman, uncurled his
bandy legs as soon as the equi-
page drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's shining brass plate, and s hc
pulled the bell, at least n score of young heads were seen peering out of
the narrow windows of the stately old brick house. Nay, the acute
observer might have recognised the little red nose of good-naturel Miss
Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising oer some geranium-pots in the window
of that lady's own drawing-room.
' It is Mrs. Sedley's coaeh, sister,'' said Miss Jemima. Sambo, tle
black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman has a new rel
waistcoat.''
` Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss
Bedley's departure, Miss Jemima P'' asked Miss Pinkerton herself, thut
majestie lady: the emiramis of IIammersmith, the friend of Doctor
Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Chapone herself.
 The girls were up at four this morning, packing her trnks, sister,'i
repliel Miss Jemima; '`we have made her a bow-pot.''
vAITY FAIR.
 Say a bouquet, sister Jemima, 'tis more genteel.''
 Well, a booky as big almost as a hay-stack; I have put up two
bottles of the gillyflower-water for Mrs. Sedley, and the receipt for
making it, in Amelia's bor.''
''And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of Miss Sedley's

aceount. This is it, is it Very gool-ninety-three pounds, four shil-
lings. Be kind enough to address it to John Sedlcy, Esquire, and to sel
this billet which I hae written to his lsdy.''
In Mias Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister, Miss Pinker-
ton, was an object of as deep veneration, as would have been a letter from
a sovereign. Only when her pupils quitted the establishment, or when
they were about to be married, and once, when poor Miss Birch died of
the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to write personally to the
parents of her pupils; and it was Jemima's opinion that if anything cold
console Mrs. Birch for her daughter's loss, it would be that pious and
eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced the event.
In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's `` illet'' was to the following
efect:-
 7he Mall, Oliseick, Juns 15, 168-.
` MAx,-After her six years' residence at the Mal, I have the
honour and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Scdley to her parents,

as a young lady not nworthy to occwupy a fitting position in their polished
nnd refined circle. Those virtues which charucterise the young English
gentlewoman, those accomplishments which bceome her birth nnd station,
wiill not be found wanting in the aiable Miss Selley, whose induaftry
nnd ohedience hae endeared her to her instructors, and whose delightful
sweetness of tempcr has charmed her aged and her youlfl companions.
'`In music, in dncing, in orthography, in every variety of embroidery
and needle-work, she will be found to have realisel her friends' fodet
ishes. In geography there is still much to be desired; and a creful
and undeviating use of the backloard, for four hours duily during the
next three years, is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of thnt
dignified deportment and carriage, so requisite for every young lady of fshlion.
 In the principles of religion und norality, Miss edley will be founl
worthy of an establishnent whichi has been honoured by the presenee o1
Tle Great Leicograpler, and the patronage of the ndmirnbhle Mrs. Cha-
one. In leaving the MIall, Mliss Anelia carries with her the hearts of her
companions, and the affectionate regards of hcr mistress, who has thce
honour to subscribe herself,
Malam,
 Your most ohliged humble servant,
BABBAA PINETON.''
eP.S. Miss Slarp aceompanies Miss Sedley. It is partieularly re-
quested that Miss Sharp's stay in lussell Square may not exccl ten duys.
The family ol distinctian with whom she is cngaged, desire to avail them-
seles of her services as soon as possille,''
Ths letter eompleted, Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own nnme,
and Miss Sedley's, in the fty-leaf of a Johnson's Dictionnry-the inter-
esting work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on their
leparture from the Mnll. On the cover wns inserted a copy of `` Lines
ddressed to a young lnty on quitting Miss Pinkerton's sclool, at thc
Mall ; by the late revered Doctor Sumucl Johnson.'' In fact, the Lcxi-
cographer's nme wns always on the lips of this majestic woman, and a
visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation nnd her fortune.
Being commnndel by her elder sister to get ``the Dictionary'' fromn the
cupboard, Miss Jemims hd extractcd two copies of the hook fromn thc
receptale in qnestion. When Miss Pinkerton had finished the inscrip-
tion in thoe first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air, handed ler
the seeond.
 or whom is this, Miss Jemima ?'' snid Miss Pinkerton, with awful
zoldness.
 or Becky Sharp,'' mnswered Jemima, trembiing very mnch, and
blushing over her witherel face and ueck, as she turned her back on
her sister. For Bccky Sharp : she's going too.''
MISS JEMIMA .'' exelsimcd Miss Pinkerton, in tlo largest eapitals.
``Are you in your senses? Replace the Dixonary in the closet, and neer
ventnre to take such a liberty in future.''
WII, sister, it's only two-and-ninepence, aund poor Becky will be
nisernble if she lon't get one.''
n 2
VANITY AIIl.
Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,'' said Miss Pinkerton. Aud so
vcuturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly
tlurried aud nervous.
MIiss Sedley's papa was a merclant in London, nanl s man of some
wcaltl; whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil, for whom Miss ink-
erton had done, as she thought, quite enough, without conferring upon her
at parting, the high honour of the bDixonary.
Although Schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more nor less
than clurchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimcs happens that n person
lepurts this life, who is really dcserving of all thc prises the stone-cutter
carvcs over his bones; who is a gool Christian, a good parent, child, wife or
husbnud; who actually does leave a disconsolute family to mourn his loss;
so in academies of thc male and female sex it oecurs eery now and then,
thut the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bcstowed by the disinterested
instructor. Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular
aspecies; and deserved not only all tlat Miss linkerton suid in her praise, 
but had many charmiug qualities wlich that pompous old Minervn of a
woman could not see, from the differences of rank and age between her
pupil and herself.
For shc couldl not only sing like a lark, or a Mrs. Billington, nnd dance
like Hillisberg or 'urisot; and enibroider beauntifully; and spcll as well as
the Dixonary itselt; but sle had sucl a kindly, smiling, tender, gentle,
gcnerous heart of her own, ns won thc love of everybody who cme near
er, from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery, anl the
onc-cyed tartwoman's duaughtecr, who wus permitted to vend her wares once
a week to the young laudies in the Mall. She had twelve intimate and
bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladices. Even envious Miss
Briggs never spoke ill of ler: higl and mighty Miss Sultire (Lord Dexster's
grand-dauglter) allowel thiat her figure was genteel: and as for MIiss
nrtz, the rich woolly-haired mulatto from S5t. Kitt's, on the dny Ameclia
went away, she was in such a passion of tenrs, thnt they were obligel to
send for Dr. TFloss, and half tipsify her with salvolatile. Miss Pinkerton's
uttachcnt was, as may be supposed, from the high position and eminent
virtues of that lady, calm nud liguified; but Mliss Jemima had already
blubberecl several times at the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear
of her sister, would hve gone off in downright hysterics, like the heiress
(who pail donble) of St. Kitt's. Such luxury of grief, however, is only
allowed to parlour-boarders. Honest Jemima lad ull te bills, and the
washing, and the mendiug, and the puddings, and the plate and crockery,
nnd the servants to superintend. But why speak about hcr It is
probable that we shall not hear of her again from tlis moment to the end
of time, and that whcn the great filligrec iron gates are once closed on
her, sle and her awful sister will never issue tlerefrom into this little
world of history.
But as we are to see a great denl of Amelia, tlcre is no harm in saying
at the outset of our aequaintancc, that she was one of the best and denrest
creatures that evcr lived; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in
novcls, which (and the luatter especially) abound in villains of the most
somhre sort, that we nre to have for n constant companion, so guilelcss

and good-naturel a person. As she is not a heroine, there is no neod to
lescribe her person ; indeed I am afraid thut her nose was rather short
than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a
eroine; but her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the
freshest of smiles, and sle had a pair of eyes, which sparkled with tho
brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled with
tears, and that was a great deal too often ; for the silly thing would cry
over a dead canary-bird, or over a mouse, that the cat haply had seized
upon, or over the end of n novl, were it ever so stupid; and ns for saying
an unkind word to her, were any one hard-hearted enough to do so,-
why, so much the worse for them. Even Miss Pinkerton, tht austere
and god-like woman, ceasel scolding cr after the first time, and though
she no more comprehended sensibility than she did Algebra, gave all
masters and teachers particular orders to trent Miss Sedley with the utmost
gentleness, as harsh treatment was injurious to her.
So that when the dny of departure cme, betwecn her two customs of
laugluing and crying, Mliss Sedley was greatly puzled how toact. She was
glad to go home, and yet most wofully sad at leaving school. For tlurce
days before, little Lnura Martin, the orphan, followedl her about, likc a
little dog. She had to ake and receive at least fourteen presents,-to
make fourteen solemn promises of writing every wcek: ``Send my letters
under cover to my grandpapa, tle Earl of Dexter,'' said Miss Saltire (who,
by the way was rather shabby) : `` Never mind the postuge, but write every
day, you dear darling,'' said tho impetuous and woolly-headed, but gene-
ous anl affectionate Miss Swurtz; and little Laura Martin (who was just
in round hand) took her friend's land nnd snid, looking up in her fuce
wistfully, `Amelia, when I write to you I slull cull you Mamma.'' Al

will pronounce to be exeessively foolish, trivial, twaddling, and ultra-senti-
mnental. es; I can see Jones at this minute (rather flushed with his joint
of mutton nnd half-pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scoring under
the words `` foolish, twaddling,'' &c., and alding to them his own remark
of `` ouite true'' Well, he is a lofty ma of genius, and admires the grent
nud heroic in life and novels; and so hnd better take waruing aud go
elsewhere.
Well, then. The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, nnd bonuet-
boxes of Miss Sedley laving been arranged by Mr. Sambo in the carriage,
together with a very small and weuther-beaten old cow's-skin trunk
with Miss Sharp's cnrd neatly niled upon it, which was delivered by
ambo with a grin, and pcked by the coachman with n corresponding
sneer-tho hour for parting cnme; and the griof of that moment was
econsiderably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton
nddressel to her pupil. Not thnt the parting speech caused Amelia to
philosophise, or that it nrmed her in any way with a calmness, the result
of argument; but it was intolerably dull, popous, and tedious; and
having the fear of ler schoolmistress gretly before her eyes, Miss Sedley
did not venture, in her presence, to give wuy to any ebullitions of private
grief. A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were producel in the drawing-
room, as on the solemn oceasions of the visit of parents, and these refresh-
ments being partaken of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to dcpart.
 You 'll go in and say good by to Miss Pinkerton, Becky '' said Miss
Jemima to a young lady of wlom nobody took any notice, and who was
coming down stairs with her own handboxs.
 I suppose I must,'' said Miss Sharp calmly, and much to the wonler
of Miss Jemima; and the latter having knocked at the door, and reeciving
permission to come in, Miss Shnrp udvanced in a very uneoncerned man-
ner, and suid in French, and with a perfect accent, ``Mademoiselle, je viens
vous faire mes adieux.''
 Miss Pinkerton did not understand French; she only lireetel those
who did: but biting her lips and tlrowing up her venerable and Roman-
osed head, (on the to of which figured a large and solemn turban,) she
said, `` Miss Sharp, I wish yo a good morning.'' As the llammersmitl
Semiramis spokc, she waved one hnnd both by wny of adieu, and to givc
Miss Bhnrp an opportunity of shaking ono of the fingers of the land wlieh
was left out for thst purpose.
Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a vcry frigil smile nnd bow,
and quite declined to accept the proffered honour; on whicl Semirmis
tossed up ler turban more indignantly thmn ever. In faet, it was a little
battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter was worsted.
Heaven bless you, my child,'' ssid she, embracing Amelia, and scowling
the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp. ` Come away, Becky,''
said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great alarm, and the
drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.
Then came the struggle and parting below. Words refuee to tell it.
All the serants were there in the hall-all the dcar friends-nll the young
ladies-the dancing-master who had just arrived; and there was such a
scuffling, and hugging, and kissing, and crying, with the hysterical yoeps

 in tle lust chapter, and had seen the Dixonary flying

f-' f hatrcd, assumed a smile that perhaps was scarcely

more agreeable, and she sank back in the carriage in
n csy fme of minl, saying,-`` So much for the
Dixonary; and, thank God, I'm out of Chiswick.''
Miss Sedley was almost as flurried at the act of defiance as Miss Jemima
had been; for, consider, it was but one minute that she hal left school,
and the impressions of six ycars are not got over in that space of time.
Nay, with some persons those awes and terrors of youth last for ever and
evcr. I know, for instance, an old gcntleman of sixty-eight, who said
to me one moring at brekfast, will n very gitted countennce,  I
dreamed last night that I was flogged by Dr. ine.'' Funey had carried
him back five and fifty years in the course of that evening. Dr. Raine and
his rod were just as awful to him in his heart, then, at sixty-eight, as they
had been at thirteen. If the Doetor, with a large birch, had appeared
bodily to him, even at the age of threescore and eight, and had said in
awful voice, ` Boy, take down your pantes Well, well, Miss
Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination.
 How could you do so, RebeccaP '' at lset she said, ufter a pause.
 Why, do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back
to the black-hole '' snid Rebecca, laughing.
 No : but--''
I hate the whole house,'' continued Miss Sharp, in a fury. `` I hope
I may never set eycs on it again. I wish it were in the bottom of the
Thames, I do; and if Miss Pinkerton were there, I wouldn 't pick her out,
that I wouldn't. O how I should like to see her floating in the water
yonder, turban and all, with her train atreaming after her, and her nos
like the bek of a wherry,''
Hush I'' cried Miss Sedley.
e Why, wil the black footman tell tales2'' cried Miss Rebeeca, laughing.
He may go back and tell Miss Pinkerton that I hute her with all my
soul ; and I wish he would; and I wish I had a means of proving it too.
For two years I have only had insults and outrage from her. I have been
treated worse than any serant in the kitchen. I have never had n friend
or a kind word, except from you. I have been made to tend the little girls

in the lower schoolroom, and to talk French to the Misses, until I grew
sick of my mother-tongue. But that talking Freuch to Miss linkerton
was capital fun, wasn't itP She docsn't know a word of French, anl was
too proud to confess it. I believe it was that which made her purt with
ne; and so thunk Heaven for French. ie la France 1 ioe l'lwpereur l
ise BonaparteI''
O Rebecca, Rebecn, for shamel'' cried Miss Seley ; for tlis was
the greatest blasphemy Rebccca had ns yet uttered; and in those dys, in
England, to say ``Long live Bonaparte I'' was as much as to say ``Loug
live Lucifer1''  IIow can you-how dure you have such wickcd,
revengeful thoughts''
` Revenge may be wicked, but it 's nutural,'' answered Miss ebecca.
 I 'm no angel.'' And, to say the truth, she eertainly was not.
For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which
took place as the conch rolled long lazily by the river side) that though
Miss Rebeeca Sharp has twicve had occasion to thank Heaven, it has been,
in the first place, for ridding her of some person whom she hated, and
secondly, for enabling her to bring her enemies to some sort of perplexity
or confusion ; neither of which are very nmiable motives for religious
gratitude, or such as would be put forward by persons of a kind aud
placble disposition. Miss Rebeccen was not, tlen, in the least kind or
placable. All the world used her ill, said this young misanthropist (or
nisogynuist, for of the world of men she can be pronouuced as yet to have
had but little experience), and we may be pretty certain that the persons
of either sex wlom nll the world treats ill, deserve entirely the trcntment
they get. The world is a looking-gluss, and gives buek to every mun the
reflection of his own face. lFrow at it, and it will in turmn look sourly
pon you: luangh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion ; and
so let all young persons take their choice. This is ccertuin, that if the
world neglected Miss Sharp, she never was known to have done a good
action in behlf of anybody; nor can it be expccted that twenty-four
young ladies should all be as amiable as the heroine of this work, Miss Selley
(wham we have selected for the very rcason that she was the best-naturcd
of all, otherwise what on earth was to have prevented us from putting up
Miss Swartz, or Miss Crump, or Miss Hopkins, as heroine in her place?)
it could not bo expectel that every one should be of the humble and gentlc
temper of Miss Amelia Sedley; should take every opportunity to vanquish
lehecca's hard-heartedness and ill-humour; and, by a thousand kind worls
and offiees, overcome, for once at least, her lostility to her kind.
Miss Sharp's fther was an artist, and in that qunlity had given lessons
of drawing at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man; a pleasant
companion; a careless student; with a great propensity for running into
lebt, and a partiality for the tavern. When he was drunk, he used tc
eat his wife and daughter; and the next moruing, with a hcndache, he
used to ril at the world Ior its neglect of his genius, and abuse, with a
good deal of cleverness, and eometimes wth perfect reason, the fools, his
hrother painters. As it was with the utmost difficulty that he could kecep
limself, and as he owed money for a mile round Soho, where he lived, he

thought to better his circumstanees by marrying a young woman of the
French nation, who was by profession an opera-girl. The humble calling
of her female parent, Miss Sharp never alluded to, but used to state subse-
quently that the Entrechats were a noble family of Gascony, nnd took
great pride in her descent from them. And curious it is, that as she
advanced in life this young lady's ancestors inereased in rank and
splendour.
Rebecca's mother had had some education somewhere, and her dughter
spoke French with purity and a Parisian aceent. It was in those days
rather a rare accomplishment, anl led to her engagement with the orthodox
Miss Pinkertou. For her mother being dead, her father, finding him-
self not likely to recover, after his third attack of delirium tremess, wrote
a manly and pathietic letter to Miss Pinkerton, recommending the orphan
child to her protection, and so descended to the grave, after two bailiffs
had quarrelled over his corpse. Rebecca was seventeen when she came to
Chiswick, and was bound over as an articlel pnpil; her duties being to
talk French, as we have seen, and her privileges to live cost free, and,
wth a few guineas a year, to gather scraps of kowledge from the professors
who attended the school.
She wss small and slight in person; pale, sandy-hired, and with eyes
habitually cast down: when they looked up they wcre very large, odd, and
attraetive; so attracetive, that the Reverend Mr. Crisp, fresh from Oxford,
and curate to the Vicar of Chiswick, the Reverend M. Flowerdew, fell in
love with Miss Sharp; being shot dead by a glanee of her eyes which was
fired all the way across Chiswiek Chureh from the school-pew to the
reading-desk. This infatnated young man used sometimes to take tes
with MIss Pinkerton, to whom he had been presented by his mamma, and
aetually proposed something like marriage in an intereepted note, which
the one-eyed applewoman was charged to deliver. Mrs. Crisp was sum-
moned from Buxton, and abruptly cnrried off her darling boy; but the
iden, even, of such an eagle in the Chiswick dovecot cnused a great flutter
in the breast of Miss Pinkerton, who would huave sent nway Miss Sharp, but
that she was bound to her under a forfeit, and who never could thoroughly
believe the young lady's protestations that she had never exchanged a single
word with Mr, Crisp, except under her own eyes on the two oceasions
when she had met him at tea.
By the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the establishment,
Rebecca Sharp looked like a child. But she had the dismal precocity of
overty. Many a dun had she talked to, and turned away from her father's
door; many a tradesman had shc conxed and wheedled into good-humour,
and into the granting of one meal more. She sate commonly with her
father, who was very proud of her wit, nnd heard tle talk of many of his
wild companions-often but ill suited for a girl to hear. But she neer
had been a girl, she said; she had been a woman since she was eight years
old. O why did Miss Pinkerton let such a dangerous bird into her cage
The fact is, the old lady thought Rebecca to be the meekest ereature in
the world, so admirably, on the occnsions when her father brought her to
Chiswick, used Rebeccu to perform the part of the ingenae. She thought
her n modest and innocent little ehild; and only a year before the arrange-

ment by which Rebecca had been admitted into ler house, und when Rebeccn
was sixteen years old, Miss Pinkerton majestically, and with alittle speech,
made her a present of a doll-which was, by the way, the confiscated pro-
perty of iss Swindle, discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school-
hours. How the father and daughter laughed ass they trudged home
together after the evening party, (it was on the oecasion of the speeches,
when all the professors were invited,)and how Miss Pinkerton would have

he cntastrophe cnme, and she was brought to tle Mall as to her home.
The rigid formaulity of the place suffocated her: the praycrs and the meals,
the lessons and the walks, which were arranged with a conventunl regu-
larity, oppressed her almost beyond endurance: and she looked back to
the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in Soho with so much
regret, that everybody, herself ineluded, fancied she ws consmed with
grief for her father. She hnad a little room in the garret, where the maids
heard her walking and sobbing at night; but it was with rage, and not
with grief. She had not been much of a dissembler, until now her loneli-
ness taught her to feign. She hd never mingled in the society of women:
her father, reprobate as he was, was n man of talent ; his conversation
was a thousand times more agreeable to her than the talk of such of her
own sex as she now encountered. The pompous vauity of the old school-
mistress, the foolish good-humour of her sister, the silly chat and scandal
of the elder girls, and the frigil correcetness of the goverucsses equally
annoyed her; and she kad no soft maternal henrt, this unlucky girl, other-
wise the prattle and talk of the younger children, with whose care she was
chiefly intrusted, might have soothed nnd interestel her; but she lived
among them two yeurs, and not one was sorry that she went away. he
gentle tender-hearted Amelin Sedley was the only person to whom she could
uttach hersclf in the least ; and who could hclp attaching herself to Amelia?
The happiness-the superior advantages of the young women round
about her, guave lebeccu inexpressible pangs of envy.  What airs that
girl gives herself, because she is nn Enrl's grandlaughter,'' she sunid of one.
How they cringe and bow to thnt Creole, because of her hundred
thousand poundsl I am a thousand times cleverer and more charming
than that creature, for all her wealth. I am as well bred as the Euarl's
granddaughter, for all her fine pedigree; and yet every one passes me by
here. Aud yet, when I was at my futher's, did not the men give up their
gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?'' She
determined nt any rate to get free from the prison in which she found
herself, and now began to act for hcrself, and for the first timo to make
connected plans for the future.
She took advantage, therefore, of the means of study the place offored
her; and as she was alrcady a msician anl a good linguist, she spceedily
went through the little coursc of study which was considered necessary for
ladies in those days. IIer music she practisel iucessantly, and one ay,
when the girls wcre out, nnd she had remained at home, she wns ovcr-
heard to play a piece so well, that Minerva thought wisely, she coull
spare herself the expense of a master for the juniors, and intimated to
Miss Slarp that she was to instruet them in music for the future.
The girl refusel; and for the first time, and to the astonishment of the
majestic mistress of the school. `I am here to spcak French with the
children,'' Rebeccn said abruptly, ``not to teach them music, and save
money for you. Give mo money, and I will teach them.''
Minerva was obliged to yield, and, of course, disliked her from that dny.
 For fie-and-thirty years,'' she said, and with great justice, I never

ave seen the individual who has dared in my own house to question my
nuthority. I have nourished a viper in my bosom.''
 A viper-a fiddlestick,'' said Miss Sharp to the old luly, almost fint-
iug with astonishment. ``You took me because I was useful. There is no
question of gratitude between us. I hnte this place, and want to lenve it,
I will do nothing here, but what I am obliged to do.''
It wus in vain that the old laly asked her if she ws aware she was
speaking to Miss Pinkerton lebeccas lasughed in her face, with n lorrid
uarcastic demoniacal laughter, that almost sent the schoolmistress into fits.
Give me a sum of money,'' said the girl, ``nnd get rid of me-or, if you
like better, get me a gool place as governess in a nobleman's family-you
can do so if you please.'' And in their further disputes she alwuays
returned to this point, ` Gct me a situation-we hute each other, and I
um ready to go.''
Worthy Miss Pinkerton, although she had a Ronan nose and a turbnn,
and was ns tall as a grenadier, and hd been up to this time an irresistible
princess, had no will or strength likc that of er little apprentice, and in
vauin did battle agninst her, and tried to overawe her. Attempting once
to seold her in public, Rebecca hit upon the before-mentioued plan of
answering hcr in French, which quite routed the old woman. In order to
uaintain authority in her school, it became necessury to remove this rebel,
this monster, this serpent, this firebrand; and hearing about this time
that Sir Pitt Crnwley's fuily was in want of a governess, shc uctually
recommenlded Miss Shnrp for the situation, firebrand and serpent as she
was. ''I cannot, certninly,'' she said, ''find fault witl Miss Shrp's con-
duct, except to myself; and must allow thnt her talents and accom-
plishments are of a high orler. As fnr ans the head goes, nt least, she
does credit to the educutional system pursuoel at y cstablishmcnt.''
And so the schoolmistress rcconciled the recommendation to her con-
science, and the indentures were cnneelled, and the apprenticc wns free.
The battle here deseribed in a few lines, of coursc, lasted for some months.
And as MIiss Selley, bcing now seventcen years of age, was ubout to lcavc
school, and hnd a friendship for Miss Sharp, (`` 'tis the only point in
Amelia's behaviour,'' snid Minerva, '`which hns not been satisfuctory to
her mistress,'') Miss Sharp was invited by her friend to pass a week with
her at home, before she entered upon her duties as governess in a private
Iamily.
Thus the world begnn for these two young ladies. For Amelia it was
quite a new, fresh, brilliant world, with all the bloom upon it. It wns not
quite a new one for Rcbececa-(indeed, if the truth must be told with
respect to the Crisp affair, the tart-woman hinted to somcbody who took
nn affiduvit of tle fact to somcbody else, that there was a great deal more
than was made public regarding Mr. Crisp unl Miss Sharp, and that his
letter was in aneser to another letter). But who ean tell you thc rcnl truth
of the matter At all events, if cbecca was not beginning the world,
she was bcginning it over again.
By the time the young ladies renched Kensington turnpike, Amelin hnd

spied her as he was riding by, and said, ``A dem fine gl, egall'' and
hefore the carriage arrived in Russell Square, a great deal of conversation
hal taken place about the drawing-room, and whether or not young laaies
wore powder as well as hoops when presented, and whether she was to
have that honour: to the Lord Mayor's ball she knew she was to go.
And when at length home was reached, Miss Amelia Sedley skipped out on
Sambo's arm, as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole big city
of London. Both he and coachman agreed on this point, and so did her
futher and mother, and so did every one of the servants in the house, as
they stood bobbing, and curteeying, and smiling, in the hall, to welcomc
their young mistress.
You may be sure tht she showed Rebecca oer every room of the
house, and everything in every one of her drawers ; and her books, and
her piano, and her uresses, and all her necklaces, brooches, laces, and
gimcracks. She insisted upon Rebecca accepting the white cornelian and
the turquoise rings, and a sweet sprigged muslin, which was too small for
her now, though it would fit her friend to a nieety; and she determined
in her heart to ask her mother's permission to present her wlite Cashmerc
shawl to her friend. Could she not spare it? and had not her brother
Joseph just brouglt her two from India?
When Rebecca saw the two agnificent Cashmere shawls which Joseph
Sedley had brought,home to his sister, she said, with perfect truth, ``thut
it must be delightful to have a brother,'' and easily got the pity of thc
tender-henrted Amelia, for being alone in the world, an orphan without
frienls or kindred.
:Not alone,'' said Amelia, ``' you know, Rebecca, I shll always be your
friend, and love you as a sister-indeed I will.''
`'Ah, but to have parents, as you lave-kind, rich, affectionate parents,
who give you everything you ask for; and their love, which is more pre-
cious than all1 My poor papa could give me nothing, and I had but twa

that she expected to see a number of Anelia's nephews and niceces. She
was quite disappointed tlat Mr. Sedley was not marricd; she was sure
Amelia had said he was, and she doted so on little children.
I think you must have had enough of them at Chiswick,'' sail Amelia,
rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friend's pnrt; and indeed
in later days Miss Sharp woull never hare committed herself so fur as to
ndvance opinions, the untruth of which would have been so easily detected.
But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet, unused to the art
of deceiving, poor innocent creaturel and making her own exrperience in
her own person. The meaning of the above series of queries, as trans-
lated in the heart of this ingenious young woman, was simly this:-`If
Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why should I not mrry him
I hae only a fortnight, to be sure, but there is noharmintrying.'' And she
determined within herself to make this laudnble attempt. She redonbled
her caresses to Amelia; she kissed the white cornelian necklace as she put
it on; and owed she would never, never port with it. When the dinner-
bell rang she went down stairs with her arm round her friend's waist, as
is the habit of young ladies. She was so agitated at the drawing-room
door, that she aould hardly find courage to enter. ` Feel my heart, how
it beats, dear1'' nid she to her friend.
 No, it doesn't,'' said Amelia. `' Come iu, don't be frightened. Papa
wont do you any harm.,''

hid his entire face alnost in his neekcloths at tlis apparition.
It's only your sister, Joseph,'' sait Amelia, laughing and shaking thc
two fingers which he held out. :I 've come hoe fr good yon know;
and this is my friend, Miss Sharp, whom you have leard me mention,.''
No, neer, upon my worl,'' said the head under the neckcloth, shak-
ing very mueh,-`` that is, yes,-what nbominably cold weuther, Miss;''-
nnd herewith he fell to poking the fire with all his might, although it was
in the middle of June.
 He's very handsome,'' whispered Rebecca to Amelia, rather loudl.
 Do you think so:'' said the latter,  I 'lI tell lim.''
Drling l not for worlds,'' sail Miss Sharp, starting back us timid
as a fuwn. She hnd previously made a respecetful virgin-like curtsey tao
the gentlemnn, and her nodest eyes gazed so perseveringly on the carpet
thrat it was a wonder how she should have found an opportunity to see him.
 Thank you for the beautiful shawls, brotler,'' said Amelia to the fire-
poker. ``Are thcy not beautiful, Rebereu ?''
O heavenly'' said Miss Shnrp, and her eycs went from thc carpet
straight to the chandelier.
oseph still continued a huge elattering at the poker and tongs, puffing
and blowing the while, and turuing as red as his yellow face would allow
him. I can't mkc you such handsome prcsents, Joseph,'' continucd his
sister, ``but while I wus at school, I have cbroidered for you a very
beautiful pair of braces,''
 Good Gnd l Amelia,'' eriel the brother, in serious alarm, `` what do

But in this dress it 's impossible.''
 Look at him, isn't he lnlsome enough to dine anywhere, Miss

On which, of coursc, Miss Sharp looked at her friend, and they both scet
off in a fit of laughter, highly agreeable to the oll gentleman.
 Did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at Miss Pinkerton's''
continued he, following up his audvantnge.
 Gracious heavensI Father,'' ceried Joseph.
e There now, I have hurt his feelings. Mra. Selley, y dear, I have

do her very best to secure the hsbaud, who was even more necessary for
her than for her friend. She had a vivid imaginuation; she had, besides,
read the ``Arabian Nights'' and `` Guthrie's Geograsphy,'' and it is a fact,
that while she was dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia
whether her brother was very rich, she had built for herself a most magni-
ficent castle in the air, of which she was mistress, with a husband some-
where in the baekgroud (she had not seen him as yet, and his figure
would not therefore be very listinct); she had arruyed herself in an infinity
of shawls, turbans, and diamond necklaces, and had mounted upon an
elephant to the sound of the march in Bluebeard, in order to pay a visit of
ceremony to the Grand Mogl. Charming Alnaschar visions l it is the

Joseph Sedley was twelve years older than his sister Mmelia. He wns in
the Eost India Company's Civil ervice, and his name appeared, at the
eriod of which we write, in the Bengal division of the East India Register,
as collector of Boggley Wollnh, an honourable and lucrative post, as every-
body knows: in order to know to what higher posts Joseph rose in the
service, the render is referred to the same periodical.
Boggley Wollah is situated in a fine, lonely, marshy, jungly district,
iamous for suipe-shooting, and where not unfrequently you may flush a
tiger. Ramgunge, where there is a magistrate, is only forty miles off,
nd there is a cavalry station about thirty miles farther; so Joseph wrote
home to his parents, when he took possession of his colleetorship. lIe
had lived for about eight yenrs of his life, quite alone, at this charm-
iug place, scarcely seeing a Christian fuce, except twice a year, when the
detachment arrived to carry off the evenues wlhich he had oollected, to
Calcutta.
Luckily, at this time he caught a liver complaint, for the cure of whieh
hc returned to Europe, and which was the source of great comfort
and amusement to hi in his native country. He did not lie with his
family while in London, but hnd lodgings of his own, like a gay young
bachelor. Before he went to India he was too young to partake of the
delightful pleasures of a man about town, and plunged into them on his
return, with considerable assiduity. He drove his horses in the l'ark;
he dined nt tlce fashionable taverns, (for the Oriental Club was not as
yet invented); he frequented the theatres, as the mode was in tlose days,
or mude his appearnnce at the opera, laboriously attired in tights and a
coecked hat.
On returuing to India, and ever after, e used to talk of the pleasure of
this period of his existnee with great enthusiasm, and give you to under-
stand that he and lBrummel were the leading bucks of the day. But h
was as lonely here as in his jungle at Boggley Wollah. lIe searcely kue
n single soul in the netropolis: and were it not for his doctor, and the
society of his blue-pill, and his liver complaint, he must have died of lone-
liness. He was lazy, peevish, and a bon-vioant;: the appearance of a lady
frightened him beyond measure; hence it was but seldom that he joine
the paternal circle in Russell Square, where there was plenty of guiety, and

where the jokes of lis good-aturcl old father frightened his auor-propre.
His bulk caused Joseph much anxious thought und alarm; now nnd then
he would muke a desperuate attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat;
but his indolence and love of gool living speedily got the better of these
endeavours at reform, and he found himself again at his three meals a duy.
lIe never was well dressed; but he took the hugest pnins to adorn his
big person, and pnssed many hours daily in tlt occupation. His valct
made a fortune out of his wardrobe : his toilet-tnble wns covered with ns
any pomatums and csscnces as ever were employcd by an old beauty:
he hal tried, in order to give hiself n wist, cvery girth, stay, and wnist-
bund then invented. Iike ost fat men, he woud hmave his elothes made
too tight, and took care they should be of the most brillinnt colours
anl youthful cut. When drssed at length, in the aftecrnoon, he would
issue forth to take a drive with nobody in the lark; nnd then would come
back in order to dress again and go and dine with nobody nt the Piazzn
Coffee-House. lIe was as vain as a girl; and perhps his extrcme shyness
was one of the rcsults of his cxtrene vunity. If Miss Rebcecn can get the
better of him, and at her first entrance into life, she is a young person of
no ordinary cleverness.
The first move showed considerable skill. Wen shc cnlled Scdley n
very handsooe man, she knew that Amelia would tell her mother, whn
would probbly tell Joseph, or who, at any rate, would be plcasel by thlc
compliment paid to her son. All mothwers are. If you hnd told Sicornxs
that her son Caliban wns as hnndsoe as Apollo, she would have been
pleased, witch as she was. Perhaps, too, Joseph Sedley would overhear
the compliment-Rebeccea spoke loud enough-and he did henr, anl (think-
ing in his heart that he was a vcry fine man,) the prnise thrilled through
every fibre of his big body, anl made it tingle with plensure. Then, how-
ever, came a recoil. `` Is the girl making fun of meP'' he thought, and
straightwa he bounced towardse the hell, annl was for retreating, as we
hnve seen, when his father's jokes and his mothior's entrenties caused himn
to pause and stay where he was. Ie conductcd the young lady down to
dinner in a dubious and agilated frame of ind. :Does she renlly think
I am handsome'' thoughlt he, `` or is shle only making game of me'' WY
have talkel of Joscph Scley bcing as vain as a girl. Heaven lelp usl the
girls have only to turn the tablcs, and say of oue of their own scx, ' She is
as vain as a man,'' sd they will hanve perfeet reason. The beardcd crca-
tures are quite as eager for praise, quite as fiuikin over their toilettes, quile
as proud of their personal advantages, quite as conscious of thceir powers of
fasciuation, as any couette in the world.
Down stirs, then, they went, Joseph very rel and blunshing, Hebeeca
very modest, nnd holding her green eyes downwards. She wns dressed
in white, with bnre shoulders ns white ans snow-the picture of youth,
unprotected innocence, and humble virgin simplicity. ` I must be very
quiet,'' thought Rebeee, `` nnd very uch interested about India.''
Now we have heard how Mrs. Sedley hud prepared n fine curry for her
son, just as he liked it, and in the course of dinner a pnortion of this dish
was offerel to Rebecea. : What is it?'' sail she, turning an appenling
look to Mr. Joseph.

`'A clili,'' snid RRebecca, gasping. 'Oh yes'' She thought a elili was
something cool, as its name imported, and was served with some. ` 1Iow

nssure you,'' snid he. ``Sanbo, give Miss Sharp some water.''
he paternal laugh was echoed by Joseph, who thought the joke capital.
The ladics only siled a liutle. hey thought poor ebecea suffered tou

mortilication as well as she lad thc abominable curry before it, and as

inquire about the liver and the blue-pill.
Being an invalid, Joseph Sedley contented himself with a bottle of claret
besides his Mndeira at dinner, and he mnnaged a couple of plates full of
strawberries and cream, and twenty-four little rout ckes, that were lying
neglected in a plate near him, and certainly (for novelists have the privilege
of knowing eerything), he thought n great denl about the girl up stairs.

oon Joe's panie lastel for to or three
days; during which he did not visit
the louse, nor during that period did
Miss Rebeccn ever mention his name.
She was all respectful gratitude to
Mrs. Sedley; deliglted beyond mea-
sure nt the azaars; and in a whirl of
wonder at the theatre, whither the
good-natured lady took her. Onc
day, Amclia had a head-ache, and
could not go upon some party of
pleasure to which the two young
people were invited: nothing could
induce her irienl to go without her.
 Whntl you who have shown the
poor orphan what happiness and love are for the first time in her life-
quit you' never.'' und the green eycs looked up to Icven and filled
with tears ; and Mrs. Seley could not but own that her daughter's friend
had a charming kind henrt of her own.
As for Mr. Sedley's jokes, Rebhecea lugled at tlem with a cordialiy
und perseerance which not a little pleascd aud softened that good-natured
gentleman. Nor was it with the chiefs of the family alone that Miss
Sharp found favour. She interested Mrs. Blenkinsop by cviucing thc
deepest sympathy in the raspberry-jam preserving, which operation was
then going on in tle IIousekeeper's room ; she persisted in calling Sama
 Sir,'' and ` Mr. Snmbo,'' to the delight of that attendant; anl she
apologised to the lady's maid for giving her tronble in venturing to ring
the bell, with such swectness and humility, that the Servants' Hall ws
almost as charmed with her as the Drawing Room.
Once, in looking ovcr some druwings which Amelin hnd sent from
school, kebecca suddenly cme upon one which caused her to burst into
teurs and leave the room. It was on the dny when Joe Scdley made his
second appearancee.
Amelia hastened after her friend to know thc cause of this display of
feeling, and the good-natucl girl came back witlout her compaion,
rather affected too.  You know, ler father was our lrawing-master.

taking good-uatured Mrs, Sedley's extended hand and kissing it respeet-
fully.  How kind you oll are to me. All,'' sle addel, with a laugh,
``except you, Mr. Joseph.''

per-dish at dinner, the first day I eer saw you ou are not so good to

 Perhaps there was not enough citron juice in it;-no, there was not.''
 And the chilis P 
I3y Jove, how they made you cry out.'' snid Joe, cauglt by the ridi-
cule of the circumstanee, and exploding in a fit of laughter which ended
quite suddenly, as usual.
I shuall take care how I let you choose for me another time,'' said
Rebececa, as they went down again to dinner. `I diin't think men were
fond of putting poor hsrmless girls to pain.''
IBy Gad, Miss Rebecca, l1 wouldn't hurt you for the world.''
 No,'' said she, `` I owe you wouldn't;'' and then she gave him over
so gentle a pressure with her little hand, and drew it back quite frightened,
nnd looked first for one instant in his face, and then down at the cnrpet-
rods; and I am not prepared to say that Joe's heart did not thump at
this little involuntary, timid, gentle motion of regard on the part of thc
simple girl.
It was an advance, and as such, perhaps, some ladics of indisputable
correctness and gentility will condemn the action as immodest; but, you
see, poor dear ebecca had all this work to do for herself, If a person
is too poor to keep a servant, though ever so elegant, he must sweep his own
rooms : if a dear girl has no dear Manmma to settle matters with the young
man, she must do it for herself. And oh, what a mercy it is that thesc
women do not exercise their powers oftener1 We cnn't resist them, if
they do. Let them slow ever so little inclination, and men go down on

thnt thc darlings are like the beasts of the field, and don't know their own

`Egad :'' thought Joseph, entering the dining-room, '`I cxactly begin
to feel as I did at Dumdum with Miss Cutler.'' Many sweet little appels,
half tenler, alf joeular, did Miss Sharp make to him aout the dishes at
dinner; for by this time sle was on a footing of consideruble faniliarity
with the family, and as for the girls, tley loved each other like sisters.
oung unmarried girls always do, if tlcy arc in a house together for ten

``Let Joe go,'' sil his fatler, laughiog.  He's ig enough.'' A1
which speech even Mr. Sambo at the sideboard burst out laughing, and
goor fat Joe felt inclined to become a parricide almost.
 Unlo his stays l'' continued the pitiless old gentleman.  Fling some
water in lis face, Miss Sharp, or carry him up stairs : the dear creature's

Order Mr. Jos's elephant, Sambo1'' criel the father. `Send to
Exeter 'Change, Sambo;'' but seeing Jos realy almost to cry with vexa-
tion, the old joker stopped his laughter, and sail, holding out his hand to
his son, ` It's all fuair on the Stoek-Exchange, Jos,-and, Sambo, never
nind the elephant, but give me and Mr. Jos a glass of Champague. Boney
limself hasn't got such in his cellar, my boy1''
A goblet of Champagne restored Joseph's equanimity, and before the
ottle was emptied, of which as an invalid he took two-thirds, he had
greel to take the young ladies to Vauxhall.
The girls must have a gentleman apieee,'' said the old gentleman.
'`Jos will be sure to leave ELmmy in the crowd, he will be so taken up with
Miss Slarp here. Send to 86, and ask George Osborne if he'll come.'
At this, I don't know in tle lest for wlt reason, Mrs. Sedlcy looked
at her husband and lsughed. Mr. Sedley's eyes twiukled in n manner
indescribably roguish, and he looked at Amelia,; and Amelia hanging
lown her head, blushed as only young ladies of seventeen know how to
lush, and as Miss ebecca Shurp never blushed in her life-ut least not

Thnt was ycars ago,'' said Ameliu.
It seems like yesterday, don't it, Joln?'' snil Mrs. Sedley to her hus-
band; and that night in a conversntion which took place in a front room
in the second-floor, in a sort of tent, hung rounl with chintz of a rich and
fantastic India pattern, and donble' with cnlico of a tender rosc-colour; in
the interior of which species of mnrquee was n feather-bhed, on which werc
two pillows, on which were two round red fnces, one in a laced nightcap, and
one in n iimle cotton one, ending in a tassel :-in a curtain lecture, I
sny, MIrs. Sedley took her husband to task for his cruel conluct to poor
Joc.
It was quite wickced of you, Mr. Sedley,'' said she, ``to torment tlc
poor boy so.''
My denr,'' snid the cotton-tasscel in lefence of his conduct, `' Jos is
n great deal vainer than you ever were in your life, und that 's sayiug u
good denl. Though, some tirty yenrs ago, in the year seventeen hunlrel

out-Josephing Joseph, my dear, and all the while the loy is only thinking
of himself, and what a fine fellow he is. I doubt, Ma'am, wc shall hve
some trouble with him yet. Here is Emmy's little friend making love tao

him some other will. That man is destined to be a prey to woman, ns I

with great energy.

himself.''
And presently the voices of the two speakers were hushed, or werc
replaced by the gentle but unromantic music of the nose; and snve whcn
the church bells tolled the hour nnd the wtchman cnlled it, all was silent
at the house of John Sclley, Esquire, of ussell Square, and the Stock
Exchange.
When morning came, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley no longer thought
of executing her threats with regard to Miss Shrp; for though nothing
is more keen, nor more common, nor more justifiable, than maternal
jealousy, yet she oould not bring herself to suppose that the little, humble,
grateful, gentle goerness, would dare to look up to such a magnificent
ersonage as the Collector of Boggley Wollah. The petition, too, for an
extension of the young lady's leave of absence had already bcecn despatched,
and it would be difficult to find a pretext for abruptly dismissing her.

VANIT PAIR.
And as if all things conspired in faour of the gentle Rebecca, the very
vclements (allhough she was not inclined at first to acknowledge their
aotion in her bchalf) interposed to aid her. For on the evening appointcd
for thoe auxhall party, George Osborne havring come to dinner, and the
elders of tle house laving departed, according to invitation, to dine with
Alderan Balls, at Higlbury Barn, there came on such a thuuder-storm
as only happens on Vauxhall nights, and as obliged the young people,
perforcee, to remain at home. Mr. Osborne did not seem in the lest dis-
appointed at this occurrence. Ho and Joseph Sedley drank a fitting
quantity of port-wine, tete-a-teite, in the dining-room,-during the drinking
of which Sedley told a number of is best Indian stories ; for he was ex-
tremely talkative in man's society ;-and nfterwards Miss Amelia Sedley
did the honours of the drawing-room; and these four young persons
passed such a comfortable evening together, that they declared they were
rather glal of the thunder-storm thnn otherwise, wlich had caused thcm
to put off tleir visit to Vauxhall.
Osborue was Sedley's godson, and had been one of the family any time
these threc-and-twenty years. At six weeks old, he had received fromn
John Sedley a present of a silver cup; at six months old, a coral with
gold whistle and bells; from his yonuth, upwurds, hs was ``tiped'' regu-
larly by the old gentleman at Christmas: and on going back to school,
he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by Joseph edley, when the
latter was a big, svaggering, hobbadyhoy, and George an impudent urchin
of ten years old. In a word, George was as familiar with the family ns
such duily acts of kindness and intercourse could make him.
Do you remenber, Scdley, what a fury you were in, when I cut off
the tassels of your Hcssian boots, and how Miss-hem l-how Aielia
escued me from a beuting, by falling down on her knees and crying out
to her brother Jos, not to bent little George P''
Jos remnembered this remarknble circurstance perfectly wcll, but voed
that he ha totally forgotten it.
 Well, do you remembcr coming own in a gig to Dr. Swishtail's, to
see mc, before you went to Iudia, and giving me half a guinea and a pt
on the head I always had an iden that you were at least seven fcet
high, and was quite astonished at your return from India to find you no
taller than myself.''
lIow good of Mr. Sedley to go to your school nnl givse you thc
money 1'' exclaimed Rebecca, in accents of etreme deliht,
 es, and after I had cut the tassels of his boots too. Boys never
forget thse tips at school, nor the givers.''
I delight in Iessian boots,'' said Rebecca. Jos Selley, who admired
his own legs prodigiously, aud nlways woro his ornnamental chaussure, was
extremely pleased at this remark, though he drew his legs under his chair
as it was made.
Miss Slarpl'' said George Osborne, ``you who are so clever an artist,
you must make a grand historical picture of the scene of the oots. Sedley
shuall be representcd in bucekskins, and holding one of the injured boots in

'I shan't have time to do it here,'' said lebecca.  I 'll do it when-
when I am goe.'' And she dropped her voice, and lookel so sad and
piteous, that everyboly felt how cruel her lot wus, and how sorry they
would be to part with her.
O that you could stay longer, car Rebeeca,'' snid Mmelia.
 Why ?'' answerel the other, still more sadly. `` That I may be only
the more unlp-unwilling to lose you'' Anud she turned away her
hesl. Amelia began to give way to thnt natural infirmity of tears wlich,
we lave said, was one of the defccts of tlis silly little thing. George
Osborne looked at the two young women with na touched curiosity; and
Joseph Sedley heaved somethiug very like a sigh out of his big chest, as he
cast his eyes dowu towards his favourite Hessian boots.
Let us have some music, Miss Sedley-Amelia,'' sanil George, who
felt at that moment an cxtraordinary, almost irresistible impulse to seize
the above-mentioned yonng woman in his arms, and to kiss hcr in thoe fuee
of the compay; aud she lookel at him for a moment, and if I should say
that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of tine, I should
perhaps be telling an untruth, for the fact is, that these two young people
had been bred up by their parcnts for this very purose, and thcir banns
had, as it were, bhcen read in their respective fnmilies any time these ten
years. They went off to the piano, wlich was situated, as pianos usually
are, in tlhe baeck drawing-room; and as it wns rather lark, Miss Mmelia, in
the most unaffected way in the world, put her hand into Mr. Osborne's,
who, of course, could see the way among the chirs and ottomans a great
denl better than she could. But this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley
teite-d-tete ith Rebecea, at the drawiug-room table, where tle lutter was
oceupied in netting a green silk purse.
 Tuere is no need to ask family sccrets,'' said Miss Sharp.  Those
two have told theirs,''
As soon as he gets his company,'' said Joseph, ``I belicve the affuair is
zettled. George Osborne is ns good a fellow as ever breathel.''
``And your sister te dearest crenture in the world,'' said Rebeccn.
`Happy the man who wins herl' With this, Miss Slarp gue a great
sigh.
When two unmarriel persons get togcther, und talk upon such delicnte
subjects as the present, a great deal of confidenee and intimacy is presently
established between them. here is no need of giving a spccial report of
the conversation which now took place between Mr. Sclcy and the young
lady; for the conversation, as mny bce judged from the foregoing specimen,
was not especially witty or cloqnent; it seldom is in private societies, or
anywhere except in very high-flown and ingenious novels. As there was
music in the next room, the talk was carricd on, of course, in a low and
becoming tone, though, for the matter of that, the couple in the next apnrt-
ment would not have been disturbed had the talking been ever so loud, so
occupied were thcey with their own pursuits.
lmost for the first time in lis life, Mr. Selley found himself talking,
without the least timidity or hesitation, to n pcrson of the other sex. MIiss

YANIIY FAIRB.
Ielccca asked lim a great number of questions about India, whicl gave
him an opportunity of narrating many interesting aneedotes about that
country aud himself. HIe described the balls at Government House, nd
the manner in whivh they kept themscelves cool in the lot weathcr, witl
punkahs, tattics, and other contrivances; and he was very witty regarding
the number of Scotchen whom Lord Minto, the Govcrnor-General,
patronised; and then he described a tiger hunt ; and the manner in whieh
the mahout of his cleplant had been pulled off his seat by one of thc
infuriated animals. IIow delightel Miss ebeccn was at the Government
balls, and how she laughed at the stories of the fScotch aides-de-camp, and
called Mr. Sedley a sad wicked satiricnl crcature; and how frightened shc
wns at the story of the elcphant. For your mother's sake, dear Mr.
Sedley,'' she said, ` for the suke of all your friends, promise neeer to go on
one of those horrid ecxpeditions,''
 Pooh, pool, Miss Sharp,'' said he, pulling up his shirt-collars; `` thc
danger makes the sport only the pleasanter.'' He had never been but onee
at a tiger-hunt, when the accident in qucstion occurred, and when he was
half killed-not by tle tiger, but by the friglt. Aud as he talked on, le
grew quite bol, and actually had tle audcity to ask Miss Rebecca for
whom she was knitting the green silk purse? He was quite surpriscd and
lelighted at his own graceful familiar manuer.
For any one who wants a purse,'' replied Miss Rebeccn, looking at
him in the most gentle winning way. Sedley was going to make one of
tle most eloquent speechcs possible, and hal begun, `O Miss Sharp,
how-'' when soe song which was performed in the other room came to
an end, and causcd him to hear his own voice so distinctly that he stopped,
blushed, and blew his nose in great agitation.
Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence P'' whispered
Mr. Osborne to Amelia. : Why, your friend has worked miracles.''
 The more the better,'' snid Miss Amclin; who, like almost all women
who are worth a pin, was a match-maker in her heart, and would have been
delighted that Joseph should cnrry back a wife to India. She had, too, in
thc course of this few days' constant intercourse, warmed into a most
tender friendship for Rebecca, nnd discovered a million of virtues and
amiable qualities in her which sle had not perceived when they wero at
Chiswick together. or the affection of young ladies is of as rapid growth
as Jack's bean-stalk, and reaches up to the sky ina night. It is no blame
to them that after mnrriage this Sehxueuelt nach der Liele subsides. It is
what sentientalists, who dcal in eery big words, cull a yenrning after th
Ideal, and simply mcans that women are commonly not satisfied until they
have husbands and children on whom they may centre affections, which
are spent elsewhere, as it were, in small change.
Having expended her little store of songs, or having stayed long enough
in the bnck drawing-room, it now appeared proper to Miss Amelia to ask
her friend to sing. ` You would not have listened to me,'' she said to
Mr. Osborne, (though she knew she was teling a fib,) ``had you heard
ebecca first,''
I gic Miss Sharp warning, though,'' snid Osborne, `' that, right or
wrong, I consiler Mliss Mmelia Sedley the first singer in the worl.''

You shuall her,'' sid Amelia; md Joseph Sedley was actully polite
enough to csrry the candles to the piano. Osborne hinted that he should
like quite ns well to sit in the dark; but Miss Sedley, laughing, decliued
to bear him company any farther, and the two accordingly followel Mr.
Joseph. Rebeecas sng far better than her friend, (though of coursc
Osborne was free to keep his opinion,) and exerted herself to the utmost,
nnd, indeed, to the wonder of Amelia, who had never known her perform
so well. She sang a French song, which Joseph did not understand in thc
lcast, and which George confessed he did not understand, and then a
number of those simple ballads which were the fashion forty years ago,
nnd in which British tars, our King, poor usan, blue-eyed Mary, and thc
like, were the principal themes. They are not, it is said, very brilliant, ius
a mnsical point of view, but contain numberless good-natured, siple
ppeals to the affcetions, which people understood better than the ilk-
and-water lagrime, sospiri, and felicit of the etemnal Donizettian music
with which we nre faoured no-n-days.
Conversation of a scntimental sort, befitting the subjcct, was carricd on

East India Company's service, was actually seated tte-a-tte with a young
lndy, looking at her with a most killing expression; his arms stretched
out before her in an imploring attitude, and his hands bound in a web of
green silk, which she was unwinding.
In this romantic position Osborne and hAmclia Iod the intcresting

ns it seemed, the dullest of all Dr.
Swishtail's young gentlemen. His
A parent was a grocer in the city : nd
it was bruited abroad that he was ad-
mitted into Dr. Swishtail's academy
upon what are called `mutual prin-
ciples'- that is to say, the expenses of his boarl and schooling were
defrayed by his father, in goods not moncy; and hc stood there-almost
at the bottom of the school-in lis scraggy corluroys and jacket, through
the seams of which his great big bones were bursting-ns the representative
of so many pounds of ten, candles, sugar, mottlel-soup, plums, (of which a
very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the cstablishment), and
other commodities. A dreadful dy it was for young Dobbin when one of
the youngsters of thce school, having run into the the towupon a poaching
excursion for hardbake and polonies, cspicl the cart of Dobbin & Rudge,
Grocers and Oilmen, Thames Street, London, at the octor's door, dis-
charging a cargo of the wares in which thc firm dealt.
oung Dobbin had no peace ater that. he jokes were frightful, and
merciless aguainst him. `` IIullo, Dobbin,'' onc wag would say, ``here's
god news in the paper. Sugars is ris', y boy.'' Another would set
a sum-'`If a poud of mutton-candles cost sevenpence-halfpenny, how
much must Dobbin cost?'' and a roar would follow fro all the circle of
young kaves, usher and all, wlo rightly considerel that the selling of goods
by retail is a shameful and infamous practice, meriting the contempt and
scorn of all real gentlemen.
``Your father's only a mcerchant, Osborne,'' Dobbin said in priate to
the little boy who had brought down the stormn upon him. At which
the ntter replied haughtily, ` My father's a gentlean, and keeps his
carriage;'' and Mr. William Dobbin retrented to an remote outhouse in
the play-ground, where he passed a half-holiday in the bitterest sudness
and o. Who amongst us is there that does not recollcet similar hours of

bitter, bitter childish griefP Who feels injustice; who shrinks before a
slight; who has as sense of wrong so acute, and so glowing a gratitude
for kindness, as a generous boy? and how many of those gentle souls do
you degrade, estrange, torture, for the sake of a little loose arithmetic, and
miserable dog-latinf
Now, William Dobbin, from an ineapacity to acquire the rudiments of
the above language, as they are propounded in that wonderful book the
Eton Latin Grammar, wuas copelled to remain among the very last of
Doctor Swishtail's scholars, anl was `taken down' continually by little
fellows with pink faces and pinafores when he marched up with the lower
form, a giant amongst them, with his dowucast, stupefiedlook, his dogs-eared
primer, and his tight corduroys. lIigh and low, all made fun of him.
Tley sewed up those corduroys, tight as they were. They cut his bed-
strings. They upset buckets and benches, so that he might break his
shins over them, which he never failed to do. Tley sent him parcels,
which, when opened, were found to contain the paternal soap and candles.
There was no little fellow but had his jcer and joke at Dobbin; and he
bore everything quite patiently, and was entirely dumb and iserable.
Cuff, on the contrary, was the great chief and dandy of the Swishtail
Seminary. He smuggled wine in. He fought the town-boys. Ponies
used to come for him to ride home on Saturdays. He had his top-boots
in his room, in which he used to hunt in the holidays. He had a gold
repeater : and took nuff like the Doctor. He huad been to the Opera,
and knew the merits of the principal actors, preferring Mr. Kenn to Mr.
kemble. He could knoek you off forty Latin verses in an hour. He eould
make French poetry. What else didn't he know, or couldn't he doP They
said evsen the Doctor himself was afraid of him.
Cuff, tle unquestioned king of the school, ruled over his subjects, and
bulliel them, with splendid superiority. This one blacked his shoes: that
toasted his bread, others would fag out, and give him alls at aricket
during whole summer afternoons. ` Figs' was the fellow whom he despised
most, and with whom, though always abusing him, and sneering at him,
he scnrcely ever condescended to hold personal communiceation.
One day in priate, the two young gentlemen had had a difference. Figs,
alone in the school-room, was blundering over a home lctter; when Cuff,
entering, bade him go upon some message, of which tarts were probably
the subject.
 I cn't,'' says Dohbin; ``I want to finish my letter.''
 You caw't 2'' says Mr, Cuff, laying hold of that doeument, (in which
many words were scratched out, many werc mis-spelt, on which had heen
spent I don't know how much thought, and lahour, nnd tears; for the poor
faellow was writing to his mother, who was fond of him, although she was
a grocer's wife, and lired in a back parlor in hames-street), `` lou can't2'
says Mr. Cuf:  ` I should like to know why, pray Cnn't you write to
old MIother Figs to-morrow %''
Don't call names,'' Dobbin said, getting off the bench, very nerous.
Well, sir, will you go2'' crowed the cock of the school.
e Put down thec letter,'' Dbbin replicd; ``no gentleman readth letterth.''
 Well, now will you go'' says the other.
A NOYEL WIIROUT 1 HERO.
No, I won't. Don't strike, or Ill lasl you,'' roars out Dobbin,
springing to s leeden inkstand, and looking so wicked, thet Mr. Cuf
paused, turned down his coat sleeres again, put his hands into his pockets,
aund walked away with a sneer. But he never meddled personally wirith the
groeer's boy after that: though we mst do him the justice to say he alwss
spoke of Mr. Dobhin with contempt behind his back.
ome time after this interview, it happened that Mr. Cuff, on a sun-
shiny afternoon, wes in the neighbourhood of poor William Dobbin, who
was lying under a tree in the play-ground, spelling over a fuavourite copy
of the Arabian Nights whieh he had-apart from the rest of the school,

If people wonld but leave children to themselves; if teachers would
cease to bully them; if parents would not insist upon directing their

Well, William Dobbin had for onee forgotten the world, and wss away
with Sindbad the Sailor in the Valley of Diamonds, or with Prince What-
yecallem and tle Fairy Peribanou in that delightful cavern where the
Prince found her, and whither we should all like to make a tour; when
slrill crics, as of a little fellow weeping, woke up his pleasunt reverie;
and, looking up, he saw Cuff before lim, belahouring a little boy.
It was the lad who had peached upon lim about the grocer's cart; but
he bore little malice, not ut least towards the young and small.  How
dare you, sir, break the bottle2'' says Cuff to the little urchin, swinging
a yellow cricket-stump over him.
The boy had been instructed to get over the play-ground wall (at n
selected spot where the broken-glass had been removed from the top, and
niches mate counvenient in the brick); to run a quartcr of a mile; to purchase
n pinut of rum-shub on credit; to brave nll the Doetor's outlying spies,
and to clamber back into the play-ground again; during the performance
of which feat, his foot had slipt, and the bottle was broken, and the shrub
had been spilt, nnd his pantaloons had been damaged, and he appeared
beftore his employer a perfeetly guilty and trembling, though harmlees,
wretch.
How dnre you, sir, break it'' says Cuff; `' you blundering little thief.
You drank the shrub, and now you pretend to have broken the bottle.
1Iold out your hand, sir.''
Down came the stump with a great heavy thump on the clill's hnnd.
A onn followel. Dobbin looked up. Tho Princo Peribanou had fled
into the inmost cavern with Prince Ahmed: the Roc hnd whisked nway
Sindbad the Sailor out of the Valley of Diamonds out of sight, far into the
clouds: and there was every-day life before honest William; and a big boy
beating a little one without cuse.
 Hold out your other hand, sir,'' ronrs Cuf to his little school-fellow,
whose face was distorted with ain. Dobbin quivered, and gathered him-
self up in his narrow old clotes.

I cnn't tell what his motive wns. Torture in a public school is as much
licensed as the knout in Russia. It woull be ungentlemanlike (ina
manner) to resist it. Perhaps Dobbin's foolish soul resolted against that
exercise of tyranny; or perhaps he had a hankering feeling of revenge in
is mind, and longel to measure himself agninst that splendid bully and
tyrant, who had all the glory, pride, pomp, circumstance, banners flying,
drums beating, guards saluting, in the place. WWhatever may have been
his incentive, however, up he sprang, and screamed out, ``IIold off, Cuff;
don't bully that child any more; or I'll-''

ee I 'll give you the worst thrashing you ever hal in your life,'' Dobbin
said, in reply to the first part of Cuff's sentenee; nnd little Osborne,
gnsping and in tears, looked up with wonder and ineredulity nt seeing this
nmazing champion put up suddenly to defend him : while Cuff's nstonish-
ment was scarcely less. Fancy our late monareh George III, when ho
heard of the revolt of the North American colonies: fancy brzen Goliah
when little David stepped forwnrd and claimed a meeting; nnd you have
the feelings of Mr. Reginald Cuff when this rencontre was proposed to him.

to say, `Make your will, and communicnte your best wishes to your friends

'As you please,'' Dobbin said.  You must bo my bottle-holder,
Osborne.''
Well, if you like,'' little Osborne repliel; for you sce his ppa ket n
carriage, and he wns rather aslmed of his champion.
Yes, when the hour of battle came, he was almost ashamed to sny,'' Go
it, Figs ;'' and not a single other boy in the place uttered that cry for the
first two or three rounds of this famous combat; ut the commeneement of
which the cientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on his fiuce, and as
light and as gay ns if he was at a ball, plantel his blows upon his adver-

n thrasling, Figs, nnd you knuw I'm usel to it.'' But Figs, nll whose
limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage, ptut his
little bottle-holler aside, and went in for a fourth time.
As he did not in the least know how to parry thc blows that were aimed at
himself, and Cuff lad bcgun the attack on the thrce preceding oeecsions,
without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now determined that he
would commence the engagement by a charge on his ow part; and accord-
ingly, being a lef-handed man, brought that arm into action, and hit out
na couple of times with ull his might-once at Mr. Cuff's left eye, anl once
on his beautiful Romnn nose.
Cnff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly.  W1

went down every time. At the sixth rount, therc were ulmost as many
fellows shouting out, `` Go it, Figs,'' ns there were youths exeluiming, '' Go
it, Cu.'' At the twelth round the latter champion was all abronl, ns the
saying is, and had lost all presenee of mind and power of attaek or lefence.
Figs, on the contrary, was as calm as a quaker. His fuce being quite pale,
his eyes shining open, and a great cut on his under lip bleeding profusely,
gave this young fellow a fierce nnd ghastly air, which perhaps struck terror
into many spectatora. Nevertheless, his intrepid adversanry prepared tu
close for the thirteenth time.

YAITY AIR.
I I hal the pen of a Napier, or n.Bell's Life, I should like to describe
this combt properly. It was the lst charge of the Guard-(that is, it
ould have bcen, only Waterloo had not yet taken plaece)-it was Ney's
column breasting the lill of ILn Haye Suainte, bristling with ten thousand
bayonets, and crowned with twenty cagles-it was the shout of the beef-
enting British, as leaping down the hill they rushed to hug the cnemy in
the savage arms of battle-in other words, Cuff coming up full of pluck,
but quite reeling and groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on
his adersary's nose, and sent him down for the last timc.
I think tlat will do for him,'' Figs sail, as his opponent dropped as
neatly on the green as I have seen Jack Spot's ball plump into the pocket
at billiards; an the fnact is, when time was clled, Mr. eginald Cuff was
not able, or did not choose, to stand up agin.
And now all the boys set up such a shont for Figs as would make you
think he had been thcir duarling champion through the whole battle; and
as absolutcly brought Dr. Swishtail out of his study, curious to know the
cnuse of the uproar. He tlreatened to flog Figs violently, of course;
but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing his
wounds, stood up and said, `` It's my fault, sir-not Figs'-not Dobbin's.
I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.'' By which magna-
imous spcech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping, but got back
ll lis ascendancy orer the boys which his defeat had nearly cost him.
Ioung Osborne wrote home to his parents an account of the transactian.

In eonsequence of Dobbin's victory, his character roe prodigiously in
the estimation of all his schoolfellows, and the name of Figs which had
been a byword of repronch became as respectable and popular a nickame
as any other in use in the school. ``After all, it's not his fault that his
father 's a grocer,'' George Osborne sid, who, though a little chap, had a
very high popularity among the Swishtail youth; and his opinion was
received with grcnat npplause. It was voted low to sneer at Dolbin about

endearment; and the sneak of an usher jeered at him no longer.
And Dobbin's spirit rose with his altered circumslances. e male
wonderful advances in scholastie learuing. The superb Cuff himself, nt
whose condeseension Dobbin could only blush and wonder, helped him on
with his Latin verses; ``coached'' him in play-hours; crried him trium-
phantly out of the little-boy class into the midlle-sized form; and even
there got a fair place for lim. It was discovered, that although lull at
classical learning, at mathematics he was uneommonly quick. To the
contentment of all, he passcd thirl in algebra, and got a French prize-book
at the public midsummer examination. on should huve seen his molher's
face when Telemaque (that delicious romance) was presented to him by the
Doctor in tho fuce of the whole school and the parents and company, with an
inscription to Gulielmo Dobbin. All the boys clapped hands in token
of applause and sympathy. IIis blushcs, his stumbles, his awkwardness,
and the number of fet which he orushed as he went back to his place,
who slall describe or culculate?' Old Dobbin, his father, who no
respeected him for the first time, gave him two guineas publicly; most of
which he spent in a general tuck-out for the school: and le came back in
a tail-coat after the holidays.
Dobbin was much too modest a young fellow to suppose that this
happy change in all his circumstances arose from his own generous and
manly disposition: he chose, rom some perverseness, to attribute his good
fortune to the sole agency and benevoleuce of little George Osborne, to
whom heneeforth he vowed such a love and affection ns is only felt by
children-such n affection, ns we read in the charming fairy-book,
uncouth Orson had for splendid young Valentine his conqueror. He
flung himself lown at little Osborne's fect, and loved him. Even
before they were acquainted, he had admired Osborne in secret. Now he
was his valet, his dog, his man Fridny. He belieed Osborne to be the
possessor of every perfection, to be the handsomest, the bravest, the most
active, the cleverest, the most generous of created boys. He sharel his
money with him: bought him uncountable presents of knives, pencil-cases,
gold seuls, toffee, Little Warblcrs, and romantic books, with large coloured
pictures of knights and robbers, in many of which latter you might read
inscriptions to George Bedley Osborne, Esquire, from his attaehed friend
WWilliam Dobbin-the which tokens of homage George received very
graciously, as became his superior merit.
So that when Lieutenant Osbormne, coming to Russell quare on the
lay of the Vauxhall party, said to the lasdies, ``Mrs. Sedley, Ma'am, I
hope you have room ; I 've asked Dobbhin of ours to come and dine here,
und go with us to Vauxhall. He's almost as modcst as Jos.''
``Modestyl pooh,'' said the stout gentleman, casting a asiqewr look
at Miss harp.
:He is-but you are incomparably more graceful, Beley,'' Osborne
added, langhing. 'I met him at the Bedford, when I went to look for
you; and I told him that Miss Amelia was come home, and that we wera
all bent on going out for a niglht's pleasuring; and that Mrs. Sedley had

Mrs. Sedley suid: at which speech Miss Amclia only male a smile and a
blusl; and looking at Mr. George Oslorne's pale interesting countenance,
and those beautiful black, curling, shining whiskers, which the young
gentlcman himself regrded with no ordinary complaeency, she tlought in
her little hert, that in His Mjesty's army, or in the wide world, there
never was such a face or such a hero. I don't care about Cnptain
Dobbin's complexion,'' she said, ``or about his awkwarudness. I shall
always like him, I know;'' her little reason being, that he was the frienl
and champion of George.
 There 's not a finer fellow in the service,'' Osborne said, ``nor n bet-
ter officer, though he is not an Adonis, certainly.'' And he looked towards
the glass himself with much naicete',: and in so doing, caught Miss Shiarp's
eye fixed keenly upon him, at which he blushed a little, and Relecca

That evening, when Amclia came tripping into the drawing-room in a
wlite muslin frock, prepored for conquest at Vauxhall, singing like n

hands and feet, and large ears, set off by a closely cropped head of blnck

His history since he left sehool, until the very moment when we have
the pleasure of meeting him again, although not fully narrated, has yet, I
think, been indicated sufficiently for nn ingenious reader by the conversa-
tion in the last page. Dobbin, the despised groeer, was Alderman Dobbin-
Alderman Dobbin was Colonel of the City Light Horse, then burning with
military ardour to resist the French Invasion. Colonel Dobbin's corps,
in which old Mr. Osbomne limself was but an inlifferent corporal, had
been reviewed by the Sovereign and the Duke of ork; and the colonel
and alderman had been knighted. His son had entered the army: nnd
young Osborne followel presently in the same regiment. They had served
in the West Indies and in Canada. Their regiment had just come lome,
and the attachment of Dohbin to George Osborne was as warm and
generous now, as it had been, when the two were schoolboys.
So these worthy people sat down to dinner presently. They talked
about war and glory, nnd Boney and Lord Wllington, and the last

to gallant young men longed to see their own names in the glorious list,
and cursed their nnlucky fate to belong to a regiment which had been away
from the chances of honour: Mias Sharp kindled with this exciting talk,
but Miss Sedley trembled and grew quite faint as she heard it. Mr. Jos
told several of his tiger-hunting stories, finished the one about Miss Cut-
ler and Lance the surgeon: helped Rebecca to everything on the table,
nnd himself gobbled and drank a great deal.
He sprang to open the door for the ladies, when they retired, with the
most killing grace-and coming back to the table, filled himself bumper
after bumper of claret, which he swallowed with nerous rapidity.
He's priming himself,'' Osborne whispered to Dobbin, and at length
the hour and the carriage arrived for Vauxhall.

Thus you see, ladies, low this story might have been written, if the
author had but a mind; for, to tell the truth, he is just as familiar with
Newgate as with the palaces of our revered aristocracy, and has seen the
outside of both. But as I don't understand the language or manners of
the ookery, nor that polyglot conversation which, according to the fushion-
able novelists, is spoken by the leaders of ton; we must, if you please,
preserve our middle course modestly, amidst those scenes and personages

with which we are most familiar. In a word, this chapter about Vanxhall
would have been so exceeding short but for the above little disquisition, that
it scarcely would have deserved to be called a chapter at all. And yet it is
an chapter, and a very important one too. Are not there little chapters in
everybody's life, that seem to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the
listory ?
Let us then step into the coach with the RBussell-square party, and be
off to the Gardens. There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp,
who are on the front sent. Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite, betwcen
Captain Dobbin and Amelia.
Lvery soul in the coach agreed, that on that night, Jos would.propose to
make Rebecca Slarp Mrs. Sedley. The parents at home had acquiesced
in the arrangeent, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a feeling
very much akin to contempt for his son. He ssid he was vain, selfish,
lazy, and effeminate. He conld not endure his airs as a man of fashion,
anl laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories. `'I shall leave
the fellow lalf my property,'' he said; ``and he will have, besides, plenty
of his own; but as I am perfectly sure that if you, and I, and his sister
were to ie to-morrow he would say `Good Gall' and eat his dinner just
as well as usual, I am not going to make myself anxious ahout him. Let
im mrry whom he likes. It's no affair of mine.''
Amelia, on the other hand, as became a young woman of her prudence
and temperament, was quite enthusiastic for the match. Once or twice.
Jos had been on the poiut of saying something very important to her, to
which she was nost willing to lend an ear, but the fat fellow could not be
brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his
sister's disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned
away.
This mystery served to keep Amclia's gentle bosom in a perpetual flutter
of excitement. If she did not speak with Rebecca on the tender subject,
she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations with Mrs.
Blenkinsop, tle housekeeper, who dropped some hints to the lady's-maid,
who may hae cursorily mentioned it to the cook, who curried the news, I
have no doubt, to all the tradesmen, so that Mr. Jos's marriage was now
talked off by a very considerable number of persons in the Russell-square
world.
It was, of course, Mrs. Selley's opinion that her son would demean
himself by a marriage with an artist's daughter. But, lor', Mn'am,''
cjaculated Mrs, Blenkinsop, `` we was only grocers when we marriedMIr.
., who was a stock-broker's clerk, and we hadn't fie hundred pounds
among us, and we're rich enough now,'' And Amelia was entirely of tlis
opinion, to which, gralually, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley was brought.
Mr. Selley was neutral. ``Let Jos marry whom he likes,'' he said;
it's no affair of mine. This girl has no iortune; no more hal Mrs.
Sedley. She seems good-humoured and clever, and will keep him in order,
perhaps. Better she, y dear, than a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of
mahogany grandchildren.''
So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebeecea's fortunes. She took
Jos's arm, as a matter of ocourse, on going to dinner; she had sate by him

on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous `buek'' he was, as
he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though nobody snida
word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to understand it.
All she wanted was the proposal, and nhl how Rebecca now felt the
want of a mother l-a dear tender mother, who would have mannged the
business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little delicate confidential
conversation, would have extracted the interesting avowal from the bash-
ful lips of the young mnl
Such was the state of affairs as the cariage crossel Westminster-bridge.
The party was landed at the Royal Gardens in due time. As the
majestie Jos stepped out of the erenking vehicle the erowd gave a cheer
for the fat gentleman, who blushed and looked very big and mighty, as he
walked awasy with Rebecca under his arm. George, of course, took charge
of Mmelia. She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.
I say, Dohbin,'' says George, ``just look to the shnwls and things,
there 's a good fellow,'' And so while he paired off wth Miss Sedley, and
Jos squeezed through the gate into tle Gardens with Rebeccn at his side,
honest Dobbin contented himself by giving an arm to the shawls, and by
pwying at the door for the whole party.
He walked very modestly behinl them. He wns not willing to spoil
sport. About Rebecca and Jos he did not cnre a fig. But he thought
 Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Osborne, and as he saw that
good-looking couple, threading thc walks to the girl's delight nnd wonder,
he watched her artless happiness with a sort of futherly pleasure. Perhaps
he felt that he would have liked to have something on his own arm besidese
na shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky young officer cnrrying this
female burthen); but Willium Dobbin was very little addicted to selfish
cnleulation at all; and so long as his friend was enjoying himself, how
should he be discontented And the truth is, that of all the lelights of the
Gardens ; of the hundred thonsand extra lamps, which were always lighted;
the fiddlers, in coeked hats, who playel ravishing melodics under tle gilded
cockle-shell in the midst of the gardens; the singers, both of comic and
sentimental ballads, who charmed the ears there; the country dances,
formed by bouncing coekneys and cockneyesses, and executed amidst jump-
ing, thumping, and laughter; the signal which announccd that Madame
Saqui was about to mount skyward on a slack-rope ascending to the stars;
the hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage; thc dark walks,
so favourable to the interviews of young lovers; the pots of stout handed
abont by the people in the shabby old liverics; and the twinkling boxes,
in whieh the happy feasters made-believe to eat slices of almost invisible
ham ;-of all these things, and of the gentle Simpson, that kind smiling
idiot, who, I daresay, presidel even then over the plaece-Cnptain William
oblin did not take the slightest notice.
He cnrried abont Amelia's white cnshmere shawl, and hnving attended
nnder the gilt cockle shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of
Borodino, (a savage Cantata agninst the Corsican pstart, who had lately
met with his Russian reverses)-Mr. Dobbin tried to hum it as he walked
nway, and fond he was humming-the tune which Amclia Sedley sang

He burst out laugling at himself; for the truth is, he could sing no
better than an owl.
It is to be understood, as a matter of course, that our young people,
being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn promises to keep
together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards.
Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'twas only to meet again at
supper-time, wlen they could talk of their mutual adventures in the
interval.
What were the adventures of Mr. Osborne and Miss Amelia That is
a secret. But be sure of tlis-they were perfectly happy, and correct in
their behaviour ; and as they had been in the habit of being together any-
time these fifteen years, their teite-a-tdite offered no particular novelty.
But when Miss Rebececa Sharp and her stout companion lost themselves

in a solitary walk, in which there were not ahove five score more of couples
similarly straying, they both felt that the situation was extremely tender
and critical, and now or never was thc moment, Miss Sharp thought, to
provoke thast declaration which was trembling on the timid lips of Mr.
Sedley. They had previously been to the panorama of Moseow, where a
rude fellow, treading on Miss Sharp's foot, cused her to fall back with a
little shriek into the arms of Mr, Sedley, and this little incident inereased

the tenderness and confidence of that gentleman to such a degree, that he
told her several of lis favourite Indian stories over aguin for, at least,
the sixth time.
 How I should like to see India1'' said Hcbecca.
 SIould you '' said Joseph, with a most killing tenderuess; anl wns
no doubt about to follow up this artful interrogatory by a question still
more tender (for he puffed nnd panted a great denl, and ebece's hnnd,
which was placed nenr his heart, could count the feverish pulsations of
that organ), when, oh, provokingl tle bell rang for the fireworks, and,
a great scuffling and running taking place, these interesting loers werc
obliged to follow in the stream of people.
Cantain Dobbin had some thoughts of joining the party at suppes: as,
in truth, he found the Yauxhall asemeut not particularly livcly-but he
paraded twice before the box where the now united couples were met, nand
nobody took any notice of him. Covers were laid for four. The mnated
pairs were prattling away quite happily, and Dobbin knew he was as cleun
forgotten as if he hnd never existed in this world.
 I should only be de trop,'' said the Cnptain, looking at them rather
wistfully.  I'd best go and talk to the hermit,''-nnd so he strolled off
out of the hum of men, nnd noise, and cluatter of the banquet, into the
dark walk, at the end of which lived that well-known pastebonrd Solitary.
It wasmn't very good fun for Dobbin-and, indeel, to be alone at Vauxhall,
I have found, from my own experience, to be one of the most dismal
sports ever entered into by a bachelor.
The two couples were pcrfectly happy thecn in their box: where thc
most delightful and intimate conversation took place. Jos was in his
glory, ordering about the waiters with great majesty. He mnde the salad;
annd uncorked the Chnmpagne; and carved the chickens; and ate and
drank the greater part of the refreshments on the tablcs. Finally, he
insisted upon haing a bowl of rack punch; everyboly had rack puneh at
Vauxhall.  Waiter, rack puneh.''
That bowl of rack punch was the cause of all this history. And why
not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other causeP Was not a bow1 of
prussic acid the cause of fair Rosamond's retiring from the world? Wna
not a bowl of wine the cause of the demise of Alexander the Grent, or at
least, does not Dr,. Lempricre say so -so did this bowl of rnck punch
influence the fates of all the principal characters in thiis ` Novel without a
Hero,'' which we are now relating. It influeneed their life, although most
of them did not taste a drop of it.
The young ladies did not drink it; Osborne did not like it; and tho
consequcnce was that Jos, that fat gourmand, drank up the whole con-
tents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking up the whole
contcnts of the bowl was, a liveliness which at first was astonishing, and
then became almost painfnl; for he talked and laughed so loud as to
bring scores of listeners round the box, much to the confusion of the
innocent party within it; and, volunteering to sing a song (which he did
in that maudlin high-key peculiar to gentlemen in an inebriated state), he
almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the musicians

applause.
'Brsyo, Fat unl'' said one; ' Angeore, Daniel Lambert I1'' sid
another;  What a figre for the tight-rope l'' exclaimed another wag, to
the inexpressible alarm of the ladies, and the great anger of Mr. Osborne.
e For Heaen's sake, Jos, let us get up and go,'' cried that gentleman,
and the young women rose.
 Stop, my dearest didlle-didle-larliug,'' shouted Jos, now as bold as
a lion, and clasping Miss Rebecca round the waist. Rebecca started, but
she could not get away her hand. The laughter outside redoubled. Jos
continued to drink, to ake love, and to sing; and, winking and waving
his glass gracefully to his audience, challenged all or any to come in aud
tike a sliare of his pimch.
Mr. Osborne as justton the point of knoeking down a gentleman in
top-boots, who propgdfo take adiantge of tlis invitation, and a com-
motion semed to l initable, whn by the greatest good luck a gentlc-
man of the nameaf Bohpin, who had ben walking about the garlens,

wnas closed upon them, and as he walked aeross ussell-square, laughed so
as to astonish the watchman. Amelia looked very ruefully at her friend,
as they went up-stairs, and kissed her, and went to bed without any more

keep his countenance in order, as he looked at his unfortunate master.

confidence to Osbornc, as the latter mounted the stair.  He wanted to

and anounced  MIr. Hosbin.''

For thrasling him lsst night-didn't he, Dobin? You hit out, sir,
like Molyncux. The watclunan says he never saw a fellow go down so
struight. Ask Dobbin.''
You did have a ronnl with thc coachman,'' Cnptain Dobbin sail, ``nnd
showed plenty of fight too,''
`And that fellow with the white conat at Vnuslall. How Jos drove at
him. IIow the women sereamedl By Jove, sir, it did y heart good to
see you. I thought you civilians had no pluck; but I 'll never get in your

I believe I 'm very terrible, when I 'm rousel,'' ejaeulated Jos from tle
sofa, nnd made a grimaee so dreary and ludicrous, that the Captain's
politeness could restrain him no longer, and he and Osborne firel offna
ringing volley of laughter.
Osborne pursued his advantage pitilessly. Hc. thought Jos a milksop.

Jos and Rebecca, nnd was not over-well pleased that a member of a family

you couldn't astand-you made cvseryboly laugh in the Gardens, though
you were crying yourself. You were maudlin, Jos. Don't you remember

ruthless young fellow, seizing hold of Dolbin's hand, actcd over the scene,
to the lorror of the original performer, and in spite of Dobbin's good-
natured entrenties to him to have mercy.
Why should I spare him P'' Oaborne said to his friend's remonstrances,
when they quittel the invalid, leaving him under the hands of Doctor
Gollop.  What the deuce right has he to give hiself his ptronizing

is ogling and making love to him? Hung it, the family 's low enough
already, without her. A goerness is all very well, but I'd rather have a
lady for my sister-in-law. I 'm a liberal man; but I've proper pride, nnd
know my own station: let her know hers. And I'll take down that
great hectoring Nabob, and prevent him from being ade a greater fool
than he is. That's why I told him to look out, lest she brought an aetion

As he walked down Southanpton Row, from Holborn, he laughed as

he saw, at the Seley Mansion, in two ilifferent stories, two heads on tho
look-out.
The fact is, Miss Amelia, in the lrawing-room baleony, was looking
very eagerly towards the opposite sile of the Square, where Mr. Osborne
dwelt, on the watech for the lieutenant hiself; and Miss Shrp, from her
little bed-room on the second-loor, was in observation until Mr. Joseph's
great form should lcae in sight.
 Sister hnne is on the watch-tower,'' snid he to Amelia, '` but there's
nobody coming;'' andlaughing and ejoying the joke hugely, he lescribed
in the most ludicrous terms to Miss tSedley, the dismal condition of her
brother.
 I think it 's very cruel of you to laugh, George,'' she snil, looking
pnrticularly unhappy; but Gcorge only laughed thc more at her piteous
and discomfited men, persisted in thinking the joke a ost diverting one,
nnd when Miss Sharp came dow stairs, bantered her with a great deal of
livelincss upon the effecet of her chars on thc fat civilian.
O Miss Sharpl if you coull but see him tlis morning,'' he said-
` moning in his flowered dressing-gow-writhing on his sofa; if you
could but have seen him lolling out his tongue to (iollop the npothecury.''
See whom %'' anid Miss Slarp.
 WhomP O whom? Cnptain Dobbin, of course, to whom we were all
so attentive, by the way, last night.''
We were very unkind to him,'' Emmy snid, bluskinug vcry uch.
I--I quite forgot him.''
Of course you did,'' criel Osborne, still on the laugh. One can't
be alveays thinking about Dobbin, you know, Amelin. Cau one, Miss
Sharp2''
` Except wlen he overset the glass of wine at dimner,'' Miss Sharp snil,
with a haughty air and n toss of the head, ` I never gave the existence of
Cnptain Dobbin one single moment's consideration.''
 Very good, Miss Shurp, I'll tell him,'' Osbornc sail; nnd as he spoke
Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust nnd hatred towards this
young officer, whicl he was quite unconscious of having iuspired.  Ie
is to make fun of me, is he : ' thought ebeee. 1Is he lieen lughing
about me to Joseph Ias he frightened him? Perhaps he won't come.''-
A film passed over her eyes, and hcr heart bcat quite thick.
 You 're always joking,'' said sle, smiling as innocently as she could.
 Joke away, Mr. George; there's nobody to lefcnd me.'' Anl Gcorge
Oshorne, as she walked away-and Amelia looked reprovingly at him-
felt some little manly compunction for hnving inflicted nny unneccssary
nkindness upon this helpless crenture. 'My learest Amelia,'' snid he,
``you are too gool-too kind. ou don't know the world. I do. Aud
your little friend Miss Sharp must learn her station,''
Don't you think Jos will--''
 Upan my worl, my dear, I dlon't know. Ie may, or may not. I'm
not his master. I only know he is a very foolish vin fellow, and put my
ear little girl into  eryr pinfl an rkwrl position last night. Mly
learcst dildle--lidlle-darling?'' He was off lnughing agin; nd he dil
it so drolly tht Emmy lughel too.
YANIF AIR.
All that dsy Jos never came. But Amelia had no fear about this; for
the little schemer had actually sent away the page, Mr. Sambo's aide-de-
camp, to Mr. Joseph's lodgings, to ask for some book he had promised,
and how he vas; and the reply through Jos's man, Mr. Brush, was, that
his master was ill in bed, and had just had the doetor with him. He must
come to-morrow, she thought, but she never had the courage to speak a
word on the subjeet to Rebecca; nor did that young oman herself allude
to it in any way during the whole evening after the night at Yauxhall.
The next dny, however, as the two young ladies sate on the sofa,
pretending to work, or to write letters, or to read novels, Sambo cnme into
the room with his usual engging grin, with a packet under his arm, and
a note on a tray. ` Note from Mr. Jos, Miss,'' says Sambo.

DEAR AMIEILIA,-I send you the Orphan of the Foret. I was too
ill to come yesterday. I lenve town to-day for Cheltenham. Pray excuse
me, if you can, to the nmiable Miss Sharp, for my conduct at Vanxhall,
and entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may hnve uttered when
excited by that futal supper. As soon as I hae recovered, for my health
is very mnch shaken, I shall go to Scotland for some months, and am

It was the death-warrant. All wns over. Amelia did not dare to look
at RBebecca's pale fuece and burning eyes, but she dropt the lctter into her
friend's lap; and got up, and went upstairs to her roo, and ried her
little heart out.
Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, there sought her presently with conso-
lation; on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially, and relievel herself
a good dcal. Don't take on, Mliss.  I didn't like to tellyou. But none
of us in the ouse have likel her except at fust. I sor ler with my own
eyes resding your Mn's letters. Pinner sys she 's always about you
trinket-box anl drawers, and everybody's drawcrs, uand sle's surce she's
put your white ribbing into her box.''
``I gave it her, I gave it her,'' Amelia said.
But this did not alter Mrs. Bleukinsop's opinion of Miss Sharp. I
don't trust them governesses, Pinner, she remarked to the maid. They
give themsclves the hairs and hupstarts of ladies, and their wages is no
better than you nor me.''
It now became clear to eery soul in the house, except poor Amcelia,
that Rebecca should take her departure, and high and low (always with
the one exception) agreed thut thnt event should take place as speedily as
possible. Our good child rnsacked nll her drawers, cupbourds, reticules,
nnd gimcraek boxes-passed in review all her gowns, fichus, tags, bobbins,
laces, silk stockings, and fullals-seleeting tlis thing and that and the other,
to make a little heap for Rebccca. And going to er Papa, that generons
lBritish merchant, who had promised to gise her as iany guineas as shc
was years old-she begged the old gentlemun to give the money to dear
Rebecea, who must wnnt it, wvhile she lacked for nothing.
She even made Gcorge Osborne contribute, and nothing loth (for he was
ns free-handed a young fellow as any in the army), he went to Bond
Street, anl bought the bcst hat and spencer that moncy could buy.
eThat's George's preeeut to you, Rebecca, denar,'' sail Aelia, quite
proud of the bandbox conveying these gifts. e What a taste he hasl
There 's nolody like him.''
Nobody,'' Rcbecca answerel. `How thankful I nm to him.'' She
was thinking in her leart, ` It ws George Osborne who preventcd my
marriage.-And she loved George Osborne accordiugly.
She made her preparations ifor departure with great cquanimity; and
accepted nll the kind little MAmelia's presents, after just the proper degrce
of hesitation and reluctance. She vowed etcrnal gratitude to Mrs. Sedley,
of course; but did not intrude herself upon that good lady too mucl, wlo
was embarrassed, and avilently wishing to avoid ler. She kissel Mr.
Scdlcy's hand, when he prescnted her with the purse; and asked permis-
sion to consider him for the future as her kinl, kind friend and proteetor.
Her behaviour was so affecting that he was going to write her a checque
for twenty pounds more; but he restrnined his feelings: thc cnrriagc was
in wailing to tuke him to dinncr: so he trippcd away with n ` God bless

Finally came tle parting with Miss Amelia, over which picture I intend

MONG the most respected of the
names beginning in C, which the
Court - Guide containel, in the
year 18-, was that of Crawley, Sir
Pitt, Bronet, Great Gnunt Street,
and Gueen's Crawvley, IIants. This
honourable nae had figured con-
stantly also in the 'arliameutary
list for many years, in conjunction
with that of a numbcr of other
worthy gentlemcn who snt in turns
for the borough.
It is related, with regarl to the
borough of Gueen's Crawley, tliat
ucen Elizabeth iu one of her pro-
gresses, stopping at Crawley to
breakfast, was so delighted witl
some remarkably fine Hampshire
. beer which was then presented to
her by the Crawley of the day (
handsome gentleman with a trim beard anl a gool leg), that she forthwitl
erected Crawley into a borough to send two members to Prliament; and
the place, from the day of tlt illustrious visit, took the name of Gucen's
Crawley, which it holds up to the present moment. And though bUy the
lapse of time, and those mutations which ages produce in empires, cities,
nnd boroughs, ueen's Crawley was no longer so populous a place ns it
had been in ueen Bess's time-nay, was come down to that conition of
borough which used to be denominated rotten-yet, ns Sir Pitt Crawley
would say with perfect justice in his elegant way, ``RBottenl be langed-
it produces me a gooil fifteen hundred a year.''
Sir Pitt Crawley (named after the great Commoner), was tle son of
Walpole Crawley, first Baronet, of the Tape nl eling-Wnx Offics
in the reign of George II., when he was impeached for peculation, as
were au great number of other honest gentlemen of those days; and
Walpole Crawley was, as need scarcely be said, son of John Churehill
Crawley, named nfter the celebrated military commander of the rcign of
ueen hnne. The family tree (which langs up at Gucen's Crwley),

furthermore mentions Charles Stuart, aftcrwards called Barebones Craw-
ley, son of the Crawley of James the First's time; and finally, ueen
Elizabeth's Crawley, who is represented as the foreground of the picture
in his forked benrd and armour. Out of his waistcoat, as usual, grows a
tree, on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are in-
scribed. Close by the namc of Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet (the subject
of the present memoir), arc written that of his brother, the Reverend
Bute Crawley (the great Commoner was in disgrace when the reverend
gentlean vas born), reelor of Craleys-cum-nailby, and of sarious
other male and female members of the Crawley family.
Sir Pitt was first marricl to Grizzel, sixth dnughter of Mungo Binkie,
ILord Binkie, and cousin, in consequence of MIr. undas. She brought
him two sons: Pitt, named not so much after his father as after the
heaven-born minister; and Rawdon Crawley, from the Prince of Wales's
friend, wlom his Mjesty Gcorge IY. forgot so completely. Many ycars
after her ldyship's demise, Sir Pitt loel to the altar Rosa, duughter of Mr.
G. Grafton of Mudbury, by whom he had two daughters, for whose
benefit MIiss Rebeccn Sharp was nows engaged as governess. It will be
seen that the young lady was come into n family of very genteel con-
exions, nnd wns about to moe in a much more distinguished circle than
that humble one which she had just quitted in Russell Square.
She had received her orders to join her pupils, in a note which was
written upon an old envclope, and which contained the followiug words:-

John, the groom, who had driven the carriage alone, did not care to
descend to ring the bcll; and so prayed a passing milk-boy to perform
that office for him. When the bell was rung, a head appeared between
the interstices of the dining-room shutters, and the door was openued by a
man in drab breeches and gaiters, with a dirty old coat, a foul old neck-
cloth lsshed round his bristly neck, a shining bald hend, a leering red facc,
a pair of twinkling grey eyes, and a mouth perpetually on the grin.

feller, and Miss will gie you some beer,'' said John, with a horse-lugh,
for he was no longer respectful to Miss Sharp, as her connexion with the
family was broken of, and as she had given nothing to the serantr on
coming away.
The bald-headed man, taking his hands out of his breeches pockets,
advanced on this summons, and throwing Miss Slarp's trunk ocr is
shoulder, carriel it into the house.

The lady aldressedl as Mrs. Tinker, at tlis moment made her appear-
ance with a pipe and a paper of tobaceo, for which she had been despatched
a minute befure Miss Sharp's arrival; and she landed the articles over to
Sir Pitt, who had taken his seat by the fire.
eWhere 's the farlen '' said he. `I gave youthree lalfpence. Where's
the changef old Iinker,''
Therel'' replied Mrs. Tinker, flingiag down the coin; ``it 's only
baronets as cares about farthings.''
` A frthing a day is seven shillings a year,'' answered the M.P.;
``seven shillings as year is the interest of seen guineas. Take care of your
farthings, old Tinker, and your guineas will come quite nat'ral.''
 You may be sure it's Sir Pitt Crawley, young woman,'' said Mrs.
Tiuker, surlily; ``becnuse he looks to his farthings. lou'll know him
hetter afore long.''
'And like me none the worse, Miss Slrp,'' said the old gentleman,
with an air almost of politeness.  I must be just before I'm generous,''

 Nover, and never will : it's aginst y principle. Go and get another
chir from the kitehen, Tinker, if you want to sit down; and then we'll
have a bit of supper.''
Tresently the baronet plungel a fork into the saucepan on the fire, and
withdrew from the pot a pieee of tripe nnd un onion, which he diided into
pretty equal portions, and of which he prtook with Mrs. Tinker.  You
see, Miss Sharp, when I'm not here Tinker's on bord wages: when
I'm in town she dines with the family. Hawl hawl I' glad Miss
Sharp's not humgry, ain't you, TinkP''  And they fell to upon their frugal
supper.
After supper Sir Pitt Crawley begn to smoke his pipe; and when it
became quite dark, he lightcd the rushlight in the tin candlestick, and pro-
ducing from an interminnble pocket a huge muss of popers, began reading
them, und putting them in order.
I'im here on law business, y dear, andl tlhat 's low it happens thnt I
shall have the pleasure of such a pretty travelling companion to-morrow.''
He's always ut law business,'' said Mrs. Tinker, taking up the pot of
porter.

 She was as bad as he,'' said Tinker. `` She took the law of every one of
her tradesmen; and turned away forty-eight footmen in four year.''
`` She was close-very close,'' said the baronet, simply; '' but she was s
ralyble womnn to me, and saved me a stewrd.''-Mnd in this confidential
strain, and much to the amusement of the new-comer, the conversation
continued for n consilerable time. Whatever Sir Pitt Crawley's qualities
might be, gool or bal, he did not make tle least disguise of them. He
talked of himself incessantly, somctimes in thc coarsest and vulgarest
Hampshire accent; sometimes adopting the tone of a man of tle world.
And so, with injunctions to Miss Sharp to be ready nt five in the moruing,
he bade her good night. : You 'll sleep with Tinker to-night,'' he said;
It's a big bed, and thero's room for two. Ludy Crawley dicd in it.
Good night.''
Sir Pitt went off uafter this benediction, and the solemn Tinker, rushlight
in hand, led the way up the great bleak stone stairs, past the great dreary
drawing-room doors, with the handles muffled up in paper, into the great
front bed-room, where ILady Crawley had slept her last. The bed and
chamber ware so funcreal and gloomy, you might have fanceied, not only
that Lady Crawley died in the room, but that her ghost inhabited it.
lebecca sprang about the npartment, however, with the greatest liveliness,
and had peeped into the uge wardrobes, and the closets, and the cupboards,

and tried the drawers which were locked, and examined the dreary pictures
and toilette appointments, while the old charwoman was saying her prayers.
I shouldn't like to sleep in this yeer bed without a good conscience,
Miss,'' said the old woman.  There 's room for us and a half-dozen of
ghosts in it,'' says Rebeccea. : Tell me nll about Lady Crawley and Sir
Pitt Crawley, and everybody, my dear Mrs. Tinker.''
But old Tinker was not to be pumped by this little cross-questioner; and
signifying to her tlt bed was a place for sleeping, not conersation, set up
in her corner of the bed such a snore as only the nose of innocence cnn
produce. Rebecea lay awake for a long, long time, thinking of the morrow,
anl of the new world into which she was going, and of her chaees ot
suceess there. The rushlight flickered in the basin. The mantel-piece
cast up a great blaek shadow, orer half of a mouldy old sampler, which her
defunct ladyship had workcd, no doubt, and over two little family pictures
of young lads, one in a college gown, and the other in a red jacket like a
soldier. When she went to slcep, lebccca chose that one to dream about.
At four o'cloek, on such a roseate summer's moruing as even male
Great Gaunt Street look cheerful, the faithful Tinker, haing wakened her
bedfellow, and bid her prepare for departure, unbarred and unbolted the
great hall door, (the clanging und clapping whereof startled the sleeping
echoes in the street), and taking her way into Oxford Street, summoned a
coach from a stand there. It is needless to particularize the uumber of
the vehicle, or to state that the driver was stationed thus early in th
neighbourhool of Swallow Street, in hopes that some young buck, reeling
homeward from the tavern, might need the aid of his vehicle, and pay him
with the generosity of intoxicntion.
It is likewise necdless to say, that the driver, if he had any such hopes
s thosc above stated, was grossly disappointed; and that the worthy
Baronet wlom he drove to the City did not give him one single penny
nore thnn is fuare. It was in vain that Jehu appealed and stormed; that
he flung down Miss Sharp's bandboxes in the gutter at the 'Necks, and
swore he would take the luw of his fare.
 You'd better not,'' said one of the ostlers; ` it's Sir Pitt Crawley,''
 So it is, Joe,'' cried tle Baronet, approvingly; ``and I'd like to see
the man can do me,''
 So should oi,'' said Joe, grinning sulkily, and mounting the baronet's
baggage on the roof of the conch.
 Keep the box for mne, Leader,'' exclaims the Member of Parliament to
tle coachman; wlo replied, ' Yes, Sir Pitt,'' with a touch of his hat, and
rage in his soul, (for he hud promised the box to a young gentleman from
Cnnbridge, who would have given a crown to a certainty), and Miss Sharp
was accomnmodatel with n baek seat inside the carriage, which may be said
to be carrying hcer into the wide world.
Iow the young man from Cambridge sulkily put his fie great eonts in
ront ; but was reconciled when little MIiss Sharp was made to quit the
carriage, and mount up beside him-when he oovered her up in one of his
Benjamins, and becme pcrfectly good-humoured-how the asthmatic

Miue Reeeea 8larp o Miss Amnelia Sedley, Rsell Square, Iodon.
(Free.-Pitt Orawley.)
MY DEEsT, sWEETEST AIELIA,
 With what ingled joy and sorrow do I take up the pen to write
t my dearest friendl Oh, what a clange between to-day and yesterdayl
Nowo I am friendless and alone; yesterday I was at home, in the sseet
eoempany of a sister, wlom I shall ever eser cherishl
``I will not tell you in what tears and sadness I psssed the fatal night
in which I separated from you. Iou went on Tuesday to joy and happi
ness, with your mother and your decoted young soldier by your side; and
I thought of you all night, dancing at the Perkins's, the prettiest, I am
sure, of all the young ladies at the Ball. Iwas brought by the groom in tho
old carriage to Sir Pitt Crawley's town house, where, after John the groom

had behaved most rudely and insolently to me (alasl 'twas safe to insult
poverty and misfortune :), I was given over to Sir P,'s care, and made to
pass the night in an old gloomy bed, nand by the side of a horrid gloomy
old charwoman, who keeps the house. I did not sleep one single wink
the whole night.
 Sir Pitt is not wlat we silly girls, when we used to real Cecilia at
Chiswick, imagined a baronet must hae been. Anything, indeed, less
like Lord Orville cannot be imngined. Fancy an old, stumpy, short,
vulgar, and very dirty man, in old clothes and shabby old gaiters, wlo
smokes a horrid pipe, and cooks his own horrid supper in a saucepan.
He speaks with a country accent, and swore a great deal at the old char-
woman, at the hackney coachman who drove us to the inn where the coach
went fro, and on which I made the journey outside for thle greater part
of tle ay.
I wns wakened at dybresk by the charwoman, and haing arried at
the inn, was nt first placed inside the coach. But, when we got to
a place called Leakington, where the rain began to fall very heavily-will
you believe it?-I was forced to come outside ; for Sir Pitt is a proprietor
of the coach, and as a passenger came at Mudbury, who wanted an inside
place, I was obliged to go outsile in the rain, where, however, a young
gentleman from Cambridge College sheltered me very kindly in one of his
several great coats.
This gentleman and the guard seemed to know Sir Pitt cry well, and
laughed at him a great deal. They both agreed in calling lim an old scree,
which means a very stingy, avaricious person. lle never gives any money
to any body, they said (and this meanness I hate); and the young gentle-
man made me remark that we drove very slow for the lust two stages on
the road, because Sir Pitt wns on tle box, and because he is proprietor of
the horses for this part of the journey. But won't I flog 'em on to
Squashmore, when I take thc ribbons ' said the young Cantab. `And
sarve 'em right, Mnster Jack,' said the guard. When I comprelended
thc meaning of this phrase, and that Master Jack intended to drive the
rest of the way, and revenge himsclf on Sir Pitt's horses, of course
I laughcd too.
`A carriage and four splendid horses, eovered with armorial beasrings,
however awaited us at Mudbury, four miles from ueen's Crawley, and
we made our entrance to the baronet's park in state. There is a fine
avenue of a mile long leading to tle house, and the woman at the lodge-
gute (over the pillars of which are a serpent aund a dove, the supporters of
the Crawley arms,) made us a numer of curtsies as she flung open the
old iron carved doors, which are something like those at odious Chiswick.
 eTherc 's an avenue,' said Sir Pitt, `nmile long. There's six thousand
pound of timbcr in them there trees. Do you call that nothingP' He
pronounces avenue-evenae, and nothing-othink, so droll; and hc hnd
n Mr. Holson, his hind from Mudbury, into the carriage with him, and
they talked about distraining, and selling up, and draining and subsoiling,
and a great denl about tenants and farming-much more than I could
understand. Sam Miles had beecn csught pouching, and Peter Bailey had
gone to the workhouse at lnst. `Serve him right,' said Sir Peter;  ' him

and his fam'ly has been cheating me on tt farm these hundred and fifty
years.' Some old tenant, I suppose, who could not pay his rent. Sir
Pitt miglt have said `e and his fumily,' to be sure; but rich baronets do
not need to be careful about grammnr, as poor goernessees must be.
`'`As we passed, I remarked a beuautiful church-spire rising above soe old
elms in the park; and before them, in the midst of a lawn, and some
outhouses, an old red house with tall chimneys covered with ivy, aud the
windows shining in the sun.`Is that your church, sir?' I said.
Yes, hang it,' (said Sir Pitt, only he used, dear, a nucl wickeder
weord); ` how's Buty, HodsonP Buty 's y brother lute, my deuar-uy
brother the prson. Buty and the Beast I cull im, ha, lal'
`IIodson laughed too, and then looking more grave anl nodding his
head, said, `I'm afraid he's better, Sir Pitt. He was out on his poy
yesterday, looking at our corn.'
: Looking after his tithes, hang 'un (only he used the same wicked
word). Will branly and water never kill him e's as tough as old
whatdyecallum-old Methusalem.'
`'Mr. Hodson laughed agasin. `The young men is home from college.
They'e whopped John Seroggins till hc's well nigh dead.'
Whop my second keeper!' roared out Sir Pitt.
He was on the parson's ground, sir,' replied Mr. Holson; and
Sir Pitt in as fury swaore that if ever he caught 'em pouchuing on his
ground, he'd transport 'em, by the lord he would. Howcver, he snid,
`1'e sold the presentution of the living, Hodlsor ; uone of that brced shall
get it I war'nt;' and Mr. Hodson said he was quite right: and I lave no
doubt from this that the two brothers are at varionee-as brothers often
are, and sisters too. Don't you remember the two Mliss cratchlcy's at
Chiswick, how they nsed always to tight and quarrel-and Mlary ox,
how she was always thumping Louisaf'
 Presently, seeing two little boys gatheriug sticks in the wood, MIr.

them with his whip. Pitch into 'em Hodson,' rored the baroet:
`flog their little souls out, and bring 'em up to the house, the vagalonds;
I'll commit 'em as sure as my name's Pitt.' And presently we heard
Mr. Iolson's whip elacking on the shoulders of the poor little blubber-
ing wretches, and Sir Pitt, seeing that the malefactors were in custody,
rove on to the hall.
` All the servants were ready to meet us, anud

Before the house of ueen's Crawley, which is an odious old-faslionel
red briek mansion, with tall chimueys and gables of tle style of ueen
Bess, there is a terrace flanked by the family dove and secrpent, and on
which the great hall door opens. And oh, my dear, the great hall I o
ure is as big and as glum as the great hall in the dear csstle of Udolplo.
It has a large fire-place, in which we might put half Miss Pinkerton's
school, and the grate is big enough to roast an ox at the very least.
Round the room hang lI don't know how many generations of Crawleys,
some with beanrds and rufs, some with huge wigs and toes turned out;
some dressed in long straight stasys and gons that look as stiff as
towcrs, nnd some with long ringlets, and, oh my denrl scarcely any stays
at all. At one end of the hll is the great stairease all in black oak, as
dismal as may be, and on either side are tall doors witl stag's heads over
them, leading to the billiard-room and the library, and the grent yellow
saloon and the morning-rooms. I think there are atleast twenty bed-rooms
on the first floor; one of them has thc bed in which ucen Elizabeth
alept; and I have been taken by my new pupils tlough all these fin
apartments this morning. They are not reudered less gloomy, I promise
you, by having the shutters always shut; and there is scnrce one of the
apartments, but when the light was let into it, I expectel to see n ghost
in the room. We hnve a school-room on the second floor, with my bed-
room leading into it on one side, and that of the young ladies on the
other. Then there are, Mr. Pitt's partments-Mr. Crawley, he is called-
the cldest son, nd Mr. Rawdon Crawley's rooms-he is an officer likc
soelody, and away with his regiment. There is no wnnt of room I
assure you. You might lodge all the peoplo in Russell quare in the
housc, I think, nnd lave space to spare.
eIIalf an hour after our arrival, the great dinner bell wns rung, anl I
ce down with my two pupils (tley are very thin insignificant little
chits of ten and eight years old). I came down in your dear muslin
gown (about which that odious Mrs. Pinuuer was so rude, becnuse you
gave it me); for I am to be treated as one of the family, except on com-
pany days, when the young ladies and I are to dine up-stairs.
 Well, the great dinner bell rang, and we asll assebled in the little
lrawing-room where my Lady Crawley sits. She is the seecond Laly Craw-
ley, and mother of the young lndies. She was an ironmonger's daughter,
and her marriage was thought a great match. She looks as if she had
been handsome once, and her eyes are always wecping for the loss of her
beauty. She is pale and meagre and ligh-shouldered; nnd has not a
word to say for herself, evidently. Her step-son, Mr. Crawley, was like-
wise in the room. He was in full dress, as pompous as an undertaker.
He is pale, thin, ugly, silent; he las thin legs, no chest, hay-coloured
whiskers, and straw-coloured hair. He is the very picture of his sainted
mother over the mantel-piece-Griselda of the noble house of Binkie.

glance that I need not bhe afraid of tat woman.'
My Lady is served,' says the Butler, in blaek, in an immense white
shirt-frill, that looked as if it had been one of the Gueen Elizabeth ruffs
depicted in the hall; and so tking Mr. Crawley's arm, she led the way to
the dining-roomn, whither I followed with my little pupils in each hand.

Sir Pitt was already in the room with a silver jug. He had just bcen
to the cellar, and was in full dress too; that is, he hnd taken his giters
off, and showed his little dumpy legs in black worsted stockings. The
side-board was covered with glistening old plate-old cups, both gold and
silver ; old salvers and cruet stands, like Rundell and Brilge's shop.
Everything on the table was in silver too, and two footmen, with red hair
and canary-coloured liveries, stood on either side of the side-bonrd.
: Mr. Crawley said a long graee, and Sir Pitt suid amen, and the great
zilver dish-coers were removed.
s What have we for dinner, Betsy ?' said the Buronet.
eMutton broth, I believe, Sir Pitt,' answered Lay Crawley.

Mfouton au naets,' added the Butler gravely, (pronounce, if you please,
moutongonasy); `and the soup is otage de nouton a Ecossise. The
side dishes contain pommes de terre au nataurel, and clofeur d l'eau.'
Mutton's mutton,' said the Baronet, ` and a devilish good thing.

 Steel, of Mudbury, took the saddle and two lega, Sir Pitt; but he says
the last was too young and confounded woolly, Sir Pitt.'
eWill you take some potage 2 Miss ah-MIiss Blunt,' said Mr. Cralcy.
Capitnl Scotch broth, my dear,' said Sir Pitt, ` though they cll it
by a French name.'
 I elieve it is the custom, sir, in deeent socicty,' said M. Crawley,
haughtily, `to call the dish as I have called it ;' and it was served to ns
on silver soup-plates by the footmen in the canary coats, with the outon
au anaets. Then ` nle and water' were brought, and served to us
young ladies in wine-glasses. I am not a judge of ale, but I cn say with
a clenr conscienee I prefer water.
 Whilce we were enjoying our repast, Sir Pitt took occasion to ask what
had become of the shoulders of the mutton ?
I believe they were caten in the servants' hall,' snid my lady, humbly.
They wns, my lady,' said Horroeks, `and precious little else wc get
there neithler.'
:Sir lPitt burst into a hoarse laugh, and continued his conversation with
Mr. Iorrocks. That there little blaek pig of tle Kent sow's breed must
be uncommon fat no,'
 It 's not quite busting, Sir Pitt,' ssid the Butler with the gravest air,
at which Sir Pitt, anl withl him the young ladics, this tine, began to laugh
violently.
Miss Crawley, Miss Rose Crawley,' snil MIr. Crawley, `your laughtecr
strikes me as being exceedingly out of place.'
e Never mind my Lord,' said tle Baronet, `we'll try the porker on
Saturlay. Kill 'un on Sturday morning, John Horrocks. Miss Sharp
adores pork, don't you, Miss Sharp?'
And I think this is all the conversation that I remember at dinncr.
When the repast was coneluded a jug of hot water was placed before Sir
Pitt, with a case-bottle coutaining, I beliee, rum. Mr. IIorrocks servcl
myself and my pupils with threc little glasses of wine, and a bumer was
poured out for my laly. When e retired, she took from her work-
drawer an enormous interminable picce of knitting; the young ladics
began to play at cribbnge with a dirty pack of cards. We hnl but one
candle lightel, but it was in amagificent old siler candlestick, and after a
very few questions from my lady, I had my cloice of amusement betwecn
n volume of srmons, and a pamphlet on the corn-laws, whichl Mr. Crawley
hal been reading before dinner.
` So wc sat for an hour until steps were learl.
 Put away the cnrds, girls,' cried y lady, in a great tremor; put
dou Mr. Crawley's books, Miss Shar:' and thcse orders had becn
scarccly obeyed, when Mr. Crawley entered the room.
A N0VEL WITHIOUT A IIERO.
71
 e will resume yesterday's discourse, young ladics,' snid he, 'anl
you shall each read a page by turns; so that Mliss a-Miss Short may
have an opportunity of hearing you;' and the poor girls began to spell a
long disual sermon delivered at bBethesa Chapel, Liverpool, in behalf of
the mission for the Chickasaw Indians. Was it not a churming cvening ?
At ten the servants were told to canll Sir litt and the houseliold to
prayers. Sir Pitt came in first, very mucl fluslcd, and rather unsteady in
his gait; and after him tle butler, the cnnurics, Mr, Crawley's man, tlree
other men, smelling very much of tle stable, und four women, one of whom,
I remarked, was very much oer-dressed, and who flung me a look of great
scorn as she plumped down on her knees.
Afer Mr. Crawley had done haranguing and expounding, we reccivel
our candles, and tlen we went to bed; and then I was disturbed in y
writing, as I have deseribed to my dearest sweetest Aelia.
e Good night. A thousand thousand thousnnd kissesl' '
``Saturday.-This moruing, at fve, I heard tho shrieking of the little
black pig. Rose and Violet iutroduced me to it yesterday; and to th
stables, and to the kennel, aud to the gardener, who was picking fuit to
send to market, and from whom they begged hard a buneh of hot-house
grapes; but he snid thnt Sir Pitt had numbered every `` Man Jack'' of
them, and it would be as much as his place was worth to give nny away.
The darling girls caught a colt in a paddock, and asked me if I would ride,
and began to ride thcmselves, wlhen the groom, coming with horrid oaths,
drove them away.
``Lady Crawley is always knitting the worstel. Sir Pitt is always tipsy,
every night; and, I believe, sits with Horrocks, the butler. MIr. Crawley
always reads sermons in the eening; and in the morning is locked up in
his study, or else rides to MIudbury, on county business, or to Squashmore,
wherc he preaches, on Wednesdays and Fridays, to the tenauts there.
`' A hundred thousand grateful loves to your dear papa and mamma. Is

Everything consilered, I think it is quite as well for our dear Amclia
Sedley, in Russell Square, that MIiss Slarp and she nre parted. Rebecca
is a droll funny creature, to be sure: and those descriptions of the poor
lady weeping for the loss of her bcauty, and the gentleman ``with lay-
coloured whiskers and straw-coloured hair,'' are very smart, doubtlcss, and
show a great knowlelge of the world. That she might, when on her
knees, have been thinking of something better than Miss IIorroeks's
ribbons, has possibly struck both of us. But my kind rcader will plcasc
to remember that these histories in thir gaudy yellow covers have
Vnnity Fair'' for a title, and that Vanity Fair is a very vain, wicked,
foolish place, full of all sorts of humbugs and Ialsencsses nnd pretensions.

bands, but only tle ery same long-eared livery in which his congregation
is arrayed: yet, look you, one is bound to speak the truth as far as one
knows it, whether one mounts a cap and bells or a shovel-hat; and a
denl of disagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an under-
tuking.
I have hearl a brother of the story-telling trade, at Naples, preaching
to a pack of good-for-nothing lonest lazy fellows by the sea-shore, work
himself up into such n rnge and passion with some of the villains whose
wicked deeds he was deseribing and inventing, that the audience could not
resist it; and thcy and the poet together would burst out into a roar of
onths and execrations against the fictitious monster of the tnle, so that the
hat went round, and the bjocchi tumblel into it, in the midst of a perfect
storm of sympathy.
At the little Paris theatres, on the other hand, you will not only hear
the people yelling out ``l gredin / l moatre /'' and cursing the tyrant
of the play from the boxes; but thec actors themselves positively refuse to
play the wicked parts, sucl as those of infies fnglais, brutal Cossacks, and
what not, and prefer to appear at a smaller salury, in their real charactersas
loyal Frenchmen. I set thc two stories one against the other, so that you
may sce that it is not from mere mercenary motives that the present
performer is desirous to show up and trounce his villains; but because he
has a sincere hatred of them, which he cannot keep down, and which must
find a vent in suitable abuse nnd bad language.
I warn my ``kyind friends,'' then, that I am going to tell a story of harrow-
ing villany and complicatel-but, as I trust, intensely interesting-erime.
My rascals nre no milk-and-water rascals, I promise you. When we come
to the proper places we won't spare fine language-No, nol But when
we arce going over the quiet country we must perforce be calm. A
tempest in a slop-asin is absurd. We will reserve that sort of tling for
the mighty ocean and the lonely miduight. The present Number will be
very mild. Others-But e will not anticipate tlose.
And, as we bring our characters forward, I will ask leae, as a man and
n brother, not only to introduce thcem, but occasionally to stcp down from
the platform, and talk about then : if thcy are good nnd kindly, to love
them and shakc them by the hanud: if they are silly, to laugh at tlem
confidentially in the reader's sleeve : if they are wicket and heartless, to
abuse them in the strongcst terms which politeness amits of,
Otherwise you might fancy it wns I wlo was sneering at the practice of
devotion, whiech Miss Sharp finds so ridieulons; that it was I who laughed
good humouredly at the reeling old Silenus of a baronet-whereas the
laughter comcs from one who has no reerence except for prosperity, and
no eye for anything beyond success. Such people there are living and
flourishing in the world-Faithless, Hopeless, Charityless : let us have at
them, dear frienls, with might nd main. Some there are, and very suc-
cessful too, mere quacks and fools: and it was to combat and expose such
ns those, no dout, that Laughter was male.

the Wapshot girls had not the preference in the marriage, anl the remain-

This might have bcen, but for you, a cheery lass :-Peter Butt and Rose a

Hlarry the Eighth or Bluebeard were alive now, and wanted a tenth wife,
do you suppose he could not get the prettiest girl that shall be presented

The languid ullness of their nma did not, as it may be supposed,
awaken much affeetion in her little daughters, but they were very happy i
the serants' hall and in the stables; anl the Scotch gardener having luekily
a good wife and some good children, they got a little wholesome society
and instruction in his lodge, which was the only education bestowel upon
them until Miss Sharp came.
HIcr engagement was owing to the remonstrances of Mr, Pitt Crawvley,
the ouly friend or proteetor Lady Crawsley ever had, and the ouly person,
bcsides her children, for whom she entertained a little feeble attaehment.
Mr. Pitt took after the noble Binkics, from whom le was descended, and
was a ery polite and proper gentleman. When he grew to man's estate,
nnl eame bsek from Christchurch, he began to reforn tle slaekened disci-
pline of the hall, in spite of his father, who stood in nwe of him. He was
 man of such rigid refinement, that he would hnve starved rather than
have dined without a white neek-eloth. Once, when just frou college, and
when HIorroeks the butler brought him a letter without placing it previ-
ously on a tray, he guve that domestic a look, and administered to him a
speeeh so cutting, that IIorrocks ever after trembled efore him: the whole
household bowel to him: Iady Crawley's curl-papers came off earlier
when he was t home : Sir itt's uddy gsiters disappcarel; and if tlat
incorrigible old man still ndhered to otlcr old habits, he never fuddled
hiself with rum and water in his son's presence, and ouly talked to lis
ervts in a ery reserved and polite manner; and those persons remarkel
that Sir Pitt never swore at Lndy Crawlcy wlile his son was in tle room.
It was he who taght the butler to say `` My lady is serred,'' und wlo
insisted on handing her ladyship into diuner. IIe seldom spoke to her,
but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let
her quit the apartment, without rising in the most stately manner to open
te door, and making an elegant liow at her egress.
At lEton he was called Miss Crawley; anl there, I am sorry to say, his
younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently. But though his parts
were not brilliant, he made up for his lack of talent by meritorious industry,

and was never known, during eight years at sclool, to hc sulject to that
punishment, whicl it is generally thought one but a cherub can cscape.
At college his career was of course highly crelitable. And here he pre-
pared himself for public life, intowhich le was to be introduced by the patron-
age of lis grandfathier, Lord Binkie, by studying the ancicnt nnd modern
orators with great assiduity, and by speaking unceasingly at thc debaling
societies. But though he lad n fine tlux of words, nnd lelivered his littla
voice with great pomposity and plcnsure to himself, and never advaneed
any sentiment or opiuion which was not perfectly trite and stale, nud sup-
ported by a Latin quotation:; yct he failed somehow, in spite of a medi-
ocrity which ought to have insured nny mnn n success. He did not even
get the prize poem, which all his friends snid he wns surce of.
After leaving college he became Privute Seeretary to Lord Binkie, and
was thcn appointed Attache to the Legation ut Pupernickel, wlich post
he filled with perfect honour, and brought home despatches, consisting of
Strasburg pie, to the Foreign Minister of the day. After remaining ten
years Attachc (seeral years after the lamented Lord Binkie's demise), and
finding the advancement slow, he at length gave up the diplomatic service
in some disgust, anl began to turn couutry gentlemun.
He wTote a pamphlet on Malt on retuurning to England (for he wns
an ambitious man, and always likel to bUe before the public), anl took a
strong part in the Negro Emncipation question. Then he becamc a
fricnd of MIr. Wilberforee's, whose politics he atmired, and had tht
famous correspondence with the Revercnd Silas Hornblower, on the
Ashautee Mission. Hc was in Loudon, if not for the Prliament session,
ant least in May, for the religions eetings. In the country he was a
mngistrate, and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute
of religious instruction. He was snid to be paying his nddresscs to Lady
Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdowu's third laughter, nnd wose sister,
Laly Emily, wrote those sweet traets, ``The Sailor's True Binnucle,'' and
eThe Applewomn of Finchley Common,''
Miss iharp's account of his cmployment at ueen's Crawley were not
caricatures. He subjectel the servnuts there to the devotional exercises
efore mentioned, in which (and so mucl the better) he brought his father
to join. He patroniscd an ludependent mceting-house in Crawley parish,
much to the indignation of his uncle the rector, and to the consequent
delight of Sir Pitt, who was induced to go himself once or twice, wlich
oecusioned some violent scrmons at Crnwley parish chureh, dirccted point-
blank at the Baronet's old gothic pew thcre. IIonest Sir Pitt, hoever,
did not feel the force of these discourses, us he always took lis nap during
sermon-time.
Mr. Crawley was very earnest, for the good of the nation and of the
Christian world, that the old gentleman should yield him up his plaee in
Parliament ; but tlis the clder constantly refused to do. lBoth were of
course too prudeut to givo up the fifteeu hndred a enr whieh was
brought in by the seeond seat (at this periol filled by MIr. ualroon,
with carte-blanche on the Slnve question); indeed the family estate was
mnuch embarrassed, and the income druwn from the borough was of great
use to the house of ueen's Crawlcy.
76
AIIY FAIR.
It hnd never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawley,
frst baronet, for peeulation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office. Sir
Wulpole was a jolly fellow, eager to seize and to spend money (``alieni
appetens, sui profusus,'' as Mr. Crawley would remark with a sigh), and in
lis duy beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and hospi-
tality which was maintained at ueen's Crawley. The cellars were filled
with burgundy thcn, tle kennels with hounls, anl the stables with gallant
hunters; now, such horses as ueen's Crawley possessel went to plough,
or ran in tle Trafalgar Coach ; and it was wth a team of these very
horses, on an off-day, that Miss Sharp was brought to the Hall ; for, boor
as le was, Sir Pitt was a stickler for his dignity while at home, and seldom
drove out but with four horses, and, though he dined off boiled mutton,
had always three footmen to serve it.
If mere parsimony would have made a man rich, Sir Pitt Crawley might
have become very wealthy-if he had been an attorney in n country town,
with no cnpital but his brains, it is very possible that he woull have
turned them to good account, and might have achievel for himself a vcry
considerable influcnce and compctency. But hc was unluckily cndowel
with a good name and a large tlough encumlered estate, both of which
went rather to injure than to adance him. HIe had a taste for law,
which cost him mauy thousnnds ycarly; nnd bcing a greut deal too clever
to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his nffairs ta
be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all cqally mistrusted. IIe was
such n slarp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt
tenants; and such a close fuarmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the
ground, whereupon revengeful Nnture grudged him the crops which she
granted to more liberal lusbantmen. Ile speculated in every possible
wa; he worked mines ; bought canal-shares; horsed conches; took
goverment contraets, and was the busiest man and mugistrate of his
county. As he would not pay honest agents at his grauite-quarry, he had
the satisfaction of fiuding that four overseers ran away, aud took fortues
with them to America. For want of proper precautions, his conl-mines
filled with water : tle government flung his contract of damaged beef upon
his hands: and for his coach-horses, esery mail proprietor in thc kingdom
knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country, from under-
fecding and buying cheup. In disposition he was sociable, and far from
being proud; nay, hc rather prcferred the society of a farmer or a horse-
dlealer to that of a gentleman, like my Lord, his son: he was fond
of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was never
known to give away a shilling or to do a good aetion, but was of a
pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his glass
with a tenant and sell him up the next duy; or have his laugh with tle
poacher he was transporting with cqual good humour. lis politeness for
the fair sex las already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca Shurp-in a word,
the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England, did not contain a
more cunning, menn, selfish, foolish, disreputable old man. That blood-
red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would bc in anybody's poeket except his
own; and it is with grief and pain, that, as admirers of the British
nristocruacy, we find ourselves obliged to admit the cxistence of so many ill
qualities in a person whose name is in Debrett.
A NoYEL W1TIIOUT A IIERO.
77
One great cause why Mr. Crawley hal sucl a loll oer the affections
of his father, resulted from money arruangements. The Buronet owed his
son a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother, whicl he did not
find it convenient to pay; indeed he had an nlmost invincible repugnanee
to paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to lischargc his
debts. Miss Sharp culculated (for she becne, as we shall hcnr speedily,
inducted into most of the secrets of the fnmily) thut the mere payent of
his creditors cost the honourable baronet several hundreds ycarly; but
this was a delight he could not forego ; he had n savage pleasure iu maksing
the poor wretches wait, and in shiftiug from court to court uud from term
to ter the period of satisfaction. What's the good of being in arliament,
he said, if you must pay your debts Ience, indeced, his position as a
senator was not a little usoeful to him
Vunity Fair-Vanity Fuairl Ilere was a mn, who could not spell, and
did not care to rend-who hal the habits and tle cunning of n boor: whosc
ai in life was pettifogging: who never had a taste, or emotion, or ejoy-
ment, bUut what was sordid and foul; and yet he had rank, and lonours,
and power, somelow : and was n diguitnry of the land, and a pillar of thc
state. He was high shceriff, und rode in a golden coneh. Gret ministers
and statesmen courted him; and in Vanity lair hc had a higher place thn
the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue.
Sir Pitt had an unmarried half-sister who inherited her mother's targce for-
tune, and though the Baronet proposed to borrow this money of ler on mort-
gage, Miss Crawley deelined the offer, and preferred the security of the
fuuds. She had signified, howvever, her intention of leaving her inheritanes
between Sir Pitt's second son nnd the family at the rectory, and lmad ouce
or twice paid the debts of Hawdon Crawley in his career at college and
in the army. Miss Crawley was, in consequence, an objcct of great respect
when she came to ueen's Crnwley, for she had a balance at her banker's
which would have made her beloved anywlere.
WWhat a dignity it gives an old lady, that balance at thebanker'sl IIow

Bidley.
So she wisely determined to rcender her position with the ueen's
Crawley family comfortable and secure, nnd to this end resolved to mnke
friends of every one around her who could at nll interfere with her
comfort.
As my Lnady Crawley was not one of these personages, nd n woman,

family that she wiscly directed the chief part of her attentions.
With the young people, whose applause she thorouglly gained, her
ethod was pretty simple. She did uot pester their young brains with too
much learning, but, on the contrary, let them have their own way in regard
to cucating themeelves; for wlat instruction is more effectual tlan self-

Sealing Wax Office at tle period of his disgrace), and as nobody eer
troublel the book-shelves but herself, Relccca was enabled agreeably, and,
as it were, in plnying, to impart a great deal of instruction to Miss Rosc
Crawley.
Sho and Miss Rose thus rend together any delightful French and
Euglisl works, aong which may be nentioned those of the learned Dr.
Sollett, of the ingenious MIr. IIenry Ficlding, ol thc ;graefl and fantastic
Monsieur Crbillon the yoger, whom r iuuortal poet Gray so much
admirel, anl of the universal Monsieur de Yolairc. Once, when Mr.
Crawvley asked what the young people wuetc eaing, thc governess rcepliel
Smollett,''  Oh, Smollctt,'' said Mr. ruwley, quile satisfied.  IIis
history is more dull, but by no ens so duvus as tlt of Mr. Hume.
It is history you are reading P''  ,..'' sail Mliss llosc; without how-
ver, adding tlat it was the hiatory l lr. lluply Clinker. On
another occasion he was ratler scandalised at finding his sister with a
book of French plays; but as the governess remarked that it was for the
purpose of acquiring the French idiom in conrersation, he was fain to be
content. Mr. Crawley, as a diplomatist, was exsceedingly proud of his
own skill in speaking the French language, (for he was of the world still),
and not a little pleased with the compliments which the governess conti-
nually paid him upon hifieney.
Miss Yiolet's tnstes were, ch the contrary, more rude and boisterous
thnn those of her sister.- She knew thc seuestered spots where the hens
layed thcir eggs. Slc could clib a tree to rob the nests of the feathered
songters of their speckled spoils. And hecr plcasure was to ride the
youg eolts, and to scour tle plains like Camilla. She was the favourite
of her father and of the stable-men.. She was the darling, and witlal the
. trgg, the cook; for h discoveredl the haunts of the jam-pots, and
 woul' attuck them when they woere within er reach. She and her sister
were engaged in contnt battle. Any, of which peccadilloes, if Miss
Sharp discovered, she did not tll fhe to Lady Crawley, who would have
told them to the father, or, worse, to Mr. Crawley; but promised not to
tell ifr Miss Violet would be a good girl and love her goveruess.
With Mr. Crawley Miss Slarp was respectful and obedient. She used
to consult him on passages of French which she could not understand,
tlough her motler was a Frenchwoman, and wlich he would construe ta
her satisfaction: and, besides giving her his aid in profane literature, he
was kind enough to select for her books of a more serious tendeney, and
address to her much of his conversation, She admirel, beyondl measure,

A NOYEL WITEO A IIERO.
his speech at the uashimaboo-Ail Society; took an interest in his
pamphlet on malt; was often affected, even to tears, by his discourses of
nn evening, and would say-`' Oh, thank you, sir,'' with a sigh, nnd a
look up to heaven, that made him oceasionally condescend to shake hands
with her. :Blood is everything, after all,'' would that aristoeratic
religionist sny.  How Miss Sharp is awakened by my words, wlen not
one of the people here is touched. I am too fine for them-too delicte.
I must familiarise my style-but she understands it. Her mother was as
Montmorency.''
Indeed it was from this famous family, as it appenrs, that Miss Sharp,
by the mother's side, was descended. Of course she did not say that her
mother hd been on the stage; it wonld have shocked Mr, Crawley's
religious scruples. How mnny noble emirees had this horrid revolution
plunged in povertyl She had several stories ubout her ancestors ere shc
had been many months in the house; some of which MIr. Crawley hap-
pened to find in D'IIozier's dictionary, which was in the library, and
which strengthened his belief in their truth, and in the ligh-breeding ol
Rebecca. Are we to supposce from this curiosity nnd prying into diction-
aries, could our heroine suppose that Mr. Crawley was interested in her -
no, only in a friendly way. Hnve we not stated that he was attaced to
Lady Jane Sheephanks:
He took Rebeeca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at
backgummon with Sir Pitt, saying that it was n godless amusement, and
thut she would be much better engaged in reading `` Thrump's Legaey,''
or  The Blind Wuasherwoman of Moorfelds,'' or uny work of n more
ssrious nature; but Miss hrp sil he lear mother used ofen te pl
the same game with the old Couut de Trictrae and tle venerable Abb du
Cornet, and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusement.
But it was not only by playing at baekgnmmon with the Baronet, thiat
the little governess rendered herself agreeable to her employer. She
found many different wys of being useful to him. She rcal over, with
indefatigable paticence, all those law papers, with which, before she came to
ueen's Crawley, he lad promised to entertain her. She volunteered to
copy mny of lis letters, and adroitly altered the spelling of them so es
to suit the usages of the present day. She became interested in overy-
thing appertaining to the estate, to the farm, the park, the garden, and
the stables; and so delightful a companion wns she, that the Baronet
would sellom take his after-breakfast walk without her (and the children
of course), when she would give her advice as to the trees which were to be
lopped in the shrubberies, the garden-bels to be dug, the crops which
were to be cut, the horses which were to go to cart or plough. Beforo
she hnd been a year at Gueen's Crawley she had quite won the Bnronet's
oonfidence ; and the conversation at the dinner-table, whieh before used to
be held between him and Mr, Horrocks the butler, was now almost exclu-
sively between Sir Pitt and Miss Sharp. She was nlmost mistress of tho
honse wlien Mr. Crawley was absent, but conducted herself in her new and
exalted situntion with such circumspeetion and modesty as not to offend the
authorities of the kitchen and stable, among whom her behaviour was
always cxceedingly modest and affable. She was quite a different person

from the haughty, shy, dissatisfied little girl whom wc have known prei-
ously, and this change of temper proved grent prudenee, a sinccre desire of
amendment, or at any rate great moral courage on her part. WVhethcr it
was the heart which dictated this new system of complaisace and humility
adopted by our Rebecca, is to be proved by her after-history. A system
of hypocrisy, which lasts tlrough whole years, is one seldom satisfaetorily
practiscd by a person of one-and-twcnty ; howcver, our readers will recol-
lect, that, though young in years, our heroine was oll in life and experience,
and we have written to no purpose if thiey have not discovercd that shc
was a very clever woman.
1he elder and younger son of the housc of Crawley were, like the gentle-
man nnd lady in the wenther-box, never at home together-they hated eacn
other coriully: indeed, Rawdon Crawley, thc dragoon, had a great con-
tcmpt for the establishment altogethler, and seldom came thither excet
when his aunt paid her annunl visit.
The great good quality of this old lady has been mentioned. She pos-
scssed seventy thousand pounds, and hal almost ndopted Rawlon. She
lisliked her elder nephew cxceelingly, and dcspised him as a milksop.
In return he did not hesitate to state that her soul was irretrievably lost,
and was of opinion thiat his brother's chance in the next world was not a
whit bctter.  She is a godless womnn of the world,'' would Mr. Crawley
say; ``she lives with athcists and Frenclimen. My mniud shulders when I
think of her awful, awful situation, and that, near ns sle is to the gravc, she
should be so gien up to vanity, licentiousness, profaneness, and folly.'' In
fact, the old lady leclined altogether to hear his hour's lecture of an een-
ing; and when she camc to ueen's Crawley alone, he was obliged to
pretermit his usual devotional exercises.
`` Shut up your sarmons, Pitt, when Miss Crawley comes down,'' said
his fther; ``she has written to sy that she won't stand the preachifying.''
 O, sirl consider the servants,''
 The servants be hanged,'' said Sir Pitt; and his son thought even
worsc would happen were thcy deprived of the benefit of his instruction.
 Wy, hang it, Pitt.'' said the father to his remonstrance. You
wouldn't bc such a flat as to let three thousand a year go out of the
family ?'
e What is money compared to our souls, sir%'' continuel Crawley.
 You mean that the old lady won't leave the money to you ''-and
who knows but it as Mr. Crawley's meaning %
Old Miss Crawley was certainly one of the reprobate. She had a snug
little honse in Park Lane, and, as she ate and drank a great deal too much
during the season in London, she went to Harrowgate or Cheltenhum for
the summer. Sle was the most hospitable and jovial of oll vestals, and
lad been a beauty in her day, she said. (All old women were beauties onee
we very well kno.) She was a lel esprit, and n dreadful Radical for
those dnys. She hnd been in France (where St. Just, they sy, inspired
her with nn unfortunate passion), and loved, ever after, lrench noels,
French cookery, and rench wines. She read oltaire, and had Rousseau
by heart; talked very ligltly about divorce, and most energeticnlly of the
rights of women. She had pictures of Mr. Fox in every room in the

house: when that statesman was in opposition, I am not sure that she
ad not flung a main with him; and when he came into office, she took
great credit for bringing over to him Sir Pitt and his colleague for ueen's
Crawley, nlthough Sir Pitt would have come over himself, without any
trouble on the honeet laly's part. It is needless to ssy that Sir Pitt was
brought to change his views uafter the death of the great Whig statesman.
This worthy old lady took a faney to Rawdon Crawley when a boy,
sent him to Cambridge (in opposition to his brother ant Oxford), and, when
the young mnn was requested by the authoritics of the first-named Univer-
sity to quit after a residence of two years, she bought him his commissions
in the Life Guards Green.
A perfect and celebrated ``lool,'' or dndy about town, was this
young officer. Boxing, rat-hunting, the fives' court, and four-in-hand
driving were then the fuashion of our British aristocracy; and he was an
adept in all these noble sciences. And though he belonged to the house-
holl troops, who, as it was their duty to rally round the Prince Regent,
hd not shown their vulour in foreign service yet, Rawlon Crawley had
already (apropo of play, of which he ws immoderately fond) fought three
bloody duels, in which he gave ample proofs of his contempt for death.
And for whant follows nfter denth,'' would Mr. Cruawley observe,
throwing his gooseberry-coloured eyes up to the ceiling. He wns always
thinking of his brother's soul, or of the souls of those who differed with
him in opinion: it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give
themnselves.
Silly, romantic Miss Crawley, far from being horrified at the courage
of her favonrite, always used to pay his debts after his duels; and would
not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality. : He will
sow his wild-oats,'' she would,say, '` and is worth far more than that puling
hypocrite of n brother of his,''

at the Hall, (whose
simplicity and sweet
rural purity surely slow
tle advantage of a
couutry life over a
town one;) we must
introduce the rcaler
to their relatives and
neighbours nt the Rec-
tory, Bute Craley and
his wile.
The Beverend Bute
Crawley was a tall,
stately, jolly, slovel-
hatted man, far more
popular in his county than the Baronet lis brother. At college he pullel
stroke-oar in the Christchurch boat, and had thrashed all the best bruisers
of the ``town.'' He carried is taste for boxing an athlctic exercises
into private life: there was not a fight within twenty miles at which lc
was uot present, nor a race, nor a coursing match, nor a regatt, nor
a ball, nor an election, nor a visitation dinner, nor indeed a good dinner
in the whole county, but he found means to attend it. lou might see
his bay-mare and gig-lamps a score of miles away from his Rectory ouse,
whenever there was any dinnerparty at Fuddleston, or at Roxby, or nt
Wapshot Hull, or at the great lords of the couuty, with all of whom he
was itimate. IIe had a fine voice; sang `` A southerly wind and a cloudy
sky;'' and gve the `'whoop'' in chorus with general applause. He rode
to hounds in a pepper-and-salt frock, and was one of the best fishermen
in the county.
Mrs. Crawley, the reetor's wife, was a smart little body, who wrote this
worthy divine's sermons. Being of a domestic turn, and keeping the
house a great deal with her daughters, she ruled absolutely within the
reetory, wisely giving her husband full liberty witlout. He was welcome
to come and go, and dine abroad as many days ns his fancy dictatcd, for
Mrs. Crawley was a saving woman and knew the price of port wine.
Ler since MIrs. Bute earried of the young rector of Gueen's Crawley (shs
was of a good family, daughter of the late Lieut.-Colonel Heetor MaeTavish,
and she and her mother played for Bute and won him at Hlarrogate), she
hai been a prudent and thrifty wife to him. In spite of her care, how-
vcr, he was always in debt. It took him at least ten years to pay of

his eollege bills contraeted during his fuather's life time. In the year 170-,
when he was just elear of these incumbrnnces, he gave the odds of
100 to 1 (in twenties) against Kangaroo, who won the Derby. The
rector was obliged to take up the money at a ruinous intcrest, and had
een struggling eer sinec. Ilis sister helped himn with a hundred now
and then, but of course his great hope was in her deuth-when `hang
it' (as he would sny), `Mntildn nst leuve me half her money.'
So that the Baronet nnd his brother had every reason which two
brothers possibly can have for being by the ears. Sir Pitt hd had the
better of Bute in innumerable family transactions. Ioung TPitt not only
did not hunt; but set up a meeting-house undcr lis uncle's very nose.
awdon, it was know, wus to come in for the bulk of MIiss Crawly's
properly. Ihesc money transuctions-these speculautions in life and
death-thcse silent battles for reversionary spoil-mako brothers very
loving towvards ench other in Vanity Fuir. I, for my part, have kown
a five-pound-note to intcrpose and kuock up a half century's attaclunecut
etween two brethren; and cun't but dmire, as I think what a fiuc and
lurble thing Love is among worldly pcople.
lt cannot bc supposed thuat the arrival of such a personage as Rebecca
at ucen's Crawley, and ler gradual estublishment in the good graces of
all people there, coull be unremarked by Mrs. Bute Crawley. Ms. Bute,
who knew how many duys the sirloin of beef lnasted ut the Hnll; how
much linen was got ready at the great wash; how many peaches were on
tle south wall; how many doses her lulyship took wvhen she was ill-for
such points are matters of intense interest to certain persons in the
country-MIrs. Bute, I say, could not pass over thce Hull goveress
without making evrery inquiry respecting her history and character. Thcre
wns always the best undcrstanding bctween the servants at the Rectory
and the Hall. There was always a good glass of nale in thc kitclen of tlie
former place for the IIall pcople, whose orlinary drink was very small-
and, indeed, the Rector's lndy knew cxactly how much mnlt went to every
barrel of IIall bcer-tices of relnationship existed between the IIall and
Rectory domestics, as between their masters; and through these channels
each fily was perfectly well acquaintel with the doings of the other.
That, by the way, may be sct down as a general remark. When you and
your brother are friends, his doings are iudifferent to you. When you
ave quarrelled, all his outgoings and incomings you know, as if you
were his spy.
Very soon then after her arrival, Relecca began to take a regular place in
Mrs. Craswley's bulletin from the HIanll. It was to this effect :-``Thc blaek
porker's killed-wcighed  stone-salted the sides-pig's pudding and
leg of pork for dinner. Mr. Crmp, from Mudbury, over with Sir Pitt
ubout putting Joh Blackmore in gnol-Mr. itt at meeting (with ll the
ames of the people who attended)--my lady as usual-the young ladics
with the governess.''
Then the report would come-the new governess be a rnre manager-
Sir Pitt be very sweet on her-Mr, Crawley too--lle be reading trcts to
her-Whnt an abandoned wretch.'' snidl little, eager, active, black-faced
Mrs. Bute Crawley.
86
YANIY 1AIR.
Finally, the reports were that the governess had `'` come round''
everybody, wrote Sir Pitt's letters, did his business, managed his
accounts-hal the upper hand of the whole louse, my lady, MIr. Crasley,
the girls and all-at which Mrs. Crawley declared she was an artful
hussey, and had some dreadful designs in view. Thus te loings at the
Hall were tle great fool for conversation at the Rectory, and MIrs. lBute's
bright eyes spied out ererything that took place in the enemy's camp-
everything and a great deal besides.

the operations of nature: and though hcr parents were disreputable (her
father being a painter, several times bankrupt; and her mother, as I have
since learned, with horror, a dancer at the Opera); yet her talents are con-
siderable, and I cannot regret that I received lcr out of carity. My
dread is, lest the principles of the motler-who was represented to me as
na French Countess, forcel to emigrate in the late revolutionary horrors;
but who, as lIL have since found, was a person of thc eery loest order aud

A NOVEL WITEOT A IER0.
mean the baronet and the rector, not oar brothers-bnt the former, who
hate each other all the year round, beeome quite loving at Christmas. I wrote
to you last year how the abominable horse-rscing rector was in the habit
of preaehing clumsy sermons at us at church, and how Sir Pitt snored in
answer-when Miss Crawley arrives there is no such thing as quarreling
heard of-the Hall visits the Rectory, and sice oerai-the parson and the
baronet talk about the pigs and the poaclers, and the county business,
in the most affable manner, and without quarreling in tleir cups, I believe
-indeed Miss Crawley won't hear of thsir quarreling, and vows that she
will leave her money to the Shropshire Crawleys if they ofend her. If.
they were clever people those Shropshire Crawleys they might have it all,
I think ; but the Shropshire Crley is a clergymn like lis Hampslire
cousin, and mortally offendad Miss Crawley (wlo hnd flel thitler in a fit
of rage against her impracticable brethren) by some strait-laced notions
of morality. HBo would have prayers in the house, I believe.
 Our sermon-books are shut up whan Mss Crawley arrives, and Mr.
Pitt, whom she abominates, finds it eenvenient to go to tow. On the
other hand, the young. dundy, lood, I believa, is the term, Cuptain Craw-
lay makes his appearanee, and I suppose you would like to know wlat
sort of a person he is.
eWell, he is a very larga young nndy. He is six feet high, and
speks with n great voiee; and swears a great leal; and orders about tho
servant, who all adore lim navertheless; for he is very generous of his
money, and the domestios will do anything for him. Last weck the
keepers almost killed n bniliff and his man who came down fromn Lonlon
to arrest tle Captain, and who were found lurkiug about the Park wall-
they beat them, ducked them, and were going to shoot them for poachers,
but the baronet interfered.
 The Captain has a learty cntempt for his father, I can see, and calls
him an old put, an old uol, an old cla-acon, and muberless other
pretty names. He has a dreadfil reputation among the ladies. He
brings his hunters homne with him, lives with the Squires of the county,
nsks whom he pleases to dinner, and Sir lPitt dures not say no, for fear
of offendiug Miss Crawley, andl missing lis legacy when she dies of her
apoplexy. Sall I tell you a compliment the Captain pid mef I must,
it is so pretty. One evening we actually lad a dance; there was Sir
Hndlleston uddleston anl his family, Sir Giles Wapshot and his young
lalies, and I don't know low many more. Well, I heard him say-' By

me the honour to dnnce two country-dnnces with me. He- gets on pretty
gnily with tho young Squires, with whom he drinks, bets, rides and talks

 Here they are. 'Tis the very image of them. Aieu, adieu1''
When Mrs. Bute Crawley (whose artifices our ingenious Rebecca had
so soon discovered) had procured from Miss Sharp the promise of a visit,
she induced the all-powerful Miss Crawley to make the necessary applica-
tion to Sir Pitt, and the good-naturel old lady, who loved to be gay her-
self, and to see eery one gay and happy round about her, wus quite
charmed, and ready to establish a reconcilintion and intimacy between her
two brothers. It was therefore agreed thnt the young people of both

failics sloull visit cach otler frequently for the future, and the friend-
ship of course lasted as long as the jovial old mediatrix was there to keep
the peace.
eWhy did you ask that scoundrel, Rawdou Crawlaey, to dine'' ssid the
Rector to his lady, as they were walking home through the park. Idon't
want the fellow. He looks down upon us country people as so many
blaekamoors. He's never content unless he gets my yellow-sealed wine,
vhich costs me ten shillings a bottle, hang him? Besides, he's such an
infernal character-he 's a gambler-he's a drunkard-he's a profligate
in every way. IIe's killed a man in a duel-he's over heal and ears in
debt, and he's rohbed me and mine of the best part of Miss Crawley's
fortne. Waxy says she has him ''-here the Rector shook his fist ut the
moon, with soethiug very like an oath, and added, in a melancholious
tone-''-, down in hcr will for fifty thousand; and there won't bc aboc
thirty to divide.''
I think she's going,'' said the Rector's wife. `She was very red in
the face when we left dinner. I was obligcd to unlace her.''
`She drank seven glasses of clampagne,'' said the reverend gentleman,
in a low voice; ``und filtly champagne it is, too, that my brother poisons
us with-but you women never know wlat's what.''
Me know nothing,'' said MIrs. Bute Crawley.
``She drank elerry-brandy after dinner,'' continued his Reverence,
'` nnd took curcao with her coffee. I wouln't take a glass for a five-
pound note: it kills me with heart-bumn. She can't stand it, Mrs.
Crawnley-she must go-flesh and blood won't bear itl and I lay five to
two, Mntilda drops in a year.''
Indulging in these solemn speculations, and thinking about his debts,
nd his son Jim at College, and Frank at Woolwvich, and the four girls,
wlo were no beauties, poor things, and would not have a penny but wlat
thcy got from the aunt's expeeted legucy, the Rector and his lady walked
on for a while.
 Pitt can't be such an infemnal villain as to sell tlc reversion of tle
living. And thnt Metholist milksop of an eldest son looks to Pnrliu-
ment,'' continued Mr. Crawley, after a pase.

it's to this man's son-this scoundrcl, gambler, swindler, murderer of
a llawdon Crawley that Mutila leaves the bulk of her money. I say it's
un-Christinn. Dy Jove, it is. The infamous dog has got every vice
cxcept hypocrisy, and that belongs to his brother.''
`Hush, my dearest loel we 're in Sir Pitt's grounds,'' interposed lis

and as for the women, why, you heard that before me, in y own magis-
trates' room--''
``For Heaven's ske, Mr. Crawley,'' said the lady, ``spare me the
details.''
`And you ask this villain into your house l'' continued the exssperated
Rector. `` You, the mother of a young family-the wife of a clergyman of
the Church of England. By Jove1
 Bute Crawley, you are a fool,'' said tle Rector's wife, seornfully.
 Well, Ma'am, fool or not-and I don't sny, Martha, 1'm so clcvcr as
you are, I never did. But I won't meet Rawvdon Crawley, that's fat.
I'll go over to Hudlleston, that I will, and see his black greyhound, MIrs.
Craswley; and I'll run Laneelot against him for fifty. By Jove, I will;
or against any dog in England. But I won't meet that beast Rawdon
Crwley,''
Mr. Crawley, you are intoxsicnted, as usual,'' replied his wife. And
the next morning, when the Ilector woke, and called for small beer, she
put him in miud of his promise to visit. Sir Huddleston Fuddleston, on
aturday, and as he knew he should hare a et niglt, it was ngrecl
that he might gullop back again in time for clrch on Sunday morning.
Thus it will be seen that the parishioners of Crawley were equally happy
in their squire and in their rcctor.
Miss Crawley had not long been established ut the Hall bofore ebecca's
faecinations had wonu the heart of that good-natured London rake, ns they
had of the country iunocents whom we hnve been describing. aking her
accustomed drive, one dny, she thought fit to order that ` that little gover-
ness'' should aecompany her to Mudbury. Before they had returned
Rebecca had made a conqueet of her; having made her luugh four times,
and amused her during the whole of the little journey.
 Not let Miss Sharp dine t tablel'' said she to Sir Pitt, who hnd
arranged a dinner of ceremony, and asked all the neighbouring baronets.
 My dear oreature, do you supposc I can talk about the nursery witl
ILady uddleston, or discuss justices' business with that goose, old Sir
Giles Wapshot? I insist upon Mliss Sharp oppearing. Let Laly Crawley
remain up stairs, if there is no room. But little Miss Sharpl Why,
she 's the only person fit to talk to in the countyl''
Of course, after such a peremptory order as this, Miss Sharp, the
goerness, received commands to dine with the illustrious company bcelow
stairs. And when Sir Huddleston had, with great pomp and cereony,
handed Miss Orawley into dinner, and was prepuring to take his place by
her side, the old lady criel out, in a shrill voice. Beeky Shrp Miss
harpl Coe eu ad sit by me aud amuse me: and let Sir kluddleston
sit by Lady Wapshot.''
When the parties were over, and the carriagcs had rolled away, the insa-
tiable Miss Crawley would say, ``Come to my dressing-room, Beeky, nnd
let ns abuse the company,''-which, between them, this pair of friends
did perfeetly. Old Sir Huddleston wheezed a great deal at dinner; Sir
Giles Wapshot had a particularly noisy mnner of imbibing his soup, and

ler ladyship a wink of the left eye; all of which Becky caricatured to
ahiration; as well as the particulars of the night's conversation; the
politics; the war; the quarter-sessions; the famous run with the H. H.,
and those heavy and dreary themes, about which country gentlemen
converse. As for the Misses Wapshots' toilettes and Lady Fuddleston's
famous yellow hat, Miss Sharp tore them to tatters, to the infinite amuse-
ment of her audience.
 My dear, you are a perfect trouaile,'' Miss Crawley would say. I
ish yon could come to me iu London, but I couldn't make a butt of you
as I do of poor Briggs,-no, no, you little sly creature ; you are too clever
-Isn't she, Firin?''
Mrs. Firkin (who was dressing the rery small rcmnant of hair whioh
remained on Miss Crawley's pate), flung up her head and said, ` I think
Miss i very clever,'' witl the most killing sarcuastic air. In fact, Mrs.
Firkin hnl that natural jealousy which is one of tle main principles of every
honest woman,
After rcbuffing Sir IIuddlcston Fuddleston, Miss Crawley ordered that
Rnwdon Crawlcy should lead her into dinner every duy, and that Becky
should follow with her cushion-or else she would have Becky's arm and
Rawlon with the pillow.  We must sit together,'' she said. : We're
the only three Christians in the county, my love''-in which case, it must
be confessed, that religion was at a very low ebb in the county of Hnnts.
Besides bcing such a fine religiouist, Miss Craley was, as we have said,
nn Ultra-liberal in opinious and always took occasion to express these in
ihe most candid manner.
 What is birth, my dear ?'' she would say to Rebecca-'' Look at my
brother Pitt; look at the Huddlestons, who hae been here since Henry
II., look at poor Bute at the parsonage ;-are any one of them equal to you
in intelligenee or breeding?' Equal to yo-they are not een equal to
poor dear Briggs, my companion, or Bowls, my butler. You, my love,
ure a little paragon-positively a little jewel-ou hae more brains than
hualf thc shire-if merit had its reward, you ought to be a Duchess-no,
there ought to be no duchesses at nll-but you ought to have no superior,
and I consider you, my loe, as my equal in every respect; and-will you
put some coals on the fire, my dear; and will you pick this dress of mine,
aud alter it, you who can do it so well2'' So this old philanthropist used
to ake her equal run of her errands, execute her millinery, and read her to
sleep with French novels, every night.
At this time, as some old readers mny recollect, the genteel world had
een thrown into a considerable state of excitement, by to eents, which,
as the papers say, might give employment to gentlemen of the long robe.
Ensign Shafton hal run away with Lady Barbara Fitzurse, the Earl of
Bruin's daughter and heiress ; and poor Vere Vane, a gentleman who, up
to forty, had maintained a most respectable character and reared a
numerous Iamily, suddenly and outrageously left his home, for the sake of
Mrs. Rougemont, the actress, who was sixty-five years of age.

Miss Crawley snid.  He went to the deuce for a woman. There mst

'And whnt I like next best, is, for a poor fcllow to run away witha

'A rich some one, or a poor some one%''
 Why, you goosel Rawlon has not n shilling but what I give him.

`Is he very clever'' ebecca asked.
 Cleer, my love?-not an idca iu the world beyonl his horscs, and
his regimeut, and his hunting, and his play; but he must succeet-he's
so delightfully wicked. Don't you know he has killed a man, and shot an

all the young men at Wattier's and the Cocoa Tree swcar by him.
WVhen Miss Rebccea Sharp wrote to her beloved friend the account of
the little bnll at uen's Crawley, and the manner in which, for the first
time, Captain Crawley, had distinguished her, she did not, strange to
relate, gie an altogether accurate account of the trunsacetion. The Captain
had distinguishel her a great number of times before. Thce Captain had
met her in a half-score of walks. he Captain hal ligltel upon her ina
half-hundrel of corridors and passages. The Captain had hung over her
piano twenty times of an eening, as (My Lady was now up stairs, being
ill, and nobody heedcd her) she sang. The Captain had written her notes
(the best tht the grcat blundering dragoon could devise and spell; but
dulness gets on as well as any other quuality with women). But when he
put the first of the notes into the lcnves of the song she was singing, the
little goerness, rising and loaoking him stendily in the face, took up the
triangular missive daintily, and waved it about as if it were a cocked hat,
and she, advancing to the enemy popped the note into the fire, aud
made him a very low curtsey, and went back to her place, and begn to
sing away agnin more merrily than ever,
 What's thut?'' said Miss Crawley, interrupted in her after-dinner
loze by the stoppage of the music.
eIt's a false note,'' Miss Sharp said, with a laugh; and Rawdon
Crawley fumed with rage and mortification.
Seeing the evident partiality of Miss Crawley for the new goveruess,
how good it was of Mrs. ute Crawley not to be jealous, and to welcome
the young lady to the Rectory, anl uot only her, but awdon Crawley,
her husband's rival in the Old Maid's five per cents.l They became very

orer to Crawley parsonage-whither Miss Crawley came too; and as their
mamma was ill, why not the children with Miss Sharp? So the children
(little dears ) came with Miss Sharp; and of an evening some of tho party
would walk back together. Not Miss Crawley-she preferred her car-
riage-but the wnlk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little park
wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the cheekered avenue to
ueen's Crawley, was charming in the moonlight to two sucl lovers of
the picturesque as the Captain and Miss Rebecca.
O those stars, those starsl'' Miss Rebecca would say, turning her
twinkling green eyes up towards them. I feel myself almost a spirit
when I guze upon them,''
O-ah-Gad-yes, so do I exactly, Miss Sharp,'' the other enth-
siast replied.  You don't mind my cigar, do you, Miss SharpP'' Miss
Sharp loved the smell of a cigar out of doors beyond everything in the
world-and she just tasted one too, in thc pretticst way possible, and gae
a little puf, und a little scream, and a little giggle, und restored the deli-
cacy to the Captain; who twirled his moustache, and straightway pufed
it into a blaze that glowed quite red in the dark plantation, and swore-
``Jove-aw-CGad-aw-its the fnest segaw I ever smoked in the
world aw,'' for his intellect and conversation were alike brilliant and be-
coming to a heavy young dragoon.
Old Sir Pitt, who was taking his pipe and beer, and tnlking to John
Horrocks about a `` ship'' thnt was to be killed, espied te pair so oeeu-
pied from his study-window, and with dreadful oaths swore thnt if it

E must now take leave of Mrcalia, and
those amiable people practising thc rural
virtues there, und travel baek to London,
to inquire what has become of Miss Mclia.
 We don't care a fig for her,'' writes
some unknown correspondent with a pretty
little hand-writing and n pink seal to her
note. '' She is ,fale and insipid,'' and
adds some more kind remarks in this strain,
which I should never hae repeated at all,
but thnt thcy are in truth prodigiously com-
plimentary to the young lndy whom they
conccrn.
IIas the beloved rcader, in his cxpericnce
of society, ever heard similar rearks by
good-naturcd femnale friends; who always
wonder what you can see in Miss Smith that
is so fascinating; or what could induce Major
Jones to propose for tht silly insignificant
simpering Miss Thompson, who has nothing but her wax-doll fce to
recommend herP What is there in a pair of pink clceks and blue eyes
forsooth ?' these dear Moralists ask, and hint wisely that the giIts of genius,
the accomplishments of the mind, the mastery of Mangnall's questions,
and a ladylike knowledge of botany and geology, the knackof making
poctry, tle power of rattling sonatas in the Herz-manner, and so forth, are
Ifanr more valunble endowments for n femnle, than those fugitive charms
which as few years will inevitably tarnish. It is quite edifying to hear
omen speculate upon the worthlessncss and thc duration of beauly.
But though irtue is a much finer thing, and those haplcss creatures
ho suffer under the misfortune of good looks ought to bc continuully put
in mind of the fate which awaits them; and tlough, very likely, the hcroie
female character which ladies almire is a ore glorious and bcnutiful
object than the kind, fresh, smiling, artless, tendcr little domestic goless,
whom men are inclined to worship-yct the latter and inferior sort of
women must have this consolation-that the men do admire them after all;
nmnd that, in spite of nll our kind friends' warnings and protests, we go on
in our desperato error nnd folly, and shall to the end of the chapter.

for whom I have the greatest respect, that MIiss Brown is an insignificart

YANITY FAIR.
Blk las not a word to say for herself; yet I know that I have hand the
most delightful conversntions with Mrs. HBlaeck (of course, my dear Mndam,
thcy are insiolable): I sce all the men in a cluster round Mrs. White's
chair : all the youung fcllows battling to dancee with MIiss rown: and so
I am tempted to think that to be despised by hcr sex is a very grelt com-
pliment to a woman.
Tlc youug ladics in Amelia's society did tlis for her very satisfaclorily.
TFor instance, tlere was scarcely any point upon wlich the Miss Osbornes,
Gcore's sisters, and the Meslemoisellces Dobbin agreed so well as in their
estiate of her very trifling merits : and tleir wonler that their brothers
could inl any charms in her.  WWe are kind to her,'' the Misses Osborne
said, a pair of fine blaek-browel young ladies who had hnd the best of
governcsses, mastecrs, and milliners; and they treated her with suchl
vxtrcme kidness and condescension, and patronisel her so insufferably,
that the pcr little thing as in fact perlectly dumb in tlcir presence, and
to nll outward appcarance as stupid as they thought her. She madc
eflorts to like the, as in duty bounl, anl as sisters of her future husbnl.
Shc passed ``long mornings'' with them-the most dreary and serious of
forenoons. She drove out solemnly in their great fnmily conch with themn,

frienls, she almost did not dare be affected by the lymn the chillren saug.
Their house was comnufortable; tleir papa's table rich anl handsome ; their

sacrifice he was making, and his romantic generosity in throwing himself
away upon hmelia, that I 'm not sure but that he really thought he was
one of the most deserving characters in thie British urmy, and gave hiuself
up to be loed with a good deal of easy resiguution.
Somehow, although he left ome cvery morning, as was statcd, nnd
dined anbroad six duys in the week, when his sister bclieved the infatuated
yvouth to be at Miss Selcy's apron-strings: e wns ot always witl Amelia,
whilst the world supposed himn at her fcet. Certain it is that on orc
occasions than one, when Captain Dabbin called to look for his fricnd,
MIss Osborne (who was very auttentive to thc Captain, nnd anxious to hcar
his military storics, and to know about the health of his denr MInmna),
Miss Osborne would laughingly point to tle opposite side of thc square,
and say, `` Oh, yon must go to the Sedley's to ask for George; ce never
see hiin from morning till night.'' At which kind of spccch the Cuptain
would laugh in rather an absurd constrained manner, and turn olf the con-
versation, like an consummate mnu of thc world, to some topic of genernl
interest, such as the Opera, the l'rince's lasst ball at Carlton Ilouse, or
the weather-that blessing to society
 What nn innocent it is, that pct of yours,'' Miss Maria would then
sny to Miss Jane, upon the Captaiu's departure. ` Did you see how he

It's a pity Frederic Bulloek hadn't some of his olesty, Miaria,''
replies the eller sister, with a toss of ler lead.

In your froek, he, hel How oould he Wan't he laneing with
Amelina ?'
The fact is, when Captain Dobbin blushel so, anl lookel so awkward,
he remembered a circumstanee of which he did not think it was necessary
to inform the young ladies, viz. tht he had been clling at MIr. Selley's
house already, on the pretenee of seeing George, of course, and George
wasn't there, only poor little Amelia, with ratler a sal wistful face, seatec
uear the drawing-room window, who, after some very trifling stupid talk,
ventured to ask, was there any truth in the repnort that the regiment was
soon to be orlered abroad; anl had Cnptain Dolbin seen Mr. Osborno
that dny 
The regiment was not ordered abroad as yet: ad Cptain Dolbin had
not seen George.  He was with his sister, most likely,'' the Capin sail.
` Should he go and fetch the truant?'' So she gave him her land kindly
and gratefully: nnd he crossed the square; und she waitcl nnd waitel,
but Gcorge never came.
Poor little tender heartl and so it goes on hoping and beating, and
longing and trusting. ou see it is not much of a life to describc. There is
uot much of what you call incident in it. Only one feeling all day-when
will he come? only one thought to sleep and wake upon. I bclievc George
was playing billiards with Cnptain Cunnon in Swallow Strcet ut the tie
when Amelia was nsking Captain Dobbin about him; for he was a jolly
sociable fellow, and excellent in all games of skill.

to- to see her dear friends ; they had not met for so long. And this
lay she was so perfectly stupid and awkward, that the Miss Oabornes
and their governess, who stared after her as she went sadly away, wondered
more than ever what George could see in poor little Amelia.

Of course they did. How was she to bare that timid little heart for
the inspection of those young ladies with their bold black eyes It was
best that it should shrink and hide itsellf. I know the Miss Osbornes

I warrant you the changes did not escnpe the two intelligent young
women before mentionel. But there are things, look you, of n fiuer
texture than fur or satin, nnd all Solomon's glories, and all the wnrdrobe
of the Geen of Sheba ;-things whereof the beauty cscapes the eyes of
uany couoisseurs. And there nre sweet molest little souls on which you
light, fragrant and blooming tenderly in quiet shndy places; nn there
are garden-oruaments, as big s brnss warming-pnns, that are fit to stare
the sun itself out of countenance. Miss Sedley was not of the sun-flower
sort; and I sny it is out of the rules of all proportion to draw a violet of
the size of a double dhlia,
No, indeed; the life of n good young girl who is in the patcrnal nest
as yet, can't have many of tlose thrilling incidents to which the heroine of
romnnce commonly lnys claim. Snnres or shot mny take off the oll birde
foraging without-hawks may be nbroal, from which they cscape or ly
whom they sufler; but the young ones in the nest have a prctty comfortnble
nnromantic sort of existence in the down aud the strnw, till it comes to
their turn, too, to get on the wing. Wlile IMecky Sharp was on her own
wing in the country, hopping ou all sorts of twigs, and amil a multiplieity
of traps, anl pecking up her food quite harmless and suecessful, Amelia
lay sng in her home of Russell Square; if she went into the world, it wns
unlcr the guidance of the celders; nor dil it seem that any cvil could hofal
her or that opulent cheery comfortable home in which she was affection-
ately sheltered. MIamma had her morning dutics, anl her daily drive, and
that delightful round of visits and shopping which forms the nmusemnent,
or the profession as you may call it, of the rich London lady. lapa con-
ducted his mysterious operations in thc city-a stirring place in thosc
days, when war was raging all over urope, and cmpires were bcing
staked; when the `` Courier'' newspaper hul tens of thousnnls of sub-
scribers; when one day brought you n battle of Vittoria, another a burning
of Moscow, or a newsman's horn blowing down usscll Snare about
dinner-time announced such a fact as-'`lattle of ILeipsic-six hundrel
thousand men engaged-total defent of the Frenoh-two hunlred thiousand
killed.'' Old Sedley once or twice came home with a very grave fuce; and
no wonder, when such news as this was agitating all the hearts and all the
Stocks of Europe.
MIeanwhile matters went on in Russell Square, Bloomsbury, just as if
matters in lurope were not in the lecast disorgnnised. The retrent from
Leipsic made no diference in the nuber of meals Mr. Sambo took in thc
servant's hall ; the allies pourel into France, and the dinner-bell rang at
five o'cloek just as usual. Idon't think poor Amelin cared anytling about
Brienne and Montmirail, or was fuairly interestel in the war until the
ablication of the Emperor; when she clapped her hnnls and said prayrs,-
oh, how grateful and flung herself into George Osborne's arms with nll
her sonl, to the nstonishment of every body who witnessel that ebullition
of sentimcnt. The fuct is, peace was leclred, Europe was going to be at
rest; the Corsican was overthrown, and Lieutenant Osborne's regiment
would not be ordered on service. Thnt was the way in which Miss
Anelia reasoued. The fate of Europe was Lieutenant Gdeorge Osborne to

We have talkel of shift, selI, and poverty, as those dismal instructors
under whom poor Miss Beeky Sharp got hcr education. Now, love was
Miss Amelia Sedley's last tutoress, and it was amazing what progress our
young lady made under that popular teacher. In the course of fifteen
or eighteen months' daily and constant attention to this eminent finishing
goerness, what a deal of secrets Amelia lcurunel, which Miss Wirt and the
blacek-eyed young ladies over the way, wlhich old Miss Pinkerton of Chiswick
herself, had no cognizance ofl As, indeed, how shoull any of those prim
and reputable virginsP With Misses P. and WY. the tender possion is out
of the question: I would not dare to breatho such an idea regarding them.
Miss Mnaria Osborne, it is true, was ``attached'' to MIr, Frederic Augustus
Bulloeck, of the firm of Hulker, Bullock, & Bullock; but her's was a most
respectable nttaclment, and she would have taken ulloek fSenior, just the
saine, hcr ind being fixed as that of a well-bred young woman should
be,-upon a house in Park Lane, a country housc at Wimbledon, a hand-
some clariot, and two prodigious tall horses and footmen, and n fourth of
the annual profits of the eminent firm of IIulkr & Bulloek, nll of whieh
atdvantages were represented in the person of Frederic Augustus. Had
orange blossoms bcen invented then (those touching cmblems of femalc
purity imported by us from EFrance, where people's dauglters are univer-
sally sold in arriage), Miss MIaria, I sny, would have assume the spotless
wreath, and stepped into the traelling carriage by the side of gouty, old,
ald-headed, bottle-nosed Bulloek Senior; and devotel hcr beautiful
existcnee to his happiness with perfect modesty,-only the old gcntleman
was married already; so she bestowed hcr young alfections on tho junior
partner. Swcct, bloomning, orange flowers he other day l saw Miss
Trotter (that was), arrayed in thcm, trip into thc travelling curriage at St.
Gcorge's, llanover quare, and lLord Mecthuselah hobblel in after. With
what an cenguging modesty she pulled down the blinds of the chariot-

Tlis was not the sort of love that fiuishel nelin's elucation; and in
the course of n yenr turned a good young girl into a good young womun-
to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come. 1Tlis
young person (perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to encourage
her, and abct her in such idolatry an silly romantie ideas) loved, with all
her heart, the young officer in his Majesty's service with whom we havse
mde a brief uequaintanec. She thought about him the very first moment
on waking; and his was the very last namc mentioned in her prayers.
She never had seen a man so beautiful or so clever: such a figure on

with much success, depend upon it. It is in the nature and instinct of
some womcen. Some are made to scheme, and some to love; and I wish
any rcspectel bachelor that reads this may take the sort thnt bcst likes him.
While under this overpowering impressiou, Miss melia neglected her
twelve dear friends nt Chiswick most cruelly, ns such sellish people com-
only will do. She had but this subject, of course, to think about; aund
Mliss Saltire was too cold for a confidante, and shc coukdu't bring her miud
to tell Mliss Swartz, the woolly-laired young heiress from SBt. Kitt's. She
hul little Laura Mnrtin home for the holiduys; and my beliof is, she
made a confidante of her, and promised that Luura should come and live
with hecr when she was mnrried, and gave Lnura a greut denl of informa-
tion regarling tle passion of loe, which must have bcen singularly useful
nud novel to tht little person. Alas, alas: I fcar she had not n well-
rcgulated riud.
What were her parents doing, not to keep this little heart from bonting
so fast Old Sedley did not seem much to notice matters. Iloe was
graver of late, and his City affairs absorbed him. Mras. Sctley wus of so
easy and uninquisitive a nature, thnt slc wasun't cven jealous. Mr. Jos.
was away, bcing besiged by an Irish widow at Cheltenham. Aelia hal
the house to herself-hl too nucel to herselt somctimcs-not that shc
cver doubted; for, to bc surc, George must b at the IIorsc-(iunrds; and
he can't always get leave from Chatham; and he must see his fricnds and
sisters, and mingle in socicty when in town (he such an oruient to cvery
society ) ; nnd when he is with the regiment, hc is too tired to write long
letters. I know where shc kept thuat packet sho had-and enn stecal in
and out of her chamcr like Iaehimo-like Iahimo? No-that is u bad
part. I will ouly act Moonshine, nnd pceep haruless into the bed where
faith aud beauty and iunocence lie dreaming.
But if Osborne's were short aud soldicrlike letters, it must be confessed,
that were MIiss Sedley's letters to MIr. Osborne to be publisled, we should
hve to extenl this novel to such a multiplicity of volumes as not the most
sentimental reader could support; that shc not only filled sheets of largc
paper, but crossed tlem with thc most nstonishing pervcrsencss; thut she
wrote whole pages out of poetry-books witlout the lcnst pity; that she
underlined words and passages with quite a frantic cmphsis; and, in fine,
gave the usual tokens of her conlition. She wnsn't a hcroine. llcr lctters
eere full of repctition. She wrote rather doubtfl grumar somctimes,
and in her verses took all sorts of liberties with the metre. But oh, mes-

there was that bcnutiful quadroon girl, Miss Pye, at St. Vincent's, you
kuow; and since he 's been home, they say he's as regular Don Giovanni,
y Jove.''
Stubbles nnd Spooney thought tht to be a ``regulr Don Giosanni by
Jove'' was one of the finest qunlities n man could possess; and Osborne's
reputation was prodigious amongst the young men of the regiment. He
was famous in fiveld-snorts, famous at a song, famous on parade; free with
his money, which was bountifully supplied by his father. Iis coats were
bctter made than auy man's in the regiment, and he had more of them.
IIe was adored by the men. He could drink more than any officer of the
whole mess, including old IIeasytop, the colonel. He could spar betlter
than Knuckles, the private (who would have been a corpornal but for hia
drunkcnness, and who had been in the prize-ring); and was the best batter
and bowler, out and out, of the regimental clul. IIe rode his own horse,
Greased Lightning, and won the Garrison cup at uebec rces. There
were other people besides Amclia who woreshipped him. Stubbles and
Spooney thonght him a sort of Apollo ; Dobbin took him to he an Admi-
rahle Crichton ; and Mrs. MIjor O'Dowud acknowlelged he was nn elegnt
young fcllow, nd put her in mind of Fitzjurld Fogurty, Lord Castle-
Iogarty's second son.
Well, Stubhles and Spooney and the rest indulged in most romantic con-
jcetures regarding this female correspondent of Osborne's,-opining that

it was a Duchess in London, who was in love with him,-or that it was
a Geueral's duughter, who wss engged to somebody clse, and mally
attached to him,-or thnt it was as Mlember cf Prlinment's lady, who pro-
posed four horscs and an clopement,-or that it was some other victim
of a passion delightfully exciting, romantic, nud disgraceful to nll pnrtics,
on uone of which conjectures would Osborne throw the lcast light,
leaving lis young almirers and fricnds to invent and arrange thcir whol
istory.
And the real state of the case would never have been known at anll in tha
regiment but for Cnptain Dobbin's indiscretion. IThe Captain was eating
his breakfast one day in the mcss-room, while Cackle, the assistant-surgeon,
and the two abovc-nuamed worthies were specculating upon Osborne's intrigua
-Stubbles holding out that tle ldy was n Duehess nbout ueen Chur-
lotte's conrt, nnl Cackle vowing she was an opera-singer of the worst
reputation. At this idea Dobbin becnme so moved, that though his
mouth was full of egg and bread-and-butter at the time, and though ho
ought not to have spoken at all, yet he couldn't help blurting out, `` Cnckle,
you're a thtupid fool. You 're alwuys talking nonsense and scndal.
Oshorne is not going to run off with a Duchess or ruin a milliner. Mias
Sedley s one ot the most charming young women that ever lived. He'a
been engaged to her ever so long; and the mnn who calls her namces had
better not lo so in my hearing.'' With which, turning exceeingly red,
Dobbin ceased speaking, and almost choked himself witha cup of tea. The
story was over the regiment in half-an-hour; nd that very evening Mrs.
MIajor O'Dowd wrote off to her sister Glorvina at O'bDowdstown not to
urry from Dublin,-young Osborne being prematurely engaged already.
She complimented the Lieutenant in an appropriate spcech over a glass
of whisky-toddy that evening, nnd he went home perfectly furious to
qarrel wvith Dobbin, (who had declinel Mrs. Major O'Dowl's pnrty, nnd
sut in his own room playing the flute, and, I believe, writing poetry in a
very melancholy manner)-to quarrel with Dobbin for betraying his sccret.
 Who the deuce asked you to talk about my affairs,'' Osborue shouted
iudignantly. ``Why the devil is all the regiment to know tht I am goig
to be married Why is thut tattling old harridan, Peggy O'Dowd, to

punch.
The day after the little conversation at Chatham barraeks, young
Osborne, to show that he would be as good as his word, prepared to go
to town, thereby ineurring Captain Dohbin's applause. `I should have
liked to make her a little present,'' Osborne said to his friend in confi-
dence, ``onl I am quite out of cash until my father tips up.'' But
Dobbin wonld not allow this good nature and generosity to be balked, and
. so accommodated Mr. Osborne with a few pound notes, wlich tle latter
took after a little faint seruple.
And I dare say he would have bought something ery handsome for
Amelia; ohly, getting off the coach in Fleet Street, he was attracted by a
handsome shirt-pin in a jeweller's window, which he could not resist; and
having paid for that, hud very little money to spare for indulging in any
further exercise of kindness. Never mind: you may be sure it ws not his
presents Amelia wanted. Wen he came to Russell Square, her iace
ighted up as if he had been sunshine. The little cares, fears, tears, timid
misgivings, sleepless fancies of I don't know how many lays and nights,
were forgotten, under one momnt's influence of that familiar, irresistible

Cnptain Osbin (having conferred a brevet rank on that young officer)

imp up from her watching-place in the window; and Snmbo rctreated:
and as soon as the door was shut, she went fluttering to Licutenant George
Osborne's hcart as if it was thce only natural home for her to nestle in.
Oh, thou poor panting little soul The very finest trce in the whole
forest, with the straightest stem, and the strongest arms, and the thickest
foliage, wherein you choose to build and coo, may be narked, for whnt
you know, and may be down with a crash ere long. WVhat nn old, old
simile thnt is, betwecn man and timber l
In the meanwlile, ieorge kissed her very kindly on her forehead and
glisteuing eyes, anl was very gracios and good; and she tought Iis
diamond shirt-pin (whieh she hal not known him to wear before) the pret-
tiest ornament ever seen.
The observant reader, who has marked our young Lieutennnt's previous
behaviour, and has preserved our report of the brief conversation which he
has just had wilh Captain Dobbin, hus possibly come to certain conclu-
sions regarding the character of Mr. Osborne. Some cynical Frenchman
has snid that there are two parties to a love-transaction: the one who loves
aud the other who condcescends to be so treated. Perhapns the loe is
oeeasionally on the man's side: perhups on the lady's. Perhaps some
infatuated swain has ere tlis mistaken insensibility for modesty, dullness
for maiden-reserve, mere vacuity for sweet bashfulness, and a goose, in n
wod, for a swan. Perhaps some bcloved female subscriber has arrayed an
ass in the splendour and glory of her imagination ; admired his dullness
as manly simplicity; worshipped his selfishness ns manly superiority;
treated his stupidity as majestic graity, and used him as the brilliant
fairy Titania id a certain weaver of Athcns. I think I hve seen such
comedies of errors going on in the world. But this is certain, that Amelia
believel her lover to be one of the most gallant and brillinnt men in tle
empire: and it is possible Licutenant Osborne thought so too.
He was n little will: how many young men are; aud do't girls like
a rake better than a milksop He hadn't sown his wild oats as yet, but
he would soon: anl quit tho army, now that peace was proclainied; thc
Corsican mouster locked up at Elba; promotion by conscquence over; nnd
no chnce lcft for thc display of his undoubted military talents anl vulour:
and his allowance, with MAmelian's settlement, would enable themn to tuke a
snug place in the country somewhere, in a good sporting neighbourhood;
nl he would hunt a little, and farm n littlc; nl they would bc very
happy. As for remaining in the nrmy as a marricd man, that was impos-
sible. Fnny Mrs. George Oshorne iu lodgings in a country town;
or, worse still, in the East or West Indies, with a society of ollicers,
and patronizel by MIrs. Major O'Dowd: Amelia diel with laughing at
Osborne's stories about MIrs. Major O'Dowl. IIe loel her mch to
fondly to subjcct hcr to tht horrid womanu nnd her vulgaritics, and the
rough treatment of a sollier's wile. 1le didu't care for himself-not he;

A NOEL WITEOUT A HERO.

but his desr little girl should take the place in society to which as his wifa
she was entitled: and to these proposals you may be sure she acceded, as
she would to any other from the same author.
Holding this kind of onersation, and building numberless castles in
the air (which Amelia adorned with all sorts of flower-gurdens, rustic
walks, country churches, sunday schools, and the like; while George had
his mind's eye directed to the stables, the kennel, and the cellar), this
young pair passed away a couple of hours very pleasantly; and as the
Lieutenant hnd only that single day in town, and a great deal of most
important business to transact, it was proposed that Miss Emmy should
line with her future sisters-in-law. This iuvitation was acccpted joyfully.
Ie conducted her to his sisters; wvhere he lcft hcr talking and prattling in
a way that astomished those ladics, who thought that George might make
something of her; and then went off to transuct his business.
In a word, hewent ou anl at ics at a pastry-cook's shop in Charing
Cross; trieraew coat in-Pall Mall; dropped in at thc Old 9lughters',
and callel.for Captain Canno played cleven games at billiards with the
Captain, of which he won eight,and returned to Russell Squsre half-an-
hour late for dinner, but in very good humour.
It was npot so with old Mr. Osborne. Wen that gentleman came from
the city, anl was welcomed in the drawing-room by his daughters and the
elegant Miss Wirt, they saw at once 'hy his face-which was puffy, solemn,
nd yellaw at the best of times-and by the scowl and twitching of his
black eye-brows, that the henrt within his large white wuistcoat was
disturbed and uneasy.  When Amelia stepped forward to salute him,
which she' always did with great trembling and timidity, he gaven
surly grunt of recognition, and dropped the little hand out of his great
hirsute paw without any attempt: to hold it there. Ile looked round
gloomily at his cldest daughter; who, comprehending thc menning of his
look, which asked unmistakeahly,  Why thc devil is ale here ?'' said at
0nCe:-
 George is in town, Papa; and has gone to the Horse Guards, and
will be back to dinner,''
O he is, is het I won't hasre the dinner kept waiting for linn,
Jane :'' with which this worthy man lapsed into his particular chair, and
then the utter silence in his genteel, well-lurnished drawing-room, wns
only interruptel by the alarmed ticking of the great Frencl clock.
When that chronometer, which was surmounted by a cheerful brass
roun of the saerifice of Iphigenia, tolled five in a hey cathedral tone,
Mr. Osborne pulled the bell at his right hand violently, and the butlen
rushel up.
 Dinnel'' roared Mr. Osborne.
eMr. George isn't come in, sir,'' interposed the man.
Damn Mr. George, sir. Am I master of the house DrEnI''
Mr. Osborne scowled. Amelia trembled. A telegraphic comnunication
of cyes passed between the other three ladies. The obcdient bell in tl
lower regions began ringing the annouucement of the menl. The tolling

his great blue coat and brass buttons, an witlhout waiting for a further
announcement, strode down stairs alone, scowling over his shoulder at the
four femules.
 What 's the matter now, my dear ?'' asked one of the other, as they
rose and tripped gingerly bcehind the sire.
I suppose the funds are flling,'' whispered Miss Wirt; nnd so,
trembling nnd in silence, this hushed female company followed their durk
lealer. They took their places in silence. e growled out a blessing,
which sounded as grufly as n curse. The great silver dish-covers were
removed. Amelia tremblel in her place, for she was next to the awful
Osborne, and alone on her side of the table,-the gap eiug occasioned y
the absence of Gcorge.
Soup'' sys Mr. Oborne, clutching the ldle, fiing his eyes on her,
in a sepulchral tone; and having helped her and the rest, did not speak for
a while.
 Take Miss Sedley's plate away,'' at Inst he said. :She cnn't eat the
soup-no more can I. It's beastly. Take away the soup, IIicks, and
to-morrow turn the cook out of the honse, Jane,''
Hning coneluded his observations upon the soup, MIr Osborne made a
few curt remarks respecting the fish, also of a savage and satiricnl ten-
dency, and cursed Billingsgate with an emphasis quito worthy of the
place. Then,he lapsed iunto silence, anud swallowed sundry glasses of wine,
looking more aud more terrible, till a brisk knock at the door told of
George's arrival, when everyody began to rally.
He could not coe before. General Daguilet had kept him waiting at
the Horse Guards. Never mind soup or fish. Give him anything-he
didu't care what. Capital mutton-cnpital ererything.'' His good-
humour contrasted with his father's severity; and he rattled on unceas-
ingly during dinner, to the dcliglt of all-of one especially, who need not
be mentioned.
As soon as the young ladies had discttssed the orange and the glass of
wine which formel the ordinary conclusion of the dismal banquets at Mr.
Osborne's house, the sigal to make sail for the drawing-room was given,
and they all arose and departed. Aelia hoped George woull soon join
them there. She began playing some of his fuvourite waltzcs (then newsly
inported) at ths gret carved-leggel, leather-cased grand piano in thc
lrawsing-room overhead. This little artifice did not bring himn. Ie was
denf to the waltzes; they grew faintcr and fainter ; the discomfited per-
former left the huge instrument prcsently; and though her three friends
performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new pieces of their reer-
toire, she did not hear a single note, but sate tlinking, nnl boding evil.
Oll Osborne's scowl, terrifie always, had never bfore looked so leadly to
her. IIis eyes followed her ont of the room, as if she had been guilty of
something. WYhen they brought her coffee, she started as though it were
n cup of poison whieh Mr. Iieks, the butler, wished to propose to her. What
mystery wns there lurking? Oh tlose womenl They nurse and cuddle
their presentiments, and muke darlings of their ugliest thoughts, as they do
of their deformed children.

bilious, how was hc to extract thut oney from the govemuor, of which
George was consumnedly in want Ile began praising his futher's wine.
Ihat was generally a successful means of cajoling the old gentleman.
We never got sueh Mlaleira in the West Inies, sir, as yours. Colonel
lIeavytop took off tlree bottlcs of that you sent me dow, under his belt
the other dny.''
Dil he:'' said the old gentleman. `'It stands me in eight sillings
a bottle,''
 Will yon take six guineas a dozen for it, sir'' said Guorge, witha
laugh. : There 's one of the greatest men in the kingdo wauts some.''
Does he:'' growled the senior.  Wih he may get it.''
WYhen General aguilet was at Chatham, sir, Ileavytop gave lim n
breakfast, and asked me for some of the wine. The Gencral likel it just
s well-wanted s pipe for tha Commnler-in-Chief. IIe's his loyl
lIighness's right-hand man.''
It is devilish fine wine,'' said the Eycbrows, and tlcy lookcd ore
good-lmoured; nnd George was going to take advantagc of tlis com-
placencey, and bring the supply question on the mahogauy; whcn the
father, relapsing into solemnity, though rather cordial in maner, bale him
riug the bell for clret. ``And we 'l see if tlut 's as good as the Maleira,
George, to which his Royal IIighmness is weleomc, l 'm sure. And ns wc
are drinking it, I'll talk to you alout a matter of importance.''
Amelia heard the claret bell ringing as she snt nervously u-stuirs. Shc
thought, somehow, it was a mysterious anl prcsentimental bcll. Of the
presentiments which some people are always having, aome surely must
come right.
 What I want to know, George,'' the old gentleman snid, aflter lowly
smacking his first bumper.  What I wnut to know is, how you nnd-
ah-that little thing up-stirs, aure carrying onP''
I think, sir, it 's not hard to see,'' teorge said, with n self-satisfiel
grin.  Pretty clear, sir.-What cnpital wine''
 WVhat d' you menn, pretty clear, sir''
 Why, hangit, sir, don't push me too hard. I 'm a molest man. I-
ah-I don't set up to be a lady-killer; but I do own that she 's as devilish
fond of me as she can be. Any body can see that witl lalf an eye.''
``And you yourself2''
 Why, sir, didn't you orler me to marry her, nnl ain't I a good boy '

`A pretty boy, indeed. IInvhn't I henrd of your doings, sir, with
Lord Tarquin, Cuptain Crawley of the Guards, the Honorable Mr., Deuceace
and tlat set. Have a care, sir, have a care.''
The old gcntleman pronounced thcse aristocratic uames witl the
greatcst gusto. Whenever he met a great man he grovclled before him,
and m-lorded him as only a free-boru Briton can do. HIIe came home
and lookel out his history in the Peerage: he introducel his name into his
dily conversation; he bragged ahout his Lorlship to his dnghters. He
fell down prostrate and bnasked in him as a Nenpelitan beggar does in the
sun. George wns alarmed when he heard the names. IIe fearel his

father might have bcen informed of certaiu transactions at play. But the
old moralist cased him by saying serenely,

 Thank you, sir,'' snys Gcorge, making his point at once. ' One cnn't

and he held up n little token which hnd been netted by Amelin, and con-
tainel the very last of Dobbin's pound notes.
 You shan't want, sir. The British merchant's son shan't want, sir.
My guineas are as good as theirs George, my boy; and I dont grudge
'em. Call on Mr. Chopper as you go through the City to-morrow; he'll
have something for you. I dont grudge money when I know you 're in
good society, because I know that good society can never go wrong.
There's no pride in me. I was a humbly born man-but you have had
uivntages. Mnke a good use of 'cm. Mixr with the young nobility.

Only there's one thing I order you to avoid, which, if you do not, 1'll
cut you off with a shilling, by Joe; and that's gambling, sir.''
`Oh, of course, sir,'' said George.
But to return to the other business about Amelia: why shonlln't you
arry higher tlan a stockbroker's daughter, George-that's what I want
to know 
 It 's a fnmily business, sir,'' says George, crascking filberts. `You and
MIrF. Sedley made the match a hundred years ago,''
I don't deny it; but people's positions alter, sir. I don't deny that
Sedley madce my fortune, or rather put me in the way of acquiring, by y
own taleuts and genius, that proud position, which, I my say, I occupy in
thce tallow trade and the City of London. I've showmn my gratitude to
Selley; and he's tried it of late, sir, as my check-book can show.
Gcorgel I tcll you in confilence I don't like the looks of Ir. Seclley's

he's an old file, and knows Change as well as nny man in London.

by the Yankee Privateer Molasses. And that 's flat,-unless I see Amelia's

WWith wlich Mr. Osborne spreal out the cveniug-ppcr, nnd Gcorgc
knew from this signal that the colloquy was ended, and that his apa was
ubout to take a nap.
IIce hurried up stairs to Amelia in the highest spirits. WYhat was it
that made him more attentive to her on that night than he had been for n
long time-more eager to amuse her, more tcnuder, more brilliant in talk?

attitude, as he leant oer her or looked at her from a distance. As it
seemed to her, no night ever passed aso quickly at Mr. Osborne's house
before; and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry
by the premature arrival of Mr. Sambo with her shawl.
George came and took a tender lesve of her the next morning: anl
then hurried off to the City, where he visited Mr. Chopper, his father's
head man, and received from that gentleman a doeument which he ex-
changed at Hulker's and Bullock's for a whole poeket-full of money. As
George entered the house, old John Sedley ws passing out of the banker's

MIsS CRAWLEY AT IIOYIE.
[
BOUT this time there rove up to an
exceedingly snug and well appointel
housc in Park Lane, a travelling chariot
with a lozenge on tle panels, a dis-
contented female in a green veil and
crimped curls on the rumble, and a
large and confidential man on the box.
It was the equipage of our friend Miss
Crawley, returning from Hants. The
windows of the carriage were sht;
the fat spaniel, whosc head and tongue
ordinarily lolled out of one of them,
reposel on the lnp of the discontented
female. WYhen the vehicle stopped, na large round bundle of shawls was taken
out of the carriage by thc aid of various domcstics and a young lady who
acecompanied the hcap of cloaks. That bunlle contained Miss Crawley,
who was conveyed up-stairs forthwith, and put into a bed and chamber
warmed properly as for the reception of an invalid. Messengers went off
for her physician and medical man. They came, consulted, prcescribel,
vanishced. The yog companion of Miss Crawley, nt the conclusion of
their interview, came in to receive their iustructions, and administered
those antiphlogistic medicincs which the emincnt men ordered.
Captain Crasley of tlc Litfe Gurds rode up fromn Knightsbridge Bar-
raeks thc next day: his black charger pawed the straw before his invalid
nunt's door. IIe was most nffecctionate in his inquiries regarding that
amiable relative. There seemed to be mueh source of apprehension. IIe
found Miss Crawley's mid (the discontented femule) unusually sulky and
despondent : he found Miss Briggs her dame dc compagnie in tears alone in
the drawing-room. She had hastened home, caring of her belovel friend's
illness. She wished to fly to her couch, that couch which she, Briggs, had
so often smoothed in the hour of sickness. She was denied ndmission to
Miss Crasley's apartment. A stranger was ndministering her medicines
-a stranger from the country-an otdious MIiss . . . tears choked the
utterance of the dame dce compngnie, and sle buried her crushed affections
and hcr poor old red nose in hcr pockct handkerchief.
awdon Crawley sent up his name by the sulky femmc de chamle, anl
Miss Crawley's new compunion, coming tripping down from tlue sick-
room, put a little hnd into his as he stceppcd forward eagcrly to meet her,
gave a glauce of great scorn at the bewildered Briggs, and, beckouing tha
young Guardsman out of the back drawing-room, led himn down stairs inta
that now desolate dining-parlour, wlcre so many a good dincr had bcen
celcbrated.
A NOLL IITI0CI A HIEI.
11
IIere thcse two talked for ten minutes, discussing, no donbt, the symp-
toms of the old invalid above stairs; at the end of which period the
parlour-bell was rung briskly, and answered on that instant by Mr. Bowls,
Miss Crawley's large confidential butler (who, indced, happened to be nt
the keyhole during the most pnrt of the interview); and the Captain coming
out, curling his moustachios, mounted the black charger pwing among
the straw to the admiration of the little blackguard boys collccted in the
street. Ie looked in nt the dining-room window, managing his horse,
which curvetted and capercd beautifully-for one instant the young person
might be scen at the window, then her figure vanished, and, doubtless, she
went-up stairs again to resume the affceting dutics of benevolence.
Who could this young womn be, I wonderP Tlat evening a iittlo
linner for to persons wns laid in the dining-room-when Mrs. Firkin,
the lady's naid, pushed into her mistress's npartment, nnd bustlel alout
tcre during the vacancy occasioned by thec departure of the new nurse-
nnd the latter and Miss Briggs sat dowrn to theneat little meal.
Briggs was so much choked by emotion tht she could hardly tke n
morsel of ment. Thc young person carved n fol with the utmost
lelicacy, and nsked so distinctly for egg-sauce, that poor Briggs, before
whom that lelicious condiment wns plnced, started, mnde a great clatter-
ing with the ladle, and once more fell bnck in the most gusling hysterical
state.
Hal you not better give Miss Briggs a glass of wvine2'' anid thc
person to Mr. Bowls, the lnrge confidentinl man. IIe did so. Briggs
seized it mechanically, gaspet it down convulsively, moaned a little, and
began to play with the chicken on her plate.
t I think we shall be able to help cach other,'' snid the person with
reat suavity: ``and shall have no ncedl of Mr. Bols's kindl services.
MIr. Bowls, if you please, we will ring when wc want you.'' He went
don stairs, where, by the way, he vented the most horrid curses upon
the unoffending footman, his subordinate.
It is a pity you take on so, Miss Briggs,'' the young laly said, witha
cool, slightly srcastic, air.
 My derest friend is so ill, and wo-o-o-on't sce me,'' gurglcd
out Briggs in an agony of rencwed grief.
She's not very ill any more. Console yourself, lenr MIiss Iriggs.
She has only overeaten herself-that is all. She is greatly better. he
will soon be quite restored ngain. She is wesk from beiug cuppcd and
from medical treatment, but she will rally immeliatcly. Prny console
yourself, nnd tnke a little miore wino.''
e ut why, why won't she see me again?'' Miss Briggs blcnted out
Oh, Matilda, Mfatilda, after three-nnd-twenty ycars' tendernessl is this
the return to your poor, poor Arabella?''
Don't cry too much, poor Arabella,'' the other said (with ever so
little of a grin);'' she only won't sce you, bccause she says you don't nurse
her as well as I do. It's no pleasure to me to sit up anll night. I wish
you might do it instcnd.''
 IHave I not tended that ear couch for years:'' Arabella said, `` and
o-L''
2
116
VANIFY AIB.
 Now she prefers someody else. Well, sick people have these fancies,
and must be humoured. When she's well I shall go.''
eNever, never,'' Arabella exclaimed, madly inhaling her salts-bottle. .-
Never be well or never go? Miss Briggs,'' the other said, with the
same provoking good nuature. ``Pooh-she will be well in a fortnight,
when I shall go baek to y little pupils at Gueen's Crawley, and to thein
mother, who is a great deal more sick than our friend. ou need not be
jealous about me, my dear Miss Briggs. I am a poor little girl without
nny friends, or any harm in me. I don't want to supplnt you in Miss
Crawley's good graces. Sle will forget me a week nfter I am gone: and
her affeetion for you has been the work of years. Give me a little winc
if you plese, my dear Miss Briggs, and let us be friends. I 'm sure I
want friends.''
The placable nd soft-hearted Briggs speechlessly pushed out her hand
at this appeal; but she felt the desertion most keenly for all tlat, and
bitterly, bitterly moanel the fickleness of her Matilda. At the end of
half an hour, the meal over, Miss Rebeeca Sharp (for such, astonishing to
atate, is the name of her who has been described ingeniously as the person
hitherto), went up-stairs again to her patient's rooms, from which, with
the most engging politeness, she eliminated poor Firkin.  Thank you,
Mrs. Firkin, thnt will quite do: how nicely you make it1 I will ring
when anything is wanted.''  Thank you;'' and Firkin came down stairs
in a tepest of jealousy, only the more dangerous because she was forcel
to confine it in her own bosom.

A NOYEL WITIOCT A HERO.
I
Rebecca passel that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawley; the
next night the old lady slept so comfartably, that Rebeccn had time for
several hours' comfortable repose herself on tle sofa, at the foot of her
patroness's bed; very soonu, Miss Crwley was so well that she sat up
and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Briggs and ler griel,
which HRebecca described to her. lriggs' weeping anuffle, and her manner
of using the handkerchief, were so copletely renlered, thlat Miss Crawley
ecae quite cheerful, to the admiration of the doctors wlen they visitel
her, who usually found this worthy woman of the world, wlen the lenst
sickness attacked her, under the most abject depression anl terror of death.
Captain Crwley came every dsy, and received bulletins from Miss
Rebecea respeeting his aunt's health. Tlis improved so rapidly, that
poor bBriggs was allowed to see her patronuess; and persons with tender
hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female,
anl the affectiug nature of the interview.
Miss Crawley liked to have Briggs in a good deal soon. Rcbccca used
to miic her to her face with tle most ndmirable grvity, thercby ren-
dering the imitation doubly picunnte to her worthy patroness.
The causes wlich had led to the leplorable illness of Miss Crawley, and
her departure from her brotler's house in the country, were of such an
unroantic nature tat tley are harlly fit to be cxplained in this genteel
and sentimental novel. For how is it possible to hint of n delicnte female,
living in good society, that she ate and drank too much, and that n hot
supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the ectory was the rcason of an
iudisposition which Miss Crwley herself persistel ws solely attributable
to the dampness of tle weather? The attacek was so sharp tht Mntilda-
ns his Reverence expressed it-ws very nearly `` off the hooks;'' all the
family was in a fever of expectation regarding the will, and Rawdon
Craley was making sure of at lenst forty thousand pouuds before the
commeucement of the London season. Mr, Crawley sent ovcr a choicc
parcel of tracts, to prepare her for the change from Yanity Fnir and Park
Lane for another world; but a good doctor from Southampton being
called in in time, vanquished the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her,
nud gave her sufficiecnt strength to enuble her to return to London. The
barouet did not disguise his excecding mortification at the turn whieh
aflairs took.
While everybody was attending on Miss Crawley, and messengers every
hour from the llectory were carrying uews of her health to the nflectionatc
folks thiere, there was a lady in auother part of the house, being exceedingly
ill, of whom no one took any notice at all; and this was thc lady ol
Crwley herself. The good doctor shook his heal after secing hcr; to
wlich visit Sir Pitt consented, as it eould be paid without a fee; and she
was left. fading away in her lonely chamber, with no more heed paid to her
thnn to n weed in the park.
The young ladies, too, lost much of the iuestiable benefit of their
governess's instruction. So affectionate n nurse was Miss Sharp, that
Miss Crawley would take her melicines from no other hand. Firkin ha
been deposed long before her ristress's departure from the country. ThaI

Iaithful attenlant found a gloomy consolation on retuuing to London, in
seeing Miss lriggs suffer the same pangs of jelousy and undergo the same
fithless treatment to which she herself hnd been subject.
Captain Rawdon got an extension of leave on his aunt's illnese, and
remuined dutifully at home. Ie was always iu her antichamber. (She lay
siek in the state bed-room, into which you entered by the little blue saloou).
His father was always mecting him there; or if he came down the corridor
ever so quietly, his fnther's door was sure to open, and the lyana face of
the old gentleman to glare out. What wns it set one to watch the othet
so P A generous rivalry, no doubt, as to which should be most attentivc
to the dear suferer in the state bed-room. Rebeeca used to come out
and comfort both of tlem; or one or the other of them rather. Both of
these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to have news of the invalid
from her little confilential messenger.
At dinner-to which meal she descended for hulf an hour-she kept the
peace betwecn them: after which she disappeared for the night; when
Rawdon woull ride over to the dep0t of tho 150th at Mulbury, leaving
his Papa to the society of Mr, Horrocks and his rum and water. She
puassed as weary n fortnight as ever mortal spent in Miss Crawley's sick
room; but her little nerves seemed to be of iron, and she was quite
unshaken by the duty and the telium of the sick-chamber.
She never told until long afterwards how painful thnt duty was; how
peevish a patient was the jovial old luady ; how angry; how sleepless; in
what horrors of deatl; during what long nights she lay moaning, and in
almost delirious agonies rcspecting tlat future world which she quite
ignored when she was in good health,-Picture to yourself, oh fair young
reader, a worldly, selfish, graceless, thaukless, religionless old woman,
writling in pain and fear, and without her wig. Picture her to yourself,
and ere you be old, learn to loe and pray
Sharp watlched this graeeless edside with indomitable patience. Nothing
escaped her; and, like a prudent steward, she found a use for everything.
She told many a good astory about Miss Crawley's illness in after dnys,-
stories hich made thce lady blush through her artificial carnations. During
the illness she was never out of temper; always alert; she slept light,
having a perfeetly clear conscienee; and could take that refreshment at
almost any minute's wamning. And so you saw few traces of fatigue in
her appcarance. Her face might be a trifle pler, and the circles round
her eyes a little blacker than usual; but whenever she cnme out from the
sick-room she was always smiling, fresh, and neat, and looked as trim in
her little dressing-gown and cap, as in her smartest evening suit.
The Captain thought eo, and raved about her in uncouth convulsions.
The barbed shaft of love hnd penetrated his dull hide. Six weeks-appro-
pinquity-opportunity-had victimised him completely. He made a con-
fidunte of his aunt nt the Rectory, of all persons in the world. She rallied
him about it; she had perceived his folly ; she warned him; she finished
by owning that little Sharp was the most clever, droll, odd, good-natured,
simple, kindly creature in England. Rawdon must not trille with her
nafections, tlough-denr Miss Crawley would never pardon him for that;
for she, too, was quite overcome by the little governess, and loved Slarp

like n daughter. Rawdon must go away-go back to his regiment and
naughty London, and not play with a poor nartless girl's feelings.
MInny and many ntime this good-natured ludy, compassionating the for-
iorn life-gurdsman's conlition, gave him an opportunity of seeing Miss
Sharp at the Rectory, and of walking home with her, as we have seeu.
WWhen men of a certaiu sort, ladies, are in love, though they seo the hook
and the string, and the whole apparatus with whicl they nre to be take,
they gorge the bnait nevertheless-they must come to it-they must swnllow
it-and are presently struck and landed gasping. llawdon saw there was
a manifest intention on Mrs. Butc's part to captivate him with Ilcbecca.
He was not very wise; but he was a man about town, nnd had seen
several seasons. A light dawnel upon his dusky soul, as he tlought,
through a speech of Mrs Bute's.
Mark my words, llawdon,'' she said.  You will have MIiss Shar

 You men perceive nothing. ou silly, blind crenture-if anything
happens to Lady Crawley, Miss Slarp will be your mother-in-law; and
tlat 's whut will lappen.''
Iawlon Crawley, Esquire, gae vent to a prodigious whistle, in token of
astonishment at this announcement. He couldn't deny it. IIis father's
evident liking for Miss Sharp had not scaped him. IIe kncw the old
gentleman's character well; and a more unscrupulous old-whyou-he did
not conclude thc sentence, but walked home, curling his moustachios, and
convinced he had found a clue to Mrs. Bute's mystery.
 By Jove, it's toao bad,'' thought Hawdon, '`too bad, by Jovel I da

When he snw Rebeeca alone, he rallied her about his father's attaclment

she spoke with ever so slight a foreign accent, wlicl gave agreat charm tao
her clear ringing voice. ` No,'' she continued, kindling as she spoke to
the Captain; ``l can eudure poverty, but not shame-negleet, but not

Her feelings gave way, and she burst into tears.
` Hang it, Miss Sharp-llebecca-by Jove-upon my soul, I wouldn't

She was gone. She drove out with Miss Crawley thst dy. It was
before the latter's illness. At dinner sle was unusually brilliant anl
lively; but she would take no notice of the hints, or the nods, or the
clumsy expostulations of the humiliated, infatuated guardsman. Skir-
mishes of this sort passsed perpetually during the little campaign-tedious
to relate, and similar in result. The Crawley heavy cavalry was maddened
by defeat, and routed every day.
Ifthe baronet of ueen's Crawley had not had the fear of losing his sister's
legacy before his eyes, he never would have permitted his dear girls to
lose the educational blessings wlich their invaluable governess was con-
ferring upon them. The old house at home seemed n desert without her,
so useful and pleasant had Relecca made herself there. Sir Pitt's letters
were not copied and corrected; his books not mnde up; his household
business and manifold schemes neglected, now that his little secretary was
away. And it was casy to see how necessary such an amanuensis was to
him, y the tenor nnl spelling of the numerous letters which he sent to
her, entreating her and commanding her to return. Almost evcry day
brought n frank from the baronet, enclosing the most urgent prnyers to
Becky for her rcturn, or conveying puthetie statements to Miss Crawley,
regarding the neglected state of his daughters' elucation; of whicl docu-
ments Miss Crawley took very little heed.
Miss bBriggs was not formally dismissed, but her placec as companion
was a sinecure and a derision ; and her compay was thc fat spaniel in the
drawing-room, or ocensionally the discontented Firkin in the housekeepcr's
closet. Nor, tlough the old ludy would by no means hear of Rebeecn's
departure, was the latter regularly installed in oltice in Park Lane. Like
many wealthy peoplc, it ws Miss Crawley's hubhit to accept as much
service ans she could get from her inferiors; and good-naturedly to tanke
lcae of them when she no longer found them useful. Gratitude amongst
certain rieh folks ie scarcely natural or to be thought of. They take
needy people's services as their due. Nor have you, O poor parasite and
humble hanger-on, much reason to conplain! our friendship for Dives

Ad I am not sure, that, in spite of Rebecca's simplicity and activity,
and gentleness anl untiring good humour, the shrewd oll London lady,
upon whom thesc treasures of fricenlship were lavished, had not a lurking
uspicion nll the while of ler affectionate nure and friend. It must he

If she measured her own feeling towards the world, she must hne been
pretty well nble to gauge those of the world towards herself; and perhaps
she reflected, that it is the ordinary lot of people to have no friends if thsy
themselves care for nobody.
Well, meanwlile Becky was the grentest comfort and conveniencee ta
her, and she gave her a couple of new gowns, and an old necklaee asd
shawl, and shewed her friendship by abusing all her intimate ncquaintanees
to her new confidante (than which there cnn't be a more touching proof of
regard), and meditated vaguely some great future benefit-to marry her
perhas to Clump, the apothecary, or to settle her in some advantageous
way of life; or, at any rate, to send her back to Gueen's Crawley wlen she
had done with her, and the full London season had begun.
When Miss Crawley was convalescent and descended to the drawing-
room, Becky sang to her, and otherwise amused her; when she was
well enough to drive out, lBecky accompanied her. And amongst the
drives which they took, whither, of all places in the worll, did Miss
Crawley's admirble good-nature and friendship actually induce her to
penetrate, but to Russell Squnre, Bloomsbury, and the house of Joh
edley, Esquire.
Ere that cvent, many notes had passed, as may be imagined, between
the two dear frienls. During the months of ebecca's stay in Hnmshire,
the eternal friendship lad (must it be owned) suffered considerable
diminution, and grown so decrepit nnd feeble with old age as to threaten
demise altogether. The facet is, both girls had their own real aflairs tn
think of: llebecca her ndvnnce with hcr employers-Amelia her ow
absorbing topic. When the two girls met, and flew into each other's ans
with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of young ladics
towards each other, Rebecca pcrformed her part of the emnbrace with thc
most perfect briskness and energy. Poor little Amelia blushed as shc
kissed her friend, and thought she hud bcen guilty of something very like
coldness towards her.
Their first interview was but a very short one. Amelia was just ready
to go out for a walk. Miss Crwley was wniting in her carriage below,
her people wondering at the locality in which they found theselves, and
garing upon honest Sambo, the black footman of Bloomsbury, as one of
the queer natives of the plaee. But when Mmelia came down with her
kind smiling looks (ebecca must introduce her to her friend, Miss Crawley
was longing to see her, and was too ill to leave her carriage)-when, I sa,
Amelia cnme down, the Park Lne shoulder-knot aristocracy wondered
more and more that such n thing could come out of Bloomnsbury; and
MIiss Crawley was fairly captivated by the swcet blushing face of the young
lady who came forwurd so timidly and so gracefully to pay her respects to
the protector of her friend.

said, as they drove away westward after the little interview. ``My dcar

Of course, on this Rlebecca instantly stated, that Amelia was engaged to

Miss Slarp told Crnwley the Lieutenant's town address; and a few daye
after this conversation, Lieutenant Osborne received a letter, in Captain
Rawdon's school-boy hand, and enclosing a note of invitation from Miss
Crawley.
ebecca despatched also an invitation to ler darling Amelia, who, you

may be sure, was ready enough to accept it when sho hearl that George
was to be of the party. It was arranged tht Amelia was to sped the
morning with the ladies of Park Lane, where all wcre vcry kind to ler.
Rebccca patronised her with calm superiority: she wus so much the
cleverer of the two, and her friend so gentle and unassuming, that she
nlays yieldel when anybody chose to command, nnd so took llcbeccn's
orders with perfect meckness and good hmour. Miss Crwlcy's gracious-
ness was also remuarkable. She continued hcr raptures about little Anclia,
talked about her before her faco as if she werce a doll, or a servant, or a
picture, and admired her with the most bcneolent wonder possible. I
admire that admiration which thc genteel world sometimes extends to the
commonalty. There is no more ngreeuble object in life than to see Muy
Fnir folks condescending. Miss Crawley's prodigious benevolence ruther
fuatigued poor little Mmelia, nndl I am not sure tht of thc threc ladics in

George came to dinner-a repast enu gargon with Captain Crawley.
The great family coach of the Oshornes transported him to Park
Lane from Russell Square; where the young ladies, wlo were not
themselves invited, and professed the greatcst iudifference ut that slight,
neverthcless looked at Sir Pitt Crawlcy's name in the baronctage; nd
learned everything which that work had to teach about the Crawley
family and their pedigree, andl the Binkics, their rclatives, se., &c.
Rawdon Crawley rceeived George Osborne with great frunkness aud gra-
ciousness : pruaised his play at billiurds: asked him when he would lave
his revenge: was interestcd about Oshorne's regiment: und would have
proposed picquet to him that very cvening, but MIiss Crawley absolutely
tforbade any gambling in her house; so tlat the young Licutenant's
purse was not lightened by his gllant patron, for that duy at lcast.
However, they made an engagement for the next, somewhere: to look at
a horse that Crawley had to sell, and to try him in the ark; and to dine
together, and to pnss the evening with some jolly fellows. ``That is, if you 're
not on duty to that pretty Miss Scdley,'' Crawley said, with a knowing
wink.  Monstrous nice girl, 'pon my honour, though, Osborne,'' he was
good enough to add. " ILots of tin, I suppose, ehP''
Osborne wasn't on duty; he would join Crawley with plcasure: anl the
latter, whcn they met the next day, praised his ncw fricnls horscinan-
ship-as he might with perfect honesty-and introduced him to three or
four young men of the first fushion, whose acquaintance immensely clated
the simple young officer.
How 's little Miss Sharp, by-the-bye,'' Osborne inquirel of his friond
over their wine, with a dandified air.  Good-natured little girl that.
Does she suit you well at ueen's CrawleyP Miss Selley liked hcr a
good deal last ycar.''
Captain Crwley looked savagely nt the Lieutenaut out of his little blue
cyes, and watched him when he went up to resume his aequaintance with
the fair governess. Her conduct must hve relieved Crawlcey if tlere was
any jealousy in the bosom of that life-guardsman.

the Lieutennt, by way of begiuning the conversation, agreeably asked
Rebcceca how she liked her new place.

of itl It's a tolerably good plaee: the wages are pretty good-not so
good as Miss Wirt's, I believe, with your sisters in Russell Square. How
are those young ladies f-not that I ought to ask.''

Why not'' Mr. Osborne said, amazed.

Osborne was quite savage. Tle little Governess patronised him and
persiled him until this young British Lion felt quite uneasy; nor eould he
muster sufficient presence of mind to find n pretext for backing out of this
most delectable conversntion.

hours were over. Thcy added to her original regard for Mr. Osborne.
IIcr woman's instinct had toll her, that it was George who had interrupted
the suecess of her first love-passage, audl she esteemed him nccordingly.
 I only just warn you,'' he said to Rawdon Crawley, with n kowing
look-he had bought the horse, and lost some score of guineas after dinner,
 I just warn you-I kow women, and counsel you to be on the look-out.''
Thauk you, my boy,'' said Crawley, with a look of peculiar gratitude.
: Yon 're wide awake, I see.'' And George went off, thinking Crawley
was quite right.
He told Amelia of what he had done, and how he had counselled Rawdon
Crawley-a devilish good, straight-forward fellow-to be on his guard
against that little sly, scheming Rebeecn.
` Against lom 2'' Aelia cried.
Your fricend the Governess.-Don't look so astonished,''
O George, what lae you done'' Amelia said. For er woman's
eyes, which Love had made sharp-sighted, hnd in one instant diseoverceda
seeret which was invisible to Miss Crawley, to poor virgin Briggs, and,
nbove all, to the stupid peepers of that young whiskered prig, Lieutenant
Osborne.
For as Rebccca was shuwling her in an upper apartment, where these
two frienls had an opportunity for a little of that secret talking and con-
spiring which forms the delight of female life, Amelia, coming up to
Rebeeca, and taking her two littlc hands in hers, said, ``Rehecca, I sec
it all.''
Rebeeca kissed her.
And regarding this delightful secret, not one syllable more was said by
either of the young women. But it was lestined to come out before long.
Some short period after the ubove events, anl Miss Rebeceea Sharp still
remaining at her patroness's house in Park Lane, one more hntchment
might hae been seen in Great Gaunt Strcet, figuring amongst the many
which usually ornacnt that dismal quarter. It was over Sir Pitt Crawley's
house; but it did not indicate the worthy baronet's demise. It was a
feminine hatchment, and indeed a few years bnck had served as a funeral
compliment to Sir Pitt's old mother, the lnte dowager lady Crawley. Its
pcriod of serice over, the hatchment had come down from the front of the
hose, and lived in retirement somewhere in the baek premises of Sir Pitt's
mansion. It re-appeared now for poor Rose Dawson. Sir Pitt was a
widower agnin. The arms quartered on the shield along with his onn were
not, to be sure, poor Rose's. She hnd no arms. But the clerubs painted on
the scutchcon answered as well for her as for Sir Pitt's mothier, and Resuryam
was witten under the coat, flanked by the Crawley Dove and Serpent.

of the world strengthened by sucli words and comfort as he could give ler.
For mnany years his was the only kindness she ever knew; the only friend-

When the demise took place, hcr husband was in London attending to
some of his innumerable schemes, and busy with his cndless lawyers. IIe
had found time, nevertheless, to ceall often in Park ILane, and to despatch
many notes to Rebecea, entreating her, enjoining her, commanding her to
return to her young pupils in the country, who were now utterly without
companionship during thcir mother's illness. But Miss Crawley would
not her of her departure; for though there was no lady of fashion in
London who would descrt her friends more complacently as soon as she
wns tired of their society, and though few tired of them sooner, yet as long
as her egoiment lasted her attachment wus prodigious, and she cluug
still with the greatest energy to Rebecea.
The news of Lady Crawley's deatl provoked no more grief or comment
than might have been expected in Miss Crawley's family circle.  I
suppose I must put off my party for the 3rd,'' MIiss Crawlcy said; anl
added, after a pause,``I hope my brother will have the decency not to
marry again.''  What a confoundel rage Pitt will bein if he does,''
Rawdon remarked, with his usual regard for his clder brothcr. Rcbeeca
said nothing. She seemel by far the gravest and most impressed of the
fmily. She left tle room before Rawdon went away that day; but they
met by chance below, as he was going away after taking lecave, and hn a
parley together.
On the morrow, as Rebecc was gazing from the window, she startled
Miss Crawley, who was placilly occupied with a French novel, by crying
out in nn alarmed tone, ` Herce's Sir Pitt, MIa'nm.'' nnd tc baronet's
knoek followed this nnnouncement.
My dear, l1 can't see him. I wvon't see him. Tell Bowls not nt
home, or go down stairs and say I'm too ill to receive any one. MIy
neres really won't bear my brotler at this moment ;'' cried out Miss
Crawley, and resumel the noel.
 She 's too ill to see yon, Sir,'' Rebecen said, tripping down to Sir
Pitt, who was preparing to ascend.
 So much the better,'' Sir Pitt answered.  want to see yo, Miss
Becky. Come nlong a me into the parlour,'' ind they entered that apart-
ment together.
I wawnt you back ut ueen's Crawley, Miss,'' the baronet said, fixing
his eyes upou her, nnd takiug off his black gloves anl his hat with its
great crape hnt-band. His oeyes lal such a strange look, and fixed upon
ler so stedfastly, that Rebecca Sharp began almost to tremble.
I hope to come soon,'' she said in an low voice, '"as soon as liss
Crawley is better-and returu to-to the dear children,''
 ou've said so these three months, Beeky,'' replied Sir Pitt, ``and
still you go hanging on to my sister, wlo 'll fliug you off like an old shoe,

the Vuneral. Will you come back? Yes or no.''

at the very instant when Rebecen had assumed the attitude of hility.
' It is the lady on the ground, nnd not the gentleman,'' Miss Cruwley
said, with n look and voice of grcat scorn. They told me thut yo were

Refused him '' Miss Crawley sail, more bewildcred thn ever.
Briggs and Firkin at the door opened the eyes of astonishment nnd the
lips of wonder.
e Yes-refused,'' ebeccn continued, with a sad, tearful voiee.
And am I to credit my ears tht you absolutely proposel to her, Sir
Pi?'' the old lady asked.
Ees,'' snid the Baronet, `'I did.''
And she refused you as she snys2 ''
`es,'' Sir Pitt snid, his features on a brod grin.
It loes not secm to break your henrt at any rte,'' MIiss Crawlcy
remarked.
Nnawt a bit,'' answered Sir Pitt, with a cooluess and gool-humo
which set Miss Crawley almost mad with bewilderment. nt an old gen-
tleman of station should fnll on his knces to a pcnniless averuess, and
burst out laughing beceause she refused to marry him,-that n peruless
govcrness should refuse a Bnronet with four thousand a yenr,-thesc wcre
mysteries which Miss Crawley could never comprehend. It surassel any
coplications of intrigue in her favourite Pignult le Brun.

wildly through this amazement.

pleasure.

were perfectly melted witl her sadness.

brief reprieve.

who would have followel her up-stairs, she went up to her apartment;
while Briggs and Mias Crawley, in a high state of excitement, remained to
discuss the strange event, and Firkin, not less moved, dived down into the
kitchen regions, and talked of it with all the male and female company
there. And so impressed was Mrs. Firkin with the news, that she thought
proper to write off by that very night's post, ``' with her hunble duly to
Mrs. Bute Crawley and the famly at the Rectory, and Sir Pitt has been and
proposed for to marry Mliss Slarp, wherein shc las refused him to the
wonder of nll,''
The two ladies in the dining-room (where worthy Miss Briggs was
deligltel to be admitted ouce more to a confidential convcrsation with her
patroness) wondered to their hearts' content at Sir Pitt's offer, and llebccca's
refusal; riggs very acutely suggesting tlat there must have been soe
obstncle in the shape of a previous attaclnent, otherwiseno youg oman
in her senses would ever have refused so ndvantageous a proposal.
You would have accepted it yourself, wouldn't you, Briggs :'' Miss
Crnwley said, kindl.
WVoull it not be a priilege to be liss Crawley's sister P'' Briggs
replied, with meek evasion.
 II, IBecky would lave male a good Laly Crawley, after all,'' Miss
Crawley rearked, (who was mollified by the girl's refusal, and very liberal
and generous now there was no cnll for her sacrilices.) `` She hs brains in
pleuty (much more wit in her little fingcr than you hase my poor dear
riggs in all your henl.) Her mnnners are exccllcnt now l ave formed
her. She is a Montmoreucy, Briggs, anl blool is something, though I
despise it for my part; and she would have held her own amongst those
pompous stupid IInmpshire people much better than that unfortunatc
ironmonger's daughter.''
DBriggs coincided as usual, and the ``previous attachment'' was then
liscussel in conjectures. `ou poor fricudless crcatures nrc always
having some foolish tedre,'' Miss Crawley said. ``You yourself, you
know, were in love with a writing aster (don't cry, riggs-you're
ulways crying, and it won't bring him to life again), and I suppose thia
unfortunate Becky hns been silly and sentimental too-some apothecary,
or house-steward, or puinter, or young curate, or something of that sort.''
Poor thing, poor thingl'' says riggs (who was thinking of twcnty-
four ycars bnck, and that hectic young writing master whose lock of
yellow hair, and whose letters, benutiful in tleir illcgibility, she cherished
in her old desk up stais.) `Poor thing poor tling.'' says Briggs.
Once more she was n fresh-chceked lass of eighteen; she was at eveuing
churel and the hectie writing master and she were quavering out of the
sume psalm-book.
 After such conduct on Rlebeeca's part,'' Miss Crawley sail enthusiastic-
ully, ``onr family shoull do something. Find out who is the oliet,
Briggs. I'll set him up in a slop; or orler my portrait of him, you
know; or speak to my cousin the Bishop-and I'll doter Becky, and we'll

Briggs deelared that it would be delightful, and rowed that her dear

Miss Crawley was always kind and gcnerous, nnd went up to Rebececa's
bed-room to console her and prattle about the offer, and the refusal, al
the cause thereof; nnd to hint at the generous inutentions of Miss Crawlcy,
nnd to find out who was the gentleman that had the mastery of Miss
Sharp's heart.
Rebecca was ery kind, very affeetionate and affecte-responded to
Briggs' ofers of tenderness with grateful fervour-owned there was a
secret attachment-a delicious mystery-what a pity Miss bBriggs had not
remained half a minute longer at the key-holel Relecca might, perhaps,
hse told more : but fivc minutes after Miss Briggs' arrival in Rebeeca's
apartment, Miss Crawley actually made her appearance there-an unheard
of honour ;-her impatienee hnd overcome her; she could not wait for thc
tardy operations of her nmbassadress: so shc came in person, and ordercd
Briggs out of the room. And expressing ler approval of Rehecca's con-
duct, she nsked pnarticulars of the interview and thc previous transactions
which had brought about the astonishing offer of Sir Pitt.
Rebecca snid shs had long had soe notion of the partiality with
whieh Sir Pitt ouourel her, (for he wns in the habit of making his ieelings
known in a very frank nnd unreservcd anner) but, not to mention private
rcasons with which she would not for the present trouble Miss Crnwlcy,

tone. `Inleel, indeed I eed it.'' And she laid her head upon Miss
Crnwley's shoulder anl wept thcre so naturally that the old lady, surprisei
into sympathy, embracel her with an almost maternal kindness, uttered
nany soothing protests of regard and affection for her, owed that she
loved her as a daughter, and would lo everything in her power to serve

milst of mtual tears-for the eotions of the younger woman had
awakenel the sympathies of the elder-this promise was solemly
given by Mliss Crawley, who left her little protge, blessing and admir-
ing her as a dear, artless, tender-hearted, ulfectionate, incoinpreliensible
creature.
And now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful
events of the day, and of what hud been and what might have been.

this it hnve been; but now-now all was doubt aud mystery.
IBut Ilebeeea was a young iady of too much resolution and energy of
character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the
irreroctble past; so, having devoted only the proper portion of regret to
it, she wiscly turned her whole attention towards the future, which was
ow vnstly more important to her. And she surveycd her posilion, aud
its hopes, doubts, and chnees.
In the first place, she was marrial;-that was a great fct. tSir Pitt
knew it., She was not so much surprised into the avowal, as induced to
make it by a sudden cnlculation. lt must havoe come some day; and wlhy
not now as at a luter perio He who would have married her himself
must at least be silent with regar to hcr marriage. IBut how Miss
Crawley would bear the news-was the great question. MIisgivings
Relecca had; but she remcberel all Miss Crawley hal said; the old
lady's avowed contempt for birth; her daring liberal opinions; her genernl
romantic propensities; her almost doting auttachmcent to her ncphew, and
her repeatedly-cxpressed fonness for Rcbccca hersell. She is so fond of
him, Ilelecea thought, that she will forgie him anythiug: she is so used
to me that I don't think she could be comiortable without me: whcn
the lairciassement comes there will be a scene, and hysterics, nd n grenat
qunrrel, and then a great reconciliation. At all events, what use was
there in delaying' the die was throw, nnl now or to-morrow the issuc
must e the samo. Mnd so, resolved thnt Miss Crawlcy should have the
news, the young person debatel in her mind as to the best mcns of
conveying it to her; and whether she should fuce the storm that must
come, or tly and avoid it until its Iirst fury was blown over. In this stato
of mceditation she wrote the following lctter:-

spurs, and large curling mustaclios, and was indeed no other than
Cptain Ruwdon Crawley.

OW they were marriedl is not of
the slightcst conscquenee te any
body. What is to hinder a Captain
who is a major, und a young lady
who is of nge, from purchasing a
license, nnd uniting themsclves at
nny church in this townP Who
needs to be told, that if a woman
has a will, she will assuredly find
na way ?-MIy belief is, that one
day, when Miss Sharp had gone
to pass the forenoon with her
lear friend Miss Amelia Scdley,
in Russell-square, a lady very like
hcr might have been scen enter-
ing a church in the city, in co-
pany with a gentleman with dyed
muastachoes, who, after a quarter
of an hour's interval, escorted her
back to the hackney-coach in
waiting, and that this was a quict
bridal party.
Aud who on earth, after the daily experience we have, cnn qucstion the
probability of a genutleman marrying any bodyP HIow many of the wise
aul lcarned have married their cooks? Dil not Lord Eldon himself, the
most prudent of men, make a run-away matclP Were uot Achillcs and
Ajax both in love with their servant maidsP Mnd are we to expect a
heavy dragoon with strong desires and small brains, wlo had never con-
trollel a passion in his life, to bccome prudent all of a sudden, anl to
refuse to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind If
peoplc only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there
would bel
It seems to me, for my part, that Mr. Ruwdon's marriage was one of
the honestest actions which we shall have to record in nny portion of thnt
gentleman's biography which has to do with the present history. No one
will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman, or, being captiated,
to msrry her; and the admiration, the delight, the passion, the wonder,
the unbounded confidence, and frantic adoration with wlich, by degrees,
this big warrior got to regard tle little Rebecea, were feelings which the
lalies at lenst will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him,

vANITY FAIR.
When she sang, eery note thrilled in his dull soul, and tinglel tlrough
hs huge frm: Wien she spoke, le brouglt  the roree r u brans
to listen and wonder. If she was jocular, he used to revolve her jokes in
his mind, and explode over them half an hour nftcrwards in the street,
to the surprise of the groom in the tilbury by his side, or the comrde
riding with him in Rotten Row. Her words were oracles to him, her
smallest actions marked by an infallible grace anl wisdom. lIow she
sings,-how she pints,'' thought he.  How she rode that kicking mare
ant ueen's Cruley1'' And he woull say to her in confidentinl moments,
By Jove, Beek, you're fit to be Commander-in-Chief, or Archbishop of
Canterbury, by Jove.'' Is his case a rare onef anl don't we see every
day in the world many an honest IIereules at the apron-strings of Omplle,
and grent whiskered Bamsons prostrate in Dalilah's lp 
When, then, Beckey told him that the great crisis was near, and the
time for action had arrived, Rawdon expressed himself ns ready to act
under her orders, as he would be to charge with his troop at the coumand
of his colonel. There was no need for him to put lis letter iunto the third
volume of Porteus. Rebecca easily fouud a means to get rid of lBriggs,
her compnuion, and met her faithful frienl in '` the usual plnce'' on the next
day. She hnd thought over matters at night, and communicatel to nw-
don the rcsult of her determinations. He agreed, of course, to every
thing; was quite sure that it was all right; that what she proposed was
best ; that Miss Crawley would infallibly relent, or ``come roud,'' as he
said, after a time. Hnd Relccca's resolutions been entirely diferent, hc
would have followed them as implicitly. : You have head enough for
both of us, Beck,'' said he. ``oun're sure to get us out of the scraqe. I
never sa your equal, and I've mct with some clippers in my time too,''
And with this simple contfession of faith, the love-stricken dragoon left he
to exsecute lis part of the project which she had formed for the psir.
It consisted simply in the hiring of quiet lodgings at Brompton, or in
the neighbourhood of the barraeks, for Cnptain and MIrs. Crawley. For
Rebecca had determined, and very prudently, we think, to fly. luwlon
was only too happy at hcr resolve; he hnd been entreating her to take this
measure uny tie for weeks past. 1Ie praneed off to cugage the lodgings
with nll the impetuosity of love. He ngreecd to pay two guineas a wcek so
readily, that the landlady regrettcd she had asked him so little. He
orderel in a piano, and half a nursery house full of flowers, and a heap of
good things. As for shawls, kid gloves, silk stockings, gold French
watches, bracelets and perfumery, he aent them in with the profusion of
blind love und unbounded credit. And having relieved his mind by this
outpouring of generosity, he went and dined nerously at tle club, waiting
until the great moment of his life should come.
The occurrenees of thce previous dasy; the admirable conduct of Rebecca
in refusing nn offer soadvantageous to her, the secret unhappiness preying
upon her, the sweetness and silence with which she bore her aflliction,
mnde Miss Crawley much more tender than usunl. An event of this
nature, n marriage, or a refusal, or a proposal, thrills through a whole
houseful of women, and sets all their hysterical sypathies at work. As
A NOEL WIIEOUI A HERO.

nn observer of human nature, I regularly frequent St. Gcorge's, Hanover
Square, during the genteel marriuge senson; and though I havenescr seeu
the bridegroom's male friends give way to tenrs, or the bendles and ollici-
ating clergy any wny aflected, yet it is not at all uncommon to see women
who are not in the least concerned in the operations going o-old ladies
who are long past marrying, stout midle-aged females with plenty of sons
and dnghters, let alone pretty young creatures in pink bonncts, who are
on their promotion, and may naturally take nn interest in the ceremony,-I
say it is quite common to see the women prescnt piping, sobbing, sniflling.
hiding their little faces in their little useless poeket-handkerchiefs, and
heaving old and young with enotion. When my friend, the fashionable
John ilico, marriel the lovely Lady Belgravia Green Parkcr, the emo-
tion was so general, that even the little snully old pew-opener who lct mo
into thie seat, was in tears. And wherefore? I cnquired of my own soul:
sle was not going to be married.
Miss Crawley and Briggs in a word, after the alfir of Sir Pitt, indulgel
in the utmost luxury of sentiment, and llebeccn became an object of the
most tender interest to then. In her absence Miss Crawley solaced ler-
self with the most sentimental of the novels in her library. Little Slarp,
with her secret griefs, was thce heroine of the dny.
lnt night ebecca sang ore swveetly and talked ore plensantly thnn
she had ever been heard to do in Pnrk Lane. She twined hcerself round
the hcart of Miss Crawley. She spoke ligltly and laughingly of Sir Pitt's
proposal, ridieuled it as the foolish fancy of an old man; and hcr cyes filled
with tears, and Briggs's heart with unutterable pangs of defeat, as she
said she desired no other lot thau to remnain ior ever withi her dear bcne-
facetress. `` My dear little ereature,'' the old lady said, ' I lon't intend to
let you stir for years, that you may depend upon it. As for going back
to that odious brother of mine nfter what has passcl, it is out of the ques-
tion. Iere you stay with me and lBriggs. Briggs wants to go to see
her relations very often. b3riggs, you ay go when you like. bBut ns for
you, my dcur, you must stay nnd take care of the old woman.''
II lnwdon Cruwley had been thecn and thcre present, instend of being
nt the club nervously drinking claret, the pair might have gone down on
their knees before tho old spinster, avowed all, and been forgiven in a
twinkling. But that good chunce was lenicl to the young couple, doubt-
less in order that this story miglt be written, in which numbers of their
wonlerful advcntures are narrnted-adventures which could never have
occurred to them if they hnd been houscd and sheltered under the com-
fortable uinteresting forgiveness of Miss Crawley.
Under MIrs. Firkin's orders, in the Park Lnne establishment, was a young
woman from klnmpshire, whose business it wns, aumong other duties, to
knock at Mies Sharp's door with that jug of hot water, which Firkin
wrould rather hnve perished thnn have presented to the intruder. This
girl, bred on the family estate, had n brother in Cnptain Crawley's troop,
and if the truth were known, I duresay it would come out that she was
aware of certnin arrangements, which have a great deal to do with this
history. At any rnte she purchased an ycllow shal, a pair of grcen boots,

and a light blue hat with a red feuther, with three guineas which Rebecca
gave her, and as little Sharp was by no means too liberal with her money,
no doubt it was for services rendered that Betty Mnrtin was so bribed.
On the svconl day after Sir Pitt Crnwley's offer to Miss Sharp, the sun
rosce as usual, and at the usual hour Betty Mnartin, tle upstairs maid,
knocked at the door of the governess's bed-chamber.
No answer was returned, and she knocked again. Silence was still
uninterrupted ; and Bctty, with the hot water, opened the door and en-
tered the chambher.
he little white dimity bel was as smooth and trim as on the day previous
whcn Betty's own hands had helped to make it. Two little trunks were
corded in one end of the room; and on the table before the window-on
the pincuslion-the great fat pinetshion lined with pink inside, and twilled
like a lady's nightcap-ly a letter. -. It had been reposing there probably
all night.
Betty advanced towards it on tiptoe, as if she were afraid to awake it-
looked at it, and round the room with an air of great wonder and satisfao-
tion, took up tho letter, and grined intensely as she turned it round and
oer, and fiually cnrried it in to Miss Briggs's room below.
How coul Betty tell that the letter was for Miss Briggs, I should like
to know All the schooling Betty had was at Mrs. Bute Crawley's Sun-
day Schiool, and she could no more read wtRing than Hebrew.
`La, Miss Briggs,'' tle girl cxselaimel, ' O,liss, something must hase
happecned-tleres noioly in Miss Sharp's roor; the bed aint been slep
in, and slie've ri away, and left tlis letter for you, Miss.''
 I.'' eries Briggs, dropping her comb,the thin wisp of faded
hair falling over her shoulders ; '`an elopementl MIiss Sharp a fugitie .
Whnt, what is this'' and she eagerly broke the neat seal, and, as they
say, ``devoured the coutents'' of the letter addressed to hcer.
Denr Miss IBriggs,'' the refugee wrote, `` the kindest heart in the world

world. O, my excellent and kind friend, intercecde with my Rawdon's
beloved aunt for hi and the poor girl to whom all lis nolle race have
shown such anparalleled afection. Ask Miss Crawlcy to receive ler chil-
dre. I ean say no more, but blessings, blessings on all in the deur house
I leave, prys
 MiInight.''
 Your affectionate and gratfl,
 REBEccA CnAWLEY,''
Just ns Briggs had finished renling this affccting and interesting docu-
ment, whieh reinstated her in hcr position as first conlfidante of Miss Cruw-
ley, Irs. Firkin entered the room.  Ilere's Mrs. lBute Crawley just
arrived by the mail from Hampshire, nnd wants some teu, will you come
lown and make breakfust, Miss2''
Anl to the surprise of irkin, clasping her ressing-gown around ler,
the wisp of hir floating dishcvelled bechiul her, the little curl-papers still
stickiug in bunches rounl her forcheuul, Briggs sailed down to MIrs. lute
ith the letter in her hnnd containing the wonderful news.
 Oh, Mrs. Firkin,'' gasped hBetty, '`scch a business. MIiss Shar
have a gone and run away with the Cuptingg, and thcy're ofl' to Grctny
Green.'' WWe would devote n chapter to describe the cmotions of MIrs.
Firkin, did not thc passions of ler mistresses occupy our genteelcr musc.
When MIrs. Bute Crawley, numbed with midnight travclling, anl warm-
ing herself at the newly crackling parlour fire, herd fromn Miss Briggs the
intelligence of the clandestine muarriage, she declared it was quite provi-
lential tht she should havse arrived at such a time to assist poor dear
Miss Crawley in supporting the shock-tht lcbccca was an artful little
hussy of whom she had always had her suspicions; and that ns fonr
lawdon Crawley, she never could acconnt for his aunt's infutuation regard-
ing him, and had long considerel him a profligate, lost, and abndoned
eing. Aud this awlul condct, MIrs. Bute said, ill have at least tis
good effect, it will open poor dear Miss Crawley's cyes to the real cha-
racter of this wickel mn. Thcn MIrs. Bute had a comfortable hot toust
and tea; and as there was a vacant room in the house now, there was
o need for hcr to remain at thc Gloster Coffe Housce where the ortsmouth
mail had set her down, and whence shc ordered MIr. Bowls's aile-de-camp
the footman to bring away her trunks.
Miss Crawley, be it known, did not leave her room until near noon-
taking chocolate in bed in thc morning, while Becky Shrp rend thc
Morning ost to her, or otherwise amusing hersclf or dawdling. The
conspirators bclow agrcel tht they would spare the denr lady's feelings
until she appeared in her drawing-room: meanwhile it was announced to
her, that Mrs. Bute Crnwley hd come up from Hampshire by the mail,
was staying at the Gloster, sent her love to Miss Crawley, and asked for
breakfast with Mliss Briggs. The arrisnl of Mrs. Bute, which would not
have caused any extreme delight at another period, was hailcd with plea-
sure now; Miss Crawley being pleased at the notion of a gossip with her
sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawley, the funeral arrangcmcnts
penuling, and Sir Pitt's abrupt proposals to Rebecea.
142
YANITY FAIR.
It was not until the old lndy was fuirly ensconeed in her usual arm-
chair in the drawing-room, and the prcliminary embraces and inquiries
had taken pluace between the lndies, thnt the conspirators thought it ndvis-
nble to submit her to the operation. Who has not admired the artifices
and dclicate approacles with whicl women ``prepare'' their friends for
bal newsP Mliss Crawley's two frienls made such an apparatus of mys-
tery before they broke the intelligence to her, that tley worked her up to
the necessary degrce of doubt and alarm.
`'And sle refused Sir Pitt, my dear dear Miss Crawley, prepare your-
self for it,'' Mrs. Bute snid, ``because-beeause she couldn't help herself.''
Of course there was a reason,'' Miss Crawley answerel. ``She like
somebody else. I told Briggs so yesterday.''
 Likles somebody else1'' Briggs gasped. O my dear friend, she is
mnrried already.''
Married alrealy,'' Mrs. Bute chimel in; and both sate with clasped
Iands looking from each other at their victim.
` Send her to me, the instant she comes in. The little sly wretcl: how
lnrcd she not tcll me?'' eried out Miss Crawley.
She won't come in soon. Prepare yourself, dear friend-she's gone
out fo  long time-she's-she 's gone altogether.''
 Gracious goodness, and ho's to mnke my chocolate Sond for her
and have hcr back; I desire that she come bnek,'' the old lady said.
She lccnmped last night, Ma'am,'' cried Mrs. Bute.
 She left a letter for me,'' Briggs exclaimed.  She's married to-''
Prepare her, for heaven's sake. Don't torture her, my denr Miss
riggs.''
`She's mnarried to whom ?'' eries the spinster in a nervous fury.
 o-to a relation of --''.
 She refused Sir Pitt,'' eried the victim. ` Speak at once. Don't
rive me mad.''
eO Ma'am-prepare her, Miss Briggs-she's married to awdon
Crnwley.''
' wdon married-Rebecca-governess-nobod-Get out of my
housce, you fool, you idiot-you stupid old Briggs-how dare you?
You 're in the plot-you male him marry, thinking that I'd lcave my
money from him-you did, Mnrthn,'' the poor old lady screamed in
hysterie sentences.
I, Ma'am, ask a member of this fmily to marry a drawing-master's
daughter 2''
 Her mother was a Montmoreney,'' cried out the old ldy, pulling at
the bell with all her might.
 Her mother was an opera girl, aud she has been on the stage or
worse herself,'' snid Mrs. Bute.
Miss Crawley gave n final scream, and fell back in a faint. They were
forced to take her baek to the room which she had just quittel. One ft
of hysterics succeeded another. The doctor was sent for-the apotheeary
arrived. Mrs. Bute took up the post of nurse by her bedside. `:1Ier
relations ought to be round about hcr,'' that amiable woman said.
She had scareely been carried up to her room, when a new person

Bhe's coning with me to ueen's Crawley,''

titious unionP'' Briggs asked.
What 's that to me?'' Sir Pitt asked. Ikuow she 's marriel. hat
makes no ods. Tell ler to ceome down nt onee, and not keep me.''
`' Are you uot aware, Sir,'' Miss Briggs asked, `` that she has left our
roof, to -the dismay of Miss Crawley, who is nearly killcd by the intelli-
gence of Captain Rawdon's union with her?''
WYhen Sir Pitt Crawley heard thut Rebccca was marriel to his son, he
broke out iuto a fury of language, whic it would do no good to repeat in
this place, as indeed it sent poor IBriggs shuddering out of the roo; annd
with her we will shut the door upon the figure of the frenziel old man,
wild with latred and insane with batlled dcsire.
One dy after he went to ueen's Crawlcy, he burst liko a madman
into the room she hl used when there-dashed open hcr boxes with his
foot, and flung about her papers, clothes, and other relics. Miss llorrocks,
the butler's dnughter, took some of them. The ehildren dressed themn-
selves and acted plays in the others. It was but n few days after thc
poor mother had gone to her lonely burying-place; and was laid, unwept
and disregarded, in a vault full of strungers.
Buppose the old lady doesn't come to,'' Rawdon said to lis little wife,
as they sate together iu the snug little Brompton lodgings. She hd been
trying the new piano oll the oruing. he new gloves fitted her to a
nicety; the new shawls became her wouderfully; the ne riugs glittered on
har little hands, anl the new watch ticked at hcr waist; ``suppose sle
don't come round, eh, Becky '
I'll make your fortune,'' she said; and Dalilah patted ameon's
cheek.
 You can do anything,'' he snid, kissing the little hand.  By Jove,
you can; and we'll drive down to the Star and Garter, and dine, by Jove.''

days, when she used to play upon it, in the little sitting-room of our denr
Aelia Sedley.
The sale was at the old house in lussell Squnre, whcre we passed somc
evenings together at the beginning of this story. Good old John Sedley
was a ruined man. His name had been proclaimed as n defaulter on the
Stock Exchange, and his bankruptcy and comnercinl extermination had
followcd. Mr. Osborne's butler came to buy some of the famons port
wine to transfer to the cellars over the way. As for one dozen well-
manufactured silver spoons and forks at per oz., and one dozen dessert
litto ditto, there were thrce young stockbrokers (Mesers. Dale, piggot,
and Dale, of Threadneedle street, indeed), who having hal dealings with
the old man, and kindnesses from him in days when he was kind to
cvery boly with whom he dealt, sent this little spar out of the wreek with
thcir love to good MIrs. Sedley; and with respcct to the piano, ns it hal
been Amelin's, nnd ns she miglt miss it and want one now, and as Capn-
tain William Dohbin could no more play upon it, than he could dance on
the tight-rope, it is probnble tlmnt he did not purchase it for his own use.
In n word, it arrived that evening, at a wonderful small cottagc in a
strcet leading from the Fullnm Road-one of those streets which have
the finest romnntie names-(this wns cnllel St. Adelaide Villns, Ana-
Maria Roal, West), where the houses look like babsy-houses; wlere the
people looking out of the first-floor windows, must infallibly, as you think,
sit with their feet in the parlours; where the shrubs in the little gardens
in front, bloom with a percnninl disnlay of little children's pinafores, little
rced socks, caps, &c. (polyandria polygyniu); whencec you hear the sound
of jingling spinets and women singing; where little portcr pots hang on
thc railings sunning themselves; whither of cvenings you see city clerks
pading wearily : here it wns that Mr. Clapp, thce elerk of Mr. Selley, had
his domieile, annd in this asylum the good old gentleman hid his hcud
ith his wife aud daughter when the crash camc.
Jos Sedley had ucted as a man of his disposition would, when thc an-
ouncement of the family-misfortune reachicd him. lIe did not comc to
London, but he wrote to his mother to draw upon his agents for whatever
money was wnnted, so that bis kind broken-spirited old parents hud no
resent poverty to fear. This done, Jos wenl on at the boarding-house

his elaret; he played his rubber; he toll his Indian stories, and the Irish
widow consoled and flattered him ns usual. IIis present of money, neeilful
as it was, made little imprcssion on his parents; aud I have heard Amclia
say, tlnt the first day on which she saw her fther lift u his head uften
the fiailure, was ou the receipt of the packet of forks nnd spoons with the
young stockroker's love, over which e burst out, crying like a child,
being greatly more affected than even his wife, to whom the present was
addressed. Edward Dale, the junior of the housc, who purchased the
spoons for tlie firm, was, in fct, very swctet upon Amelia, and offered for
her in spite of all. Ho married Miss Louisa Cutts (duglter of 1ligham

its quiet family trecasurcs given up to publie desecration and plunder. A

n lorse laugl, had expressed a perfect williugness to see young George
Osborne agnin. 1Ie's a very agreeable acquaintance, Beok,'' the wag

gentlcman in Yauity Fair considers to be is due from his neighbour.
The old Aunt was long in `` coming-to.'' A month had elapsed. awdon

meut in the house at Park Lane; his letters were sent back unopened.
MIiss Crnwley never stirred out-she was unwell-and Irs. Bute remainel

Iromn the continued presence of MIrs. Bute.

 ll, I don't regret it, if you don't,'' the Captsin cried, still in an amo-
rous rapture with is wife, who rewarded him with a kiss by way of reply,
and wns indeed not a little gratified by the geuerous confidence of her
husband.
 If he had but a little more rains,'' she thought to herelf,  I might
make something of him;'' but she never let him perceive the opinion she
d of him; liatened with indefatigable coplacency to his stories of the
stable and the mcss; laughed at all his jokes ; felt the greatest intereat in
Jack Spatterdash, whose cab-horse had come down, and Bob Mnrtingale,
who hal bcen taken up in a gnmbling-louse, and Tom Cinqbars, who was
going to ride the stceple-chase. When he came home she was alert and
happy: when he went out she pressed him to go: when he stayed at home,
she plsyed and sang for him, made him good drinks, superintended his
dinner, warmed his slippers, and steeped his soul in comfort. The best of
women (I have heard my grandmother say) are hypocrites. We don't know
how much tley hide from us: how watcful they are when they seem most
artless and confidential : how often those frank smiles which they wear so
easily, are traps to cajole or elude or disarm-I don't mean in your mere
eoquettes, but your domestiec models, and paragons of female virtue. WYho

enjoyments. Mnjor Martingnle never thought about asking to scee the

UR surprised story now finls itself
for n moment amon;g very famous
events and personnages, and hanging
on to the skirts of listory. When
the eagles of Napoleon onparte,
the Corsican upstart, were flying
from Provenee, wlere they hd
perched after a brief sojourn in
Elba, and from steeple to steeplec
until they reachel the towers of
Notre Dne, I wonder whether
the Imperinl birls had any eye fora
little corner of the parish of Blooms-
bury, London, which you might hae
thought so quict,that even te whir-
ring and flapping of those miglty
wings would pass unobserved there
Napoleon has landed at Cannes.''
Such ncews might create a panic
at Vienna, nnd cuse Russia to drop his carls, and take Prussin into n
corner, and Tnlleyrand and Mctternich to wag their heads together, whilc
Prineo Hardenberg, and een the present Mnrquis of Londonderry, wera
puzzled ; but how was this intelligence to nafect n young lady in Hussell
quare, before whose door the watchmn sang the hours when slc was
asleep: who, if she strolled in the square, was guarded there by the
railings and the beadle: who, if she walked ever so short a distance to
buy a ribbon in Southampton Row, was followed by black Sambo with nn
enormous cane: who was always cared for, dressed, put to bed, and
watched over by eer so many guardian angels, with and without wages.
Bon Dien, I say, is it not hard that the fateful rush of the great Imperial
astruggle can't take place without affecting a poor little hurmless girl of
eighteen, who is occupied in billing and cooing, or working muslin collars
in Russell SquareP YTou, too, kindly, homely flower l-is the great roar-

Old Sedley ld kept lis own snd counsel. Everything sccmed to go on
as usual in the quiet, opulent house: the good-naturel mistress pursuing,
quitc unsuspiciously, her bustling idleness, and daily easy avocutions; the
daughter absorbed still in one sellish, tendcr thought, and quite regard-
less of all the world besides, when tlat fnul crash cae under whieh the
worthy family fell.
One night Mrs. Sedley was writing cards for a party; the Osbores had
given one, and she must not be behiundhand; John Sedley, who had come
home very lnte from the city, sate silent ut the chimuey side, while his
wile was prattling to himn; Emmy had gone up to er room ailing and

John Sedley sprng up out of lis chair to meet his wife, who run to
him. He scized her in his arms, anl sid with a hasty voice,  We're
ruined, MIury. We've got the world to begin over again, dear. It's best
that you slould know all, and at onee.'' As he spoke, he trembled in
every limb, and almost fell. lIe thought the news would lve ovcr-
powvercl his wife-his wife, to whomn he had never said a hard word. lBut
it wns he that ws the most moved, sudden as the slock was to her.
Whcn he sank bnck into his seat, it was the wife that took tle ottice of
consoler. She took lis trenbling hand, nnd kissecl it, nnd put it round
her neck: she called him her John-her dear John-her old mau-her
kind old man: she poured out a hndred words of iucohercnt love and
tenderncss; her fuithful voice and simple caresses wrought this sad heart
up to nn inexpressible delight and nguish, nnd clcered and solaced his
overburdeued soul.
Only once in the course of the long night as they sate together, nnd
poor Seley opened his pent-up soul, and told the story of his losses and
embarrassments-the treason of' some of his oldest iriends, the mnly
kindness of some from whom he never could have expected it-in a
general confession-only once lid the luithlul wife give way to euotion.

ran understan1 Our gentle Amclia was thus solitary. Shc hd no
confidante, so to speak, ever since she had anytling to confide. Shoc
could not tell the oll mother her doubts nnd cures: tho woull-be sisters
seemed every dy more strage to hcr. And she had misgivings and fcurs
which she dared not acknowledge to herself, though sle was always
secretly brooding over them.
Her heart triel to persist in asserting that George Osborne was worthy
and faithful to her, tlough she knew otherwise. How many a thing hd
she said, and got no echo from him. IlIow many suspicions of selfishess
nnd indifference had she to encounter and obstinately overcome. To
whom could the poor little martyr tell thcse daily struggles and torturcs ?
Her lero himself only half understool her. She did not dare to own
that the man she loved ws hcr iuferior; or to feel that she had given her
heart away too soon. Given onee, the purte bashful maiden was too
modest, too tender, too trustful, too weak, too much woman to rccal it,
We nare 'lurks witl the nffiections of our women; and hnve male them
subscribe to our loctrine too. We let their bodies go abrond libcrally
enough, with smiles nnd rinuglets and pink bonnets to disguise them insteal
of veils and yakmaks. But tleir souls must be scn by only one man,
and they obey not unwillingly, and consent to remain nt lome as our
laes-ministering to us and doing drudgery for us.
So imprisoned and tortured was this gentle little heart, wlen in the
month of Mareh, Anno Domino 1815, Napoleon landel at Cnes, an
Louis XVIII. fled, and all Europe was in alarm, and the funds fell, and
old Joh Sedley wass ruined.
We are not going to follow the worthy old stockbroker through those
last pangs and agonies of ruin through which he passed before his com-
mercial demise befel. They declared him at the Stock Exchnge; he vas
ubsent from his house of business: his bills were protcsted : his act of
bankruptcy formnl. The house nnd furniture of Russell Square were
scized and sold up, and he and his famnily were thrust away, as we have
seen, to hile tleir heads where they might.
John Sedley had not the heart to revicw the domestic establisluuent
who havc appeared now and nnon in our pages, and of whom he was now
forced by poverty to take lcave. hc wages of those worthy people were
disclarged with tlat punctuality which men frequeutly slow who only owc
in greut sums-they were sorry to leave good places-but they did not
break their hearts at parting from their adored mastcr and mistrees.

infatuntion of his profession, deterined on setting up a public-house.

cnsued, and larassed the feelings of the humiliatel old gentleman so
scverely, that in six weecks he oldened ore than he had done for fifteen
years bhefore-the nost etermined and obstinate seemed to be Jolmn
Osborne, his old friend and neighbour-John Osborne, whom he had set
p in life-who was under a hundred obligations to him-and whose son
was to marry Scdley's daughter. Any one of these cireumstances would
account Ior the bitternees of Osborne's opposition.
When one man has been under very remarknble obligations to another,
with whom he subsequently quarrels, a common sense of deeency, as it
were, makes of the former a much severer enemy than a merestranger would
be. To account for your own hardheartcdness and ingratitude in such a
case, you are bound to prove thc othcr party's crime. It is not that you
are selfish, brutal, and angry at the failure of a speculation-no, no-it is
that your partner has led you into it by tle bascst treacery and with the
most sinister motives. From a mere seuse of consistency, a persecutor is
bound to shew that the fallen man is a villaiu-otherwise he thc persccutor
is a wrctch limself.
And as a general rule, which may make all cereditors who are inclined
to be severe, pretty comfortable in their minds, no men embarrassed are
altogether houest, very likely. They conceal something; they exaggerute
chances of good-luck, hide away tho rcal state of nffairs, say that thiugs
are flourishing when they are hopeless : keep a siling face (a dreary
smile it is) upon the verge of bnnkruptcy-are ready to lay hold of any
pretext for delay, or of any money, so as to stave off the inevilable ruin a
fewdays longer. ``Down with suldislonesty,'' says thecreditor in triumph,
and reviles his siuking enemy. : You fool, why do you catch at a straw ''
calm good scnse says to the man that is drowning.  You villain, why do
you shrink from plunging into the irrctrievable Gazette ?'' says prosperity

When the great crash ceame-the annouucement of ruin, and the de-
parture from Russell Square, nnd the declaration thnt all was over between
her and George-all over between her nnd love, her and happiness, her
and faith in the world-a brutal letter from John Osborne told her in a
few curt lines that her futher's conduct had been of such a nature that all
engagements between the fmilies were ant an end-when the final awarl
cume, it did not slock her so muceh ns her parents, us her mother rather
expected (for Johmn Sedley himself was entirely prostrate in the ruins of
his own atfairs and shattered honour). hmelia took the news vcry pulely
and calmly. It was only the confirnation of the dark presages which had
long gone before. It was the mere reading of the sentencc-of the crime
she had long ago been guilty-the crime of loving wrongly, too violently,
against reason. She told no more of her thoughts now than she had
before. She scemed scuarcely more unhappy now wheu couvinced nll
hope was over, than before when she felt but dured not eoufess that it
was gone. So she changed from the large housc to thc small one wihout
any mark or difference ; remaincl less in her little room for the ost
part; pined silently; and dic away duy by lay. I do not ean to say

two heroes of ours, Captain Dobbin aud Captain Osborne, formed a

whio knows that famous corps. rom tle colonel to the smallest drummer
in the regiment, all were filled witlh hope and ambition and patriotic iury;
nnd thanked the French Emperor as for a personal kindness in coming
to disturb the peace of Europe. Now was the time the -th lad so
long panted for, to show their comrades in arms that they could fight as
ell as the Peninsular veterans, and that all the pluck and valour of the
-th had not been killed by the West Indies and the yellow fever. Stubble
and Spoony looked to get their companies without purchase. Before the
end of the campaign (which she resolvel to slare), Mrs. Maijor O'Dowd

cnlly-was bent upon doing his duty, nnd gaining his share of honour anl
distinction.
Te agitation tlrilling through the country and army in consequence of
this news was so great, that private matters were little leeded: and henece
probably George Osborne, just gazetted to his company, busy with prepa-
rations for the march, which must come inevitably, and panting for furthcr
promotion-was not so much affected by other incidents which would

fessed, very much cast down by gool old Mr. Sedley's catastrophe. He
tried his new uniform, which becume him very handsomely, on the day
when the first mecting of the creditors of the unlortunate gentleman took
place. His father told him of the wicked, rascally, slameful conduct of
the bankrupt, remindel him of what he had said about Amelia, aud that
their conncxion was broken off for ever; and gave him that evening a
good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in which he
looked so well. Money was always useful to this free-hnded young
fellow, and he took it without many worls. The bills were up in the
Sedley housc, wlere he hal passed so many, many happy hours. Hc could
sce them as he walked from home that night (to theOld Slaughtera', where
he put up when in town) shining wlite in the moon. That comfortable
home was shut, then, upon Amelia and hcr parents: where had thcy taken
refugef The thought of tleir ruin affected him not a little. He was
very melancholy that night in the colfec-room at the Slaughtcrs; and
urank a good deal, as his comrades remarked there.
Dobbin came in presently, cautioned him about the drink, which he
only took, he said, because he wns dcuced low; but when his friend
bcgan to put to him clumsy inquiries, and asked him for news in a signi-
ficant manner, Osborne declined entering into conversation with him;
avowing, however, that he was devilish disturbed and unhappy.
Three days aftecrwarls, Dobbin founl Osborne in his room at the bar-
racks :-his head on the table, a number of papers about, the young
Captain evidently in a state of great desponlency. ` She's-she's sent
me back some things I gave her-some damned trinkets. Look heroel''
1here was a little packet direeted in the well-known hand to Captain
George Osborne, and some tlings lying about-a ring, a siler knile he
hnd bought, as a boy, for her at a fair; a gold chain, and a locket with
hair in it. ' It's all over,'' said he, with a groan of sickening remorse.
Look, Will, you may reat it if ysou like.''
There was a littleletter of a few lincs, to which he pointed, which said:
' MIy papa has ordered me to return to you these presents, which you

What a pang it was to lose all that: to have had it and not prized itl
A thousand homely scenes and recollections crowded on him-in which he
always saw her good and benutiful. And for himself, he blushed with
reorse and shame, as the remembrance of his own selfishness and indif-
ference contrasted with that perfect purity. For a while, glory, wnr, every-
thing was forgottcn, and the pair of friends talked nbout her only.

Dolbin knew. He had not merely sent tle piano; but had writtena
note to Mrs. Sedley, and asked permission to come and see her,-nnd he
had seen her, and Amelia too, yesterdny, before hc cme down to Chatham;
nnd, what is more, he had brought tht farcwell lettcr anl packet which
hnd so moved thcm.
he good-natured fellow had found Mrs. Oslrae only too willing to
eceive him, and greatly agitated by the arrivnl of the piano, which, as she'
conjectured, uat have come from George, and was n signal of nmity on
his part. Captain Dolbin did not corrcct this crror of the worthy lady,
but listcned to nll her story of complaints and misfortunes with great syn-
pathy-condoled with her losses and privatious, nnd agrced in reprchending
the cruel conduet of Mr, Osborne towards his first benefactor. When she
had eused her overtlowing bosom somewhat, and poured forth many of her
sorrows, he hnd the courage to ask actunlly to sec Amelia, who was above
in her room as usual, and whom her mother led trcmbling down stairs.
Her nppcarance was so ghastly, and her look of despair so pathetic,
that onest Willinam Dobbin wvas frigtened as he belcld it; and real the
nost fuatal forcbodings in that plec fixed face. After sitting in his com-
pany a minute or two, she put the packet into his hand, and said, `` Tkc
this to Captnin Osborne, if you please, and-and I hopec he's quite well-
nd it wns very kind of you to come and see us-and we like our new
house very much. And I-I tlink I'll go up-stairs, Mamma, for lI'm not
vcry strong.'' And with this, and a curtscy and a smile, the poor child
went her way. The mother, as she led her up, cast back looks of anguish
towards Dobbin. The good fellow wanted no such appeal. IIe locd hcr
himself too foully for that. Inexprcssibla grief, and pity, ani terror
pursuel him, and hce came nway as if he was n criminal after secing her.

Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne, this servant-

and happy, made many trials to attract poor ELmmy's attention, who,

E hae seen how Mrs. Firkin,
the lady's maid, as soon as
any event of importance to
the Crawley family came to
her knowledge, felt bound to
ceommunicste it to Mrs. Bute
Crawley, at theReetory; and
have before mentioned how
particularly kind and atten-
tive that good-natured lady
was to Miss Cruawley's confi-
dential servant. She had
been a gracious friend to
Mrs. Briggs, the companion,
also; and had secured the
latter's good will by a num-
ber of those attentions and
promises, which cost so little
in the making, and are yet so
valuable and agreeable to
the recipient. Indeed every
good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap
and yet how amiable these professions are, and what a flavour they give to
the most homely dish in life. Who was the blundering idiot who said
that '`fine words butter no parsnips?'' Half the parsnips of society are
served and rendered palatable with no other sasuce. As the immortal
Alexis Soyer can make more delicious sonp for a halfpenny than an
ignorant cook cn concoct with pounds of vegetables and meat, so a skilful
artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so
much substantial benefit-stock in the hands of n mere bungler. Nay, we
know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs; wherens, most
will digest any amonnt of fine words, and be always eager for more of the
same food. Mrs. Bute hal told Briggs and Firkin so often of the depth
of her affection for them; nd what she would do if she had Miss Crawley's
fortune for friends so excellent and attached, that the ladies in question
had the deepest regnrd for her; and felt as much gratitude and confidenee
as if Mrs. Bute lad louded them with the most expensive favours.
Rawdon Crawley, on the other hand, like a selfish heavy dragoon as he
was, never took the least trouble to conciliate his aunt's nides-de-cnamp,
showed his contempt for the pair with entire frankness-made Firkin pull
off his boots on one oceasion-sent her out in the rain on ignominious

messagee-and if he gae her a guinea, flung it to her as if it were a box
on the ear. As his Aunt, too, nade a butt of Briggs, the Captain followed
the example and levelled his jokes nt her-jokes about as delicate as a
kick from his charger. Whereas, Mrs. Bute consulted her in matters of
taste or difficulty, admired her poetry, and by a thousand acts of kinduess
and politeness, showed her appreciuation of Briggs; andl if she made Firkin
a twopenny-halfpenny prcsent, aecompanied it with so many comupliments,
that the two-penee-halfpenny was transmutel into gold in the heart of
the grateful waiting-maid, who, besides, was looking forwards quite con-
tentedly to some prodigious bcnefit wlicl must huppen to her on the day
when Mrs. Bute cae in to her fortune.
The different conduct of these two people is pointed out respecifully to
the attentiou of persons comencing the world. Praise cverybody, I say
to such: neer be squeamish, but speak out your ceompliment both point-
blank in a man's face, and behind his back, when you know there is a
reasonable chance of lis hearing it again. Never lose a chance of saying a
kind word. As Collingwood never saw a vacant place in his estate but he
took un acorn out of his pocket and popped it in; so deal with your come
pliments through life. An aeorn costs noting; but it may sprout into a
prodigious bit of timbcr.
In a word, during Rawdon Crawley's prosperity, he was only obcyed with
sulky acquicscence; when his disgraee cume, tlere was nobody to help or
pity him. Whereas, when Mrs. Bute took the command at Miss Crawley's
house, the garrison there were charmed to act under such a leader, ex-
pecting all sorts of promotion from her prouises, her generosity, and her
kind words.
That he woull consider himself beaten, after one defeat, and make no
attempt to regain the position hc had lost, Mrs. Bute Crawley never
nllowed herself to suppose. She knew Rcbecca to be too clever and
spirited, and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle; and felt
thuat she must prepare for that combat, nnd be incessantly watchful ngainst
assault, or ntine, or surprise.
In the first place, though she held the town, was she sure of the prin-
cipal inhubitantt Would Miss Crawley herself hold out; and lnd shc
not a seeret longing to welcome back the ousted uversary The old luady
likel Rawdon, and Rebecca, who amused her. Mrs. Bute could not dis-
guise from herself the fact that none of her party could so contribute to
the pleasures of the town-bred laly. ` My girls' singing, after that little
odious governess's, I know is unbearable,'' the candid reetor's wice owncd
to herself. t She always used to go to slecp when MIartha and Louisa
played their ducts. Jim's stiff college anners and poor der Bute's talk
ubout his dogs and horses always annoyed her. 1f I took ler to tle
Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, an fly, I know she would;
and might fall into thut horrid Rawdon's clutches again, and be the victim
of that little viper of a Sharp. Meanwhile, it is clear to me tlat she is
exccedingly unwell, and cnnnot move for some weeks, at any rate; during
which we mnust think of some plan to protect ler iro the urts of those
unprinciplel people.''

was, or looked ill, the trembling old lady sent of for her doctor; and I
laresay she was very unwell after the sulden family event, which might
serve to shake stronger nerves than hers. At least, Mrs. Bute thought it
was her duty to inform the physician, and the apothecary, and the dame-
de-compagnie, and the domestics, that Miss Crawley was in a most critical
state, and that they were to act accordingly. She had the astreet laid knee-
deep with straw; and the knocker put by with Mr. Bowls's plate. She
insisted that the Doetor should call twice a day; and deluged her patient
with draughts eery two hours. When anybody entered the room, she
uttered a alaslslsh so sibilant and ominous, that it frightened the poor old
lady in her bed, from which she could not look without seeing Mrs. Bute's
beady eyes eagerly fixed on her, as the latter sat steadfast in the arm-chair
by the bed-side. They seemed to lighten in the dark (for she kept the

There Miss Crawley lay for days-ever so mny days-Mrs. Bute reading
books of devotion to her : for nights, long nights, during which she had ta
hear the watchman sing, the night-light sputter ; visited at midnight, the
last thing, by the stealthy apothecary; and then left to look at Mrs. Bute's

it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death, and an utter
cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner.
Sick-bed homilies and pious relections are, to be sure, out of place in
mere story-books, and we are not going (after the fashion of some novelists
of the present day) to cajole the public into a sermon, when it is only a
comedy that the reasder pays his money to witncss. But, without preaech-
ing, the truth may surely be borne in mind, that the bustle, and triumph,
nnd laughter, and giety which Vanity Fir exhibits in public, do not
always pursue the performer into private life, and that the most dreary
depression of spirits and dismal renentances sometimes overcome him.
Recollection of the best ordained banquets will scarcely cheer sick epicures.
eminiseencees of the most becoming dresses and brilliant bull triumphs
will go very little way to console faded beauties. Perhaps statesmen, at an
particular period of existence, are not much gratified at thinking over the
most triumphant divisions; and the suceess or the pleasure of yesterday
become of very small account when a certain (albeit uncertain) morrow is
in view, abount which all of us must some day or other be speculating. O
brother wearers of motleyl Are there not moments when one grows sick
of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells This, dear
friends and companions, is my amiable object-to walk with you through

If that poor man of mine had a head on his shoulders,'' Mrs. Bute
Crawley thought to herself, `` how useful he might be, under present cir-
cstances, to this unhappy old ladyI He might make her repent of her
shoeking free-thinking ways; he might urge her to do hcr duty, and csst
off that odious reprobate who has disgraced himself and his family ; and
he might induce her to do justice to my dear girls and the two boys, who
require and deserve, I am sure, every assistance whieh their relatives can
give them.''
And, as the hatred of vice is always a progress towards virtue, MIrs.
Bute Crawley endeavonred to instil into her sister-in-law a proper abhor-
rcnce for all Rawdon Crawley's nanifold sins: of which his uncle's wife
brought forward such a catalogue as indeed would have served to condemn
a whole regiment of young officers. If a man has committed wrong in life,
I don't know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the
world than his own relations; so Mrs. lBute showed a perfect family
interest and knowledge of awdon's history. She had all the puarticulars
of that ugly quarrel with Captain Firebrnce, in wlich Rawdon, wrong from
the beginning, ended in shooting the Captain. She knew how the un-
happy Lord Dovedale, whose mnmma hal taken a house at Oxford, so that
he might be educated there, and who had never touchel a card in his life
till he came to London, was perverted by Rawdon at the Cocoa Tree, made
helplessly tipsy by this abominable seducer and perverter of youth, and
fleeced of four thousand pounds. She described with the rost viid
minuteness the agonies of the country families whom he had ruined-the
sous whom he had plunged into dishonour and poverty-the daughters

whom he had inveigled into perdition. She knew the poor tradesmen
who were bankrupt by his extravagance-the mean shifts and rogueries
with which he had ministered to it-the astounding falseloods by which
he had imposed upon the most generous of aunts, and the ingratitude and
ridionle by which he had renaid her snerifices. She imparted these stories
gradually to Miss Crwley; gave her the whole benefit of them; felt it to
be her bounden duty as a Christian woman and mother of a family to do
so; had not the smallest remorse or compunetion for the victim whom her
tongue was immolating; nay, very likely thought her act was quite meri-
torious, and plumed herself upon her rcsolute manner of perforing it.
es, if a man's character is to be abused, say what you will, there'as
nobody like a relation to do the businese. And one is bound to own,
regarding this unfortunate wretech of a Ranwdon Crawley, that the mer
truth was enough to condemn him, and that nll inventions of scandal were
quite superfluous pains on his friends' pnrts.
Rebecea, too, being non a reltive, came in for the fullest shure of Mrs.
Bute's kind inquiries. This indetfatigble pursuer of truth (aving given
strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissarics or letters
from Rnwdon), took Miss Crawley's carriage, and drove to her old fricnd
Miss Pinkerton, at Minerva House, Chiswick Mnll, to whomn she nnnounced
the dreadful intelligence of Cnptain Rawlon's seduction by Miss Sharp,
and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the ex
governess's birth and early history. The friend of the Lexicographer had
plenty of information to give. Miss Jemima was male to fetch thc draw-
ing-master's receipts and letters. This one was from a spunging-house:
that entreated an advunce: another was full of gratitude for Ilebecca's
reeeption by the ladies of Chiswick: and the last document from the
unlucky artist's pen wns that in which, from his dying bed, e recom-
mended his orphan child to Miss Pinkerton's protection. There were
juvenile letters and petitions from Ilebecca, too, in the collection, imploring
aid for her father, or delaring her own gratitude. Perhaps in Vanity Fair
there are no better sntires than lctters. Take a bundle of your dear

From Miss Pinkerton's the indefatigable Mrs. Bute followed the track
of Sharp and his dauglter back to the lodgings in Greek Street, wlioh

the defunet painter had oecupied ; and where portraits of the lndlady in
white satin, anl of the husband in brass buttons, done by iSharp in lieu of
n qunarter's rent, still lecorated the parlour walls. Mrs. Stokes was a
communicative person, and quickly told all she knew about Mr. Sharp;
how dissolute and poor he was; how good-natured and amusing; how he
was always hunted by bailiffs and duns; how, to the landlady's horror,
though she neer could abile the woman, he did not marry his wife till a
short time before her death; and what a queer little wild vixen his dauglter
was; how she kept them all laughing with her fun and mimicry; how she
used to fetch the gin from the public-house, and was know in all the
studios in the quarter-in brief, Mrs. Bute got sueh a full account of her
new niece's parentage, education, and behaviour as would scnrcely have
pleased Rebecca, had the latter known that such inquiries were being made
concerning her.
Of all these industrious researches Miss Crawley had the full benefit.
Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was the dauglter of an opera girl. She had danced
herself. She had been a model to the painters. She was brought up as
became her mother's daughter. She lrank gin with her father, &e. kc.
It was a lost woman who was married to a lost man; and the morul to
be inferred from Mrs. Bute's tale was, that the knavery of the pair was
irremediable, and that no properly-conducted person should ever notice
them again.
These were the materials which prulent MIrs. Bute gatlered together
in Prk Lane, the provisions and amnunition as it were with which she
fortifiel the house against the siege which she knew that Rawdon and his
wife would lay to Miss Crawley.
But if an fault may be found with her arrangements, it is this, that she
was too cager: she managed rather too well; undoubtedly she made Miss
Crawley more ill than was necessary; and though the old invalid suc-
cumbe to her authority, it was so harassing and severe, that the victim
would be inclined to escape at the vcry first chance which fell in her way.
Mnnaging women, the ornaments of their sex,-women who order every-
thing ior everybody, and know so much hetter than any person concerned
what is good for their ncighbours, don't sometimes speculate upon the
possibility of a domestie revolt, or upon other extreme consequenees
resulting from their overstrained authority.
Thus for instance Mrs. Bute, with the best intentions no doubt in the
world, anl wearing herself to death as she did by foregoing sleep, dinner,
fresh air, for the sake of her innlid sister-in-law, carried her conviction of
the old lady's illness so far thnt she almost managed her into her coffin.
She pointed out her sacrifices and tleir results one day to the constant
apotheecary, Mr. Clump.
I am sure, my dear Mr. Clump,'' she said, '`no efforts of mine lave
been wanting to restore our dear invalid, whom the ingratitude of her
nephew has laid on the bed of sickmess. I never shrink from personal
discomfort: I never refuse to sacrifice myself.''
Your devotion, it must be confessed, is admirable,'' Mr. Clump says,
with a low bow; `` but--''

t Ihae scarcely closed my eyes since my arril: I give up sleep, health,
every comfort, to my sense of duty. When my poor James was in the
asmall-pox, did I allow any hireling to nurse himP No.''
You did what became an excellent mother, my dear Mndam-the best
of mothers; but-''
`As the mother of a family and the wife of an English clergyman, I
humbly trust that my principles are gool,'' Mrs. Bute said, with a happy
solemnity of convietion; ``and, as long as Nnture supports me, never,
never, Mr. Clump, will I desert the post of duty. Others may bring that
gray heal with sorrow to the bel of sickness, (ere Mrs. Bute, waving her
hand, pointel to one of old Miss Crawley's eoffee-coloured fronts, which
wns perched on a stand in the dressing-room), but I will never quit it.
Ah, Mr. Clumpl I fear, I know, that that couch needs spiritual as well as
medical consolation.''
What I was going to observe, my dear Malam,''-here the resolute
Clump once more interposed with u bland air-``whnt I was going to
observe when you gave utterance to sentiments which do you so mucl
honour, was that I think you alarm yourself needlessly about our kind
friend, and sacrifice your own health too prodigally in her favour.''
I would lny down my life for my duty, or for any member of my
husband's family,'' Mrs. Bute interposel.
 Yes, Madam, if need were; but we don't want Mrs. Bute Cruwley to
be a martyr,'' Clump sail gallantly. Dr. Squills anl myself have both
considered Miss Crawley's case with every anxiety and carc, as you may
suppose. We see her low-spirited and ncrvous; family events have agi-
tated her''
 Her neplew will come to perdition,'' Mrs. Crawley cried.
Have agitated her: and you arrived like a guardian angel, my dcnr
Madam, a positive guardian angel, I assure you, to soothe her under
the pressure of calamity. But Dr. Squills anl I were thinking that our
amiable friend is not in such a state as renders confinement to her bed
necessary. Sle is depressed, but this confinement perhaps adds to her
depression. She should have change, fresh air, giety; tle most delight-
ful remedies in the pharmacopia,'' Mr, Clump sil, grinuing and showing
his handsome tceth. Persuade hcr to rise, dear Mndam; drag her from
her couch and her low spirits; insist upon her takmg little drives. hey
will restore the roses too to your cheoks, if I may so speak to Mrs. lBute
Crawley.''
The sight of her horrid nephew casually in the Park, where I am told
the wretch drives with the brazen partner of his crimes,'' Mrs. Bute snid,
(etting the cat of selfishness out of the bag of seerecy), ``would cnuse her
such a shock, thnt we should hve to bring her back to bed again. She
must not go out, Mr. Clump. She shall not go out as long as I remain
to watch over her. And as for ny health, what matters it? I givoe it
cheerfully, Sir. I saerifice it nt the altar of my duty,''
 Upon my worl, Mndnm,'' Mr. Clump now said bluntly, I won't
answer for her life if she remains locked up in that dark room. She is so
nervous that we may lose her any day; and if you wish Captain Craley
to be her heir, I warn you frankly, Malam, that you are doing your very
best to sere him.''
188
AITY AIR.
e Gracious mereg1 is her life in dangerP'' Mr. Bute cried.  Why,
why, Mr. Clump, did you not inform me sooner2''
he night before, Mr. Clump and Dr. Squills had had a consultation (over
 bottle of wine at the house of Sir Lapin Warren, whose lady was about
to present him with a thirteent blessing), regarding Niss Crawley and
her cse.
What a little harpy that woman from Hampshire is, Clump,'' Squills
remarked, `` that has seized upon old Tilly Crawley. Devilish good
Mndeira.''
e What a fool Rawdon Crawley has been,'' Clump replied, ``to go and
marry a governessl There was something about the girl, too,''
 Green eyes, fair skin, pretty figure, famous frontal development,''
Squills remarked. There is something about her; and Crawlcy aas a
fool, Squills.''
A d- fool-alwys was,'' the apothccary replied.
Of ecourse the old girl will fling him over,'' said the physician, ad
after a pause added, ` She'll cut up well, I suppose,''
Cut up,'' says Clump with a grin; ` I wouldn't hae her cut up for
two hundred a year.''
e That Hampshire woman will kill her in two months, Clump, my boy,
if she stops about her,'' Dr. Squills snid. :Old womnn; full feeder;
ncervous subject; palpitation of the heart; pressure on the brain; apo-
plexy; off she goes. Get her up, quills; get her out: or I would'nt
give many weeks' purchase for your two hundred a year.'' And it was
acting upon this hint that the worthy apothecary spoke with so much can-
dour to Mrs. Bute Cruwley.
HIaving the old lady under her hand; in bed; with nobody near, MIrs.
Bute hnd made more than one assault upon her, to induce her to nlter her
will. But Miss Crawley's usunl terrors regarding death increased greatly
when such dismal propositions were made to her, and MIrs. RBute saw that
she mnust get her patient into cheerful spirits nnd health before she could
hope to attnin the pious object which she hmad in view. Whither to take
her was the next puzzle. The only place where she is not likely to mect
those odious Rawdons is at church, and that won't amuse her, MIrs. Bute
justly felt, : We must go and visit our beautiful suburbs of London,''
she then thought. I hear they nre the most picturcsque in the world;''
nnd so she had a sudden interest for Hampsteud, and Hornsey, and found
that Dulwich had great charms for her, and gctting her victim into her
carriage, drove her to those rustic spots, beguiling the little journeys with
conversations about Rawdon and his wife, and telling every story to the
old lady which could add to her indignation against tlis pair ofreprobates.
Perhaps Mrs. Bute pulled the string unnecessarily tight. For though
she worked upn Miss Craley to a proper dislike of her disobedient nephew,
the invnlid had a great hatred and seceret terror of her vietimizer, and
pantel to escape from her. After a brief space, she rebelled agninst High-
gute and Iornsey ntterly. She would go into the Park. MIrs. Bute knew
they would meet the abominuble Rawdon there, and she was right. One
day in the ring, Ruwdon's stanhope came in sight; Rebecen was seated by
him. In the enemy's equipage Miss Cruwley oecupied her usual place,
A NOVEIL WITEOUT A HER0.

with Mrs. Bute on her left, the poodle and Miss Briggs on the back sceat.
It wuas a nervous moment, and ebeccn's heart beat quick as she recognised
the curriage; and as the two vehicles crossed each other in the line, she
clasped her hands, and looked towards the spinster with n fnee of agonised
attachment and devotion. Rnwdon himself tremble, and his face grew.
purple behind his dyed mustachios. Only old HBriggs wvas moved in the
other carriage, and cast her great cyes nervously towards her oll friends.
Miss Crawley's bomet was resolutely turned towards the erentine. MIrs,
Bute happened to be in ecstacics with the poodle, nnd was culling him a
little darling, and a sweet little zoggy, and a pretty pet. The carriages
muoved on, each in his line.
 Done, by Jove,'' Rawdon snid to his wife.
 Try oncee more, Rawdon,'' Rebecca answered, '`Coull not you loek your
wheels into theirs, dearest ''
Rawdon had not the heart for that maneure. When the carriages
met agin, he stood up in his stanhope; he raisel his hand ready to loff
his hat; he looked with all his eyes. Iut this time Miss Crnwley's face
was not turned away; she and MIrs. Bute looked him full in the face, and
cut their nephew pitilessly. He sank back in his sent with an oath, and
striking out of the ring, dashed away desperately homewards.
It was a gallant and deded triumph for Mrs. lBute. lBut she felt the
danger of many such meetings, as she saw the evident nervousness of Miss
Crawley; and she determined that it was most necessnry for her denr
friend's health, that they slould lenve town for a while, and reconunended
Brighton very strongly.

liamDobbin found himself the great
promoter, arranger, and manager of
the match between George Osborne
and Amelia. But for him it never
would have taken place: he could
not but confess as much to hiself,
and smiled rather bitterly ns he
thought that he of all men in the
world should be the person upon
whom the care of this marriage had
fuallen. But though indeed the con-
ductingof this negotiationwas about
as painful a task as could be set to
him, yet when he had a duty to
perform, Captain Dobbin was accus-
tomed to go through it without
many words or much hesitation;
and, having made up his mind completely, that if Mfiss Sedley was balked
of her husband she would die of the disappointment, he was determined to
use all his best enlenvours to keep her alive.
I forbeuar to enter into minute particulars of the interview between
George and Mmelia, when the former was brought back to the feet (or
should we venture to say the arms) of his young mistress by the inter-
vention of his friend honest William. A much harder heart than George's
would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly ravaged by
grief and despair, and at the simple tender accents in which she told her
little broken-hearted story: but as she did not faint when her mother,
trembling, brought Osborne to her; and as she only gae relief to her
oercharged grief, by laying her head on her loer's shoulder and there
weeping for a while the most tender, copious, and refreshing tears-old
Mrs. Selley, too grcatly relieved, thought it was best to leave the young
persons to themselves; and so quitted Emmy crying over George's hand,
and kissing it humbly, as if it were her supreme chief and master, and as
if she were quite a guilty and unworthy person needing every favour and
grace from him.
This prostration and sweet unrepining obedience exquisitely touched
and flattered George Osborne. He saw a slave before him in that simple
yielding fithful ereature, and his soul within him thrilled secretly some-
how at the knowledge of his power. He would be generous-minded,
Bultan as he was, and raise up tlis kneeling Esther and make a queen of

her : besides, her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her sub-
mission, and so he cheered her, and raised her up and forgave her, so to
spesk. All her hopes and feelings, which were dying and withering, this
her sun having been removel from her, bloomed again and at once, its light
being restored. You would scarcely have recognised the beaming little
face upon Amelia's pillow that night as the one that was laid there the
night before, so wan, so lifeless, so careless of all round about. The
honest Irish maid-servant, delighted with the change, asked leave to
kiss the face that had grown all of a sudden so rosy. Amelia put her
arms round the girl's neck and kissel her with all her heart, like a child.
She was little more. She had that night a sweet refreshing sleep, like
one-and what a spring of inexpressible hnppiness as she woke in the
morning sunshinel
He will be here agsin to-dny,'' Amelia thought.  Hc is the greatest
and bestof men.'' Aud the fact is, that George thought he was one of the
generousest creutures alive: and that he was making u tremendous
saecrifice in marrying this young creature.
While she and Osborne were huving their delightful tete-a-tte above
stairs, old Mrs. Sedley and Captain Dobbin were conversing elow upon
the state of the affairs, and the chances and future arrangements of tha
young people. Mrs. Sedley having brought the two lovers together and
left them embrcing each other with all their might, like a true womn,
was of opinion that no power on earth would induce Mr, Sedlcy to consent
to the match between his daughter and the son of n man who had so
shamefully, wickedly, and monstrously tretel him. MAnd she told a long
story about happier days and their earlier splendours, when Osborne lived
in a very humble way in the New Road, und his wife was too lad to
receive some of Jos's little bnby things, with which Mrs. Sedley aoeom-
modated her at the birth of one of Osborne's own children. The fiendish
ingratitude of that man, she was sure, had broken Mr. S.'s heart: and as
for a marriage, he would never, never, uever, nerer consent.
 They must run away together, Mla'am,'' Dobbin snid, lughing, '`'and
follow the example of Captain Rawdon Crawley, and Miss Emmy's frieud
the little governess,'' Was it possible? Well sle neverl Mres. Sedley
was all excitement about this news. She wished that Blenkinsop were
here to hear it : Blenkinsop always mistrusted that Miss Sharp.-What an
escape Jos hnd hadl and she described the alrealy well-known love-
passages between Rehecca and the Collector of Boggleywollh.
It was not, however, Mr. Selley's wrath which Dobbin feared, so much
as that of the other parent concerned, and he owned that he had a very
oonsiderable doubt and anxiety respecting the belaviour of the black-
hrowed old tyrant of a Russia merchant in llussell Square. IIe has for-
bilden the mateh peremptorily Dobbin thought. He knew what u savage
determined man Osborne was, and how he stuck by his word. The only
chance George has of reeoncilement,'' argued his friend, `` is by distinguish-
ing himself in the coming campaign. If he dies they both go together. If
he fils in distinction-what thenP He has some money from his mother,
I have heard-enough to purchase his majority-or he must sell out and
go and dig in Canada or rough it in a cottage in the country,'' With such

a partner Dobbin thought he would not mind Siberia-and, strange to say,
this absurd and utterly imprudent young fellow never for a moment con-
sidered that the want of means to keep a nice carriage and horses, and of
an income which should enable its possessors to entertain their friends
genteelly, ought to operate as bars to the union of George and Miss Sedley.
It was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the
marriage shonld take place as quickly as possible. Was he anxious him-
self, I wonder, to have it over?-as people, when dentl has occurred, like
to press forward the funeral, or when a parting is resolved upon, hasten it.
It is certain that Mr, Dobbin, having taken the matter in hand, was most
extraorlinarily eager in the conduet of it. He urged on George the
neecessity of immediate nction : he showed the chances of reconciliation
with his futher, which a favourable meution of his name in the Gazette
must bring about. If need were he would go himself and brue botl the
fathers in the business. At all events, he besought George to go through
with it before the orders came, which everybody expected, for the
departure of the regiment from Lngland on foreign service.
Bent upon these hymeneal projects, and with the applause and consent
of Mrs, Sedley, who did not care to break the matter personally to her
usband, Mr. Dobbin went to seek John Sedley at his house otf call in thce
City, the Tapioca Coffee-house, where, since his own offices wuere shut up,
nnd fnte had overtaken him, the poor brokn-owvn old gentlean used to
betake imself daily, and write letters and reeeive them, and tie them u
into mysterious bundles, several of which he carried in the llaps of his coat.
I don't know anything more dismal than that business and bustle and
mystery of a ruined man: those letters from tl wcalthy which he shows
you: those worn gseasy doeuments promising support and ollering con-
dolence which he plaes wi.-tfully before yo, and on wich he builds his
hopes of restoration md liture fortune. Mly beloved reader has no doubt
in the course of his experience been waylaid by many such a luckless com-
panion. IIe tkes you into the corner; he has his bundle of papers out
of his gaping coat pocket ; and the tape off, and the string in lis mouth,
and the favourite letterse slected and laid before you; and ho docs ot
know the sad eager half-crazy look which he fixes on you with his
hopeless eyes
Changed into a man of this sort, Dobbin found the once florid, jovial,
and prosperous John Selley. IIis coat, that used to be so glossy and trim,
was white at the seams, and the buttons showed the copper. His face
had fallen in, and wes unshorn ; his frill and neckcloth hung limp under
his bagging waisteost. When he used to treat the boys in old days at a
oofee-house, he would shout and laugh louder than anybody there, and
hae all the waiters skipping ronnd him; it was quite painful to see how
humble and civil he was to Joh of the Tpioca, a blear-eyed old attendant
in dingy stockings and cracked pumps, whose business it was to serve
glasses of wafers, and bumpers of ink in pewter, and slices of paper to the
frequenters of this dreary house of entertainment, where nothing else
seemed to e consumed.  As for William Dobbin, whom he had tipped
repeatedly in his youth, and who had been the old gentleman's butt on a
thousand occasions, old Sedley gnve his hand to him in a very hesitating

humble manner now, nd called him ``Sir.'' A feeling of shame and remorse
took possession of William Dobbin as the broken old man so received and
addressed him, as if he himself had been somehow guilty of the misfor-
tunes which had brought Sedley so low.
I am very glad to see you, Captain Dobbin, Sir,'' says he, after a
kulking look or two at his visitor (whose lanky figure and military appear-
ance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the blear eyes of the
waiter in the cracked dancing pumps, and awakened the old lady in black,
who losed among the mouldy old coffee-cups in the bar). ` How is the
worthy alderman, and my lady, your excellent mother, Sir'' He looked
round at the wniter as he said, ``My lndy,'' as much as to say, '`Hark ye,
John, I have friends still, and persons of rank and reputation, too.'' Are
you come to do anything in nmy way, sir My young friends Dale and
Bpiggot do ull my business for me now, until my new offices are ready
f6r I'm only here temporarily, you know, Captain. What can we do for
you, sir Will you like to take anythingP''
Dobbin, with a great lel of hesitation and stuttering, protestel that
he was not in the lenst hungry or thirsty; that he had no business to
trasact; that he only came to nsk if Mr. Sedley wns well, and to shake
hands with an old friend; and, he added, witb a desperate perversion of
truth, `` My mother is very well-that is, she's been very unwell, and is
only waiting for the first fine day to go out and call upon Mrs. Sedley.
How is Mrs. Sedley, Sir I hope she's quite well,'' And here he paused,
relecting on his own eonsummate hypocrisy; for the day was as fine, and
the sunshine as bright as it cver is in Cotlin Court, where the Tapiocea
Cofee-house is situated; and Mr. Dobbin remembered that he had seen
Mrs. Sedley himself only an hour hefore, having driven Osborne down to
Fulham in his gig, and left him there tete-a-te with Miss Amelia.
My wife will be ery happy to see her ladyehip,'' Sedley replied,
pulling out his papers. : I'e a very kind letter here from your futher,
Bir, and beg my respectful compliments to him. Lady D. will find us in
rather a smaller house thnn wc were accustomcd to receive our friends in;
but it's sug, and the change of air does good to my dnughter, who was
suffering in town rather-you remember little lEmmy, Sir P-yes, suffering
a good deal.'' The old gentleman's eyes were wandering as he spoke,
anl he was tliinking of something else, as he sate thrumming on his papers
and fumbling at the worn red tape.
You're a military man,'' he went on;`` I ask you, Bill Dobbin, could
any man ever have speculated upon the return of that Corsican scoundrel
from ElbaP When the allied sovereigns were here last year, and we gave
'em that dinner in the City, Sir, und we saw the emple of Concord, and

and to ruin this country. That 's why I'm here, William. That's why
my nnme 's in the Gazette. Why, Sir -because I trusted the Emperor of
Ilussia and the Prince Regent. Look here. Look at my papers. Look
what the funds were on the lst of MInrch-what the Frenchi fives were
when I bought for the aceount. Aud what they're at now. There was
collusion, Sir, or that villain never would have escaped. Where was the
English Commissioner who allowed him to get away? He ought to be

 We're goiug to hunt Boney out, Sir,'' Dobbin said, rather alarmed at
the fury of the old man, the vcins of whose forelead began to swell, and
who sate drumming his papers with his clenchel fist.  We are going to
hunt him out, Sir-the Duke 's in Belgium already, and we expect march-
ing orders every day.''
`Give him no quarter. Bring back the villain's head, Sir. Shoot the
coward down, Sir,'' Sedley roared. I'd enlist myself, by -; but I'm
a broken old man-ruined by that damned scoundrel-and by a parcel of
swindling tieves in this country whom I made, Sir, and who are rolling
in their carringes now,'' he added, with a break in his voice.
Dobbin was not a little affected by the sight of this onee kind old friend,
crazed almost with misfortune and raving with senile unger. Pity the
fallen gentleman: you to whom money and fair repute are the cliefest
good; and so, surely, are they in Vanity Fair.
 Yes,'' he continued, '` there are some vipers that you warm, and they
sting you afterwards. There are some beggurs that you put on horseback,

Dobbin, my boy. I mean a purse-proud villain in Russell Square, whom

he was when I befriended him.''
I have heard something of this, Sir, from my friend George,'' Dobbin
said, anxious to come to his poiut.  The quarrel between you and his father
has cut hin up a great deal, Sir. Indeed, I'm tle bearer of a message
from him.''

There's no reason she should die or live miserably because you are wrong-
headed. To my thinking she 'as just as much married as if the banns had
been read in all the churches in London. And what better answer can
there be to Osborne's charges against you, as charges there are, than that
his son elaims to enter your family and marry your daughterP''
A light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old Sedley
as this point was put to him: but he still persisted that with his consent
the marriage between Amelia and George should never take place.
We must do it without,'' Dobbin suid, smiling, and told Mr. Sedley, as
he had told Mrs. Sedley in the day, before, the story of Rebecca's elopement
with Captain Craswley. It evidently amused the old gentleman. ` You're
terrible fellows, you Captains,'' said he, tying up his papers; and his face
wore somnething like a smile upon it, to the astonishment of the blear-
eyed waiter who now entered, and had never seen such an expresslon upon
Sedley's countenance since he had used the dismal coffee-house.
The idea of hitting his enemy Osborne such a blow soothed, perhaps,
the old gentleman : and, their colloquy presently ending, he and Dobbin
parted pretty good friends.

lughing. ``How they must set off her complexionl A perfect illumina-
tion it must be when her jewels are on her neek. Ier jet-black hair is

George, in conversation with hmelia, was rallying tle appearance of a
3oung lady of whom his father and sisters lad lately made the acquaint-
enee, and who was an objeet of vast respect to the Russell Square family.
She was reported to have l don't know how many plantations in the West
Indies; a deal of money in the funds; and three stars to her name in

the East India stockholders' list. She had a mansion in Surrey, and a
house in Portlnnd Place. The name of the rieh West India heiress had
been mentioned with applause in the Morning Post. Mrs. Haggistoun,
Colonel Hggistoun's widow, her relative, `` chaperonel'' her, and kept her
house. She was just from sehool, where she hal eompleted her education,
and George and his sisters had met her at an evening party at old Hulker's
house, Deonshire Place (Hulker, Bullocek, & Co. were long the correspon-
dents of her house in the West Indies), and the girls had made the most
cordinl advanees to her, wlich the hciress had reeeived with great good
humour. An orphan in her position-with her money-so interestingl
the Misses Osborne asaid. They were full of their new friend when they
returned from the Hulker ball to Miss Wirt, their companion: they had
male arrangements for continually meeting, and had the carriage aud
drove to see her the very next dsy. Mrs. IHaggistoun, Colonel Haggiae-
toun's widow, a relation of Lorl Binkie, and always talking of him, struck
tle dear unsophisticasted girls as rather haughty, and too much inclined to
talk about her great relations: but Rhoda was everything they could wish
--tle frankest, kindest, most agreeable creature-wanting a little polish,
but so good-natured. The girls Christian-named eaeh other at once.
You should have seen her dress for court, Emmy,'' Osborne cried,
laughing. ' She came to my sisters to show it of, before she was pre-
sented in state by my Lady Binkie, the Haggistoun's kinswoman. She'a
related to every one, that Haggistoun. Her diamonds blazed out like Vaux-
hall on the night we were there. (Do you remember Vauxhall, Lmmy,
and Jos singing to his dearest diddls iddle arling) Diamonds and
mahoguny, my deurl think what an advantageous contrast-and the white
feathers in her hair-I mean in her wool. he had ear-rings like chande-
liers; you might hare lighted 'em up, by Jove-and a yellow satin train
that streeled after her like the tail of a comet.''
'How old is she'' asked Emmy, to whom George was rattling away
regarding this dark paragon, on the morning of their re-union-rattling
away as no other man in the world surely could.
Wly, the Black Prineess, tlough she has only just left school, must
be two or three and twenty. And you shotld see the hand she writesl
Mrs. Coloncl Haggistoun usuully writes her letters, but in a moment of
confidence, she put pen to paper for my sisters; shs spelt satin satting,
and Suint James's, aint Jams.''
 Why, surely it must be Miss Swarts, the parlour border,'' Emmy
said, remembering that good-natured young Mulatto girl, who had been
so hysterically affeetel when Amelia left Miss Pinkerton's academy.
The very nae,'' George said.  Her father was a Gorman Jew-s
slave-owner they say-connected with the Cannibal Islands in some way
or other. HIe died last year, and Miss Pinkerton has finished her educa-
tion. Bhc can play two pieces on the piano; she knows three songs; she
can write when Mrs. Haggistoun is by to spell for her; and Jane and
MInria already have got to love her as a sister.''
eI wish they would hae loved me,'' said Emmy, wistfully.  They
were always very cold to me.''
My dear child, they would have loved you if you had hadl two hundred

thousand pounds,'' George replied. ``That is the way in which they have
been brought up. Ours is a ready-oney society. We live among
bankers and city big-wigs, and be hangced to them, and eery man, as he
talks to you, is jingling his guineas in his pocket. There is that jackass
Fred Bullock, is going to mrry Maria-there 's Goldmore, the Eust India
Director, there 's Dipley, in the tallow trade-our trade,'' George said,
with an uneasy laugh and a blush. ``Curse the whole pack of money-
grubbing vulgariansl I fall asleep at tleir great hevy dinners. I feel
ashamed in my father's great stupid parties. I'vo been accustomed to live
with gentlemen, and men of the world and fashion, mmy, not with a
parcel of turtle-fed tradesmen. Deuar little womnn, you are the only person
of our set who ever looked, or thought, or spoke like a lady: and you do
it becsuse you 're an angel and can't help it. Don't remonstrate. ou are
the only lady. Didn't Miss Crawley remark it, who has liel in the bcst
company in Lurope And as for Crawley, of the Life Guars, hang it,
he 's a fine fellow: and I like lim for marrying the girl hc had chosen.''
Amelia almirel Mr. Crawley very much, too, for this; and trusted
Rebecca would be happy with him, und hoped (with a laugh) Jos would
be consoled. And so the pair went on prattling, as in quite carly days.
Amelia's confidenee being perfcctly restored to her, though she cxprcssed
a great denl of pretty jeulousy about Miss Swartz, and professed to be
dreadfully frightened-like a hypocrite as she was-lest George should
forget her for the heiress and her money anl her estates in Saint Kitts.
But the fact is, she was a great deal too happy to have fears or doubts or
misgivings of any sort: and having George at her side again, was not
afraid of any hciress or beauty, or indeed of any sort of danger.
When Captain Dobbin camc back in the afternoon to these people-
which he did with a great deal of sympathy for them-it did his lenrt
goaod to see how Amelia had grown young again-how she laughel, and
chirped, and sang familiar old songs at the piano, whicl wcre only inter-
rupted by the bell from without proclaiming Mr. Sedley's returu from the
City, before whom George received a signul to retreat.
Beyond thc first smile of recognition-and even that was an hypoerisy,
for she thought his arrivul rather provoking-Miss Selley did not once
notice Dobbin luring his visit. But he wus content, so thnt he saw her
happy; and thankful to huve been the means ol making hcer so.

There is little doubt that old Oborne believedl all he said, and that the
girls were quite enrnest in their protestations of affection for Miss Swurtz.
People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally. If thc
simplest people are disposed to look not a little kindly on great Prosperity,
(for I defy any member of the British public to say that the notion of
Wealth has not something awful and pleasing to him; and you, if you are

society. They give a loose to their feelings on proper occasions. And
the proof is, that the major part of tle Osborne family, who had not, in
fifteen years, been able to get up a hearty regard for Amelia Sedley, became
as fond of Miss Swnrtz in the course of a single evening nus the most
romantic advocate of friendship at first-sight could desire.
What a match for George she'd be (the sister and Miss Wirt agreed),
and how much bettcer than that insignificant little Amelial Such a
dashing young fellow as he is, with his good looks, rank, and accomplish-
ments, would be the very husband for her. Visions of balls in Portland
Place, presentations at Court, and introductions to half the peerage, filled
the minds of the young ladies; who talked of nothing but George and his
grand acquaintances to their beloved new friend.
Old Osborne thought she would be a great match, too, for his son. He
should leave the army; hc should go into Parliament ; he should cut a
figure in the fashion and in the state. His blood boiled with honest
British exultation, as he saw the name of Osborne ennoble in the person
of his son, and thought that he might be the progenitor of a glorious line
of bnronets. He worked in the City and on 'Change, until he knew
everything relating to the fortuue of the heiress, how her money was
placed, nnd where her estates lay. oung Frel Bullock, one of his chief
informants, would have liked to make a bid for her himself (it was so the
young banker expressed it), only he was bookel to Mnrin Osborne. But
not being able to secure her as a wife, the disinterested Fred quita
npproved of her as a sister-in-lnw. 'Let George cut in directly and win
her,'' was his adice. Strike while the iron's hot, you know-while
he's fresh to the town; in n few weeks some d- fellow from the West
End will come in with a title and a rotten rent-roll and cut all us City
men out, as Lorl Fitzrufus did last year with Miss Grogram, who was
actually engaged to Podder, of Podder & Brown's. The sooner it is done
the better, Mr. Osborne; them's my sentiments,'' the wag said; tlough,
when Osborne had loft the bank parlour, Mr. Bullock remembcred Mmelia,
nnd what a pretty girl she was, and how attached to Gcorge Osborne; and
he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuablce time to regrctting the
misfortune which hud befallen tlat unlucky young woman.
WVhile thus George Osborne'a good feelings, and his good friend and
genius, Dobbin, were carrying back the truant to Amelia's feet, George's
parent and sisters were nrranging this splendid match for him, which they
never dreamed he would resist.
When the elder Osborne gave what he cnllel ``n hint,'' there was no
possibility for the most obtuse to mistake his meaning. Hc called kicking
a footman down stairs, n hint to the latter to leave his service. With his
usual frankness and delicascy, he told Mrs. Haggistoun that he would give
her a check for ten thousand pouuds on the dy his son was married to
her wnrd; and called that proposal a hint, and considered it a very dexs-
terous piece of diplomacy. He gave George finally such another hint
regarding the heiress; and ordered him to marry her out of hand, as he
would have ordered his butler to draw a cork, or his clerk to write a
letter.
IThis imperatie hint disturbed George a good deal. He was in th

very frst enthusiasm and delight of his second courtship of Amelia, which
wns inexpressibly sweet to him. The contrast of her manners and appear-
ance with those of the heiress, made the iden of a union with the latter
appear doubly ludicrous and odious. Cnrriages and opera-boxes, thought
he; fancy being seen in them by the side of such a mahogany charmer as
thatl Add to all, that the Junior Osborne was quite as obstinate as the
Senior: when he wanted a thing, quite as firm in his resolution to get
it; and quite as violent when angered, as his father in his most stern
Imoments.
On the first dny when his father formally gave him the hint that he wgs
to place his affections at Miss Swartz's feet, George temporised with the
old gentlcman.  You should have thought of the matter sooner, Sir,''
he said. ` It cnn't be done now, when we're expecting cvery day to go
on foreign service. Wnit till my return, if I do return;'' and then he
represented, that the time wlen the regiment was daily expecting to quit
England, was exeeedingly ill-chosen : that the few days a week during
which they were still to remain nt home, mst be deoted to business and
not to love-making: time enough for tht when he came home with his
majority; '` for, I promise you,'' suidhe, with n satisfied air, ``that one way
or other you shall read the name of George Oborne in the Gazette.''
The futher's reply to this was founded upon the information whic he
had got in the City: that the Weat End chaps would infallibly cntch hold
of the heiress if any delay took plae: tat if he didn't marry Miss S., he
might at least have an engagement in writing, to come into effect when he
returned to England ; and that a man who could get ten thousand a year
by staying at home, was a fool to risk his life abronad.
So that you would have me shown up as a coward, Sir, and our name
lishonoured for the sake of Miss Swartz's money,'' George iuterposed.
This remark staggerel the old gentleman; but as he had to reply to it,
and as his mind wns neertheless made up, he said, ` You will dine here
to-morrow, Sir, and every day Miss Swartz comes, you will be here to puy
your respects to her. If you wunt for mouey, call upon Mr. Chopper.''
Thus a new obstacle was in George's wny, to interfere with his plans
regarding Amelia; and about which he and Dobbin had more than one
confidential consultation. 1Iis friend's opiuon respecting the line of
conduct which he ought to pursue, we know already. And as for Osborne,
when he was once bent on a thing, a fresh obstacle or two only rendered
him the more resolute.
The dnrk object of the conspiracy into which the chiefs of the Osborne
family had entered, was quite ignorant of all their plans regarding her
(which, strange to say, her friaend and chperon did not divulge), and,
taking all the young ladies' flattery for genuine sentiment, and being, as
we ave before had occasion to show, of n very warm and impetuous
nature, responded to their aflection with quite a tropical ardour. And if
the truth may be told, I dare say that she too had some selfish attraction
in the Russell Square house; and in a word, tlought George Osborne a
very nice young man. His whiskers had made an impression upon her,
on the very first night she beheld them at the ball at Messrs. lulkers; and,

as we know, she was not the first woman who hud been charmed by them.
George had an air at once swaggering and melancholy, languid and fierce.
He looked like a man who hnd passions, secrets, and private harrowing
griefs and adventures. Hlis voice was rich and deep. Ie would sny it
was a warm evening, or ask his partner to take an ice, with a tone as sad
and confidential as if he were breaking her mother's deatl to her, or pre-
luding a declaration of love. He trampled over all the young bucks of
his father's circle, and was tle hero among those third-rate men. Some
few sneered at him nnd lated him. Some, like Dobbin, fanatically
admirel him. And his whiskers had begnn to do their work, and to curl
themselves round the affections of Miss Swartz.
Whenever there was a chnce of meeting him in Russell Square, that
simple and good-natured young woman was quite in a flurry to see her
dear Mliss Osbornes. She went to great expenses in new gowns, and
bracelets, and bonnets, and in prodigious feathers. She adorned ler
persou with her utmost skill to please the Conqueror, and exhibited all
her simple aceomplishments to win his favour. The girls would ask her,
with the greatest gravity, for a little music, and she wonld sing her three
songs and play her two little pieces as often as ever thcy asked, and with
an always increasing pleasure to herself. During these delectable enter-
tainments, Miss Wirt and the chapern ste by, and conned over the
peerage, and talked about the nobilitye
Thce dny after George hnl his hion his fther, and a short time
before the hour of dinner, he was lolling upon a sofa i the drawing-room
in a very becoming and perfectly natural attitude of mielancholy. He had
been, at his father's request, to Mr. Choppcr in thc city, (the old gentlc-
man, though he gave reat sums to his son, would never specify any fixed
allowance for lim, uand rewardel him only as he was in the humour). Ile
had then been to pass three hours with Anelia, his denr little Amelia, at
Fulham; and he came home to find his sisters spread in starched muslin
in the drawing-room, the dowvagcrs wckling in the back-ground, and
honest Bwartz in hcr faorite mber-loured satin, with turquoise-
bracelets, countiess rings, lowers, teathers, and all sorts of tags and gim-
cracks, abont as clegautly ecoratel :s a se chimney-sweep on May day.
The girls, after vain attempls to cage him in conversation, talked
about fashions and the lst drawing-room until he was perfectly sick of
their chatter. He contrasted their behavionr with little Emmy's,-their
shrill cracked voices with her tender ringing tones; their attitudes and
their elbows and tli starch, with her humble soft movements and
modest graces. Poor Swartz was seate in a place where Emmy had
been aeustomed toe sit. Her bejewelled nnds lay sprawling in her amber
satin ip. `Her tags and ear-rings twinkled, and her big eyes rolled about.
he was doing nothing with perfect contentment, and thinking herself
charming. hAnything so becoming as the santin the sisters had neer seen.
``DDammy,'' George said to a confidential friend, `` she looked like a
China doll, which has nothing to do all day but to grin and wag its
heal. By Jove, Will, it was all I could do to prevent yself from throwing
the sofa cushion at her,'' He rcstrained thut exlibition of sentiment,
however.

the words.'' It was the last of the worthy young woman's collection.
O, Fleue du Tage,'' Miss Maria cried; '' we have the song,'' and went
to fetch the book in which it was.
Nos it happened that this song, then in the height of the fashion, had
been given to the young ladies by a young friend of theirs, whose name was
on the title, and Miss Swartz, having concluded the ditty with George's
applause, (for he remembered that it was a favourite of Amelia's), was
hoping for an encore perhaps, and fidling with the leaves of the music,
when her eye fell upon the title, and she saw ``Amelia Sedley'' written in
the corner.

``is it my hAmelias Amelia that was nut Miss P.'s at Hammersmith I

Don't mention her,'' MIiss Marina Osborne said hastily.  Her family
' has disgraeed itself. Her father cheted papa, anl as for her, she is neer

ness about the Buttle of Prague.
''Are you a friend of Amelia's?'' George said, bouneig up. 'God

rage, and eyes like hot eols.
Though George hal stopped in his sentence, yet, his blood being up, he
was not to be cowed y all the generations of Osborne ; rallying instantly,
he replied to the bullying look of his futher, with another so indicative of
resolution and defiance, that the elder man quailed in his turn, and looked
away. He felt that the tussle was coming. Mrs. kaggistoun, let me
take you down to dinner,'' he said. Give your arm to Miss Swartz,
George,'' and they marched.

lies,'' Osborne sail to his partner; and during all the dinner, eorge
rttled on with a volubility which surprised himself, and made his father
doubly nervous, for the fight which was to take place as soon as the ladies
were gone.
The difference between the pair was, that while the fuather was violent
and a bully, the son had thrice the nerve and courage of the parent, and
could not merely make an attack, but resist it; and finding that the
mOmnent was now come when the contest between him aud his father was
to be dlecided, he took his dinner with perfect coolness and appetite before
the engagement begn. Old Osborne, on the contrary, was nervous, and
drank much. He floundered in his conversation with the ladies, his
neighbours; George's coolness only rendering him more angry. It made
him half mad to see the calm way in which George, flapping his napkin,
and with a swaggering bow, opened the door for the ladies to leuve the
room; and filling himself a glass of wine, smacked it, and looked his father

began. ` How dare you, Sir, mention that person's name before Miss
Swartz to-day, in my drawing-room I ask you, ir, how dare you do
it
`:Stop, Sir,'' says George, '`don't say dare, Sir. Dare isn't a word to
be used to a Captain in the British Army.''
I shall say what I like to my son, WSir. I can cut him of with a shil-
ling if I like. I can make him a beggar if I like. Iill sy what I like,''
the elder said.
I'm a gentleman though I am your son, Sir,'' George answered
haughtily. ``Any communications which you have to make to me, or
any orders which you may pleuse to gie, I beg may be couched in that
kind of language which I am accustomed to hear,''
Wheneer the lad assumed his haughty manner, it always created either
great awe or great irritation in the parent. Old Osborne stood in seeret
terror of his son as a better gentleman than himself; and perhaps my
readers may hae remarked in their experience of this Vanity Fair of ours,
that there is no character which a low-minded man so much mistrusts, as
that of a gentleman.
`My father didn't give me the education you have had, nor the advan-
tages you have had, nor the money you hae had. If I had kept the
eompany some folks have had through my meane, perhaps my son wouldn't
have any reason to brag, Dir, of lis sperioriy and Hest IEud airs (these
words were nttered in the elder Osborne's most sarcastic tones). But it
wasn't cnsidered the part of a gentleman, in my time, for a man to insult
his father. If I'd done any suoh thing, mine would have kicked me
down stairs, Sir,''
`I neer insulted you, Sir. I snid I begged you to remember your son
was a gentleman as wcll as yourself. I know very well that you give me
plenty of money,'' snid George, (fingering a bundle of notes which he had
got in the morning from Mr. Chopper).  ou tell it me often enough,
ir. Thcre's no fear of my forgetting it.''
I wish you'd remember other things as well, Sir,'' the sire answered.
tI wish you'd remember that in this house-so long as you choose to
onour it with your copany, Captain-I'm the master, and that name,
and thuat that-that you-that I say-

It wasn't I, Sir, that introdueed Miss Sedley's name. It was my
sisters who spoke ill of her to Miss Swartz; and by Jove I'll defend her
whereverIgo. Nobody shall speak lightly of tlat name in my presenoe.
Our family has done her quite enough injury already, I think, und may
leave off reviling her now she's down. I'll shoot any man but you who

I obeyed you. And now that her heart 's miue you give me orders to fling

It's a shame, by Heavens,'' sid George, working himself up into passion
nnd enthusiasm as he proceeded, '` to play at fast and loose with a young
girl's affections-and with such an angel as that-one so superior to the

Mr. Osborne pulled frantically at the cord by which e was accustomed

face, ordered that functionary to call a concl for Cnptain Osborne.

NEMIES the most obstinate and cou-
rageous cnn't hold out against starva-
tion: so the elder Osborne felt himself
pretty easy about his adversary in the
encounter we have just described ; and
as soon as George's supplies fell
short, confidently expected his un-
conditional submission. It was un-
lucky, to be sure, that the lad should
have secured na stock of provisions on
the very day when the first encounter
took place; but this relief was only
temporary, old Osborne thought, and
would but delay George's surrender.
No communication passed between
father and son for some days. The
former was sulky at this silence, but
not disquieted ; for, as he said, he knew where he could put the screw
upon George, and only waited the result of that operation. He told the
sisters the upshot of the dispute between them, but ordered them to take
no notice of the matter, and welcome George on his return as if nothing
had happened. His cover was laid as usual every day, and perhaps the
old gentleman rather anxiously expected him; but he never came. Some
one inquired at the Slaughter'as regarding him, where it was said that he
and lis friend Captain Dobbin had left town.
One gusty, raw day at the end of April,-the rain whipping the
puvement of that ancient street where the old Slaughter's Coffee-house
was once situated,-Gcorge Osborne came into the coffee-room, looking
very haggard and pale; although dressed rather smartly in a blue coat
nnd brass buttons, and a neat buff waistcoat of the fashion of those days.
Here was his friend Captain Dolbin, in blue and brass too, having aban-
loned the military frock and French-grey trowsers, which were the usual
coverings of his lanky person.
Dobbin had been in the coffee-room for an hour or more. He had
tried nall the papers, but could not read them. He had looked at the
clock many scores of times; and at the street, where the rain was pattering
down, and the people as they clinked by in pattens, left long reflections
on the shining stones: he tattooed at the table: he bit his nails most
completely, and nearly to the quick (he was accustomed to ornament his
great big hands in this way): he balanced the tea-spoon dexterouly on

the milk jug: upset it, &c. &c.; and in fuact showed those signs of dis-
tuietude, and practised those desperate attempts at amusemcnt, which
men are accustomed to employ when very anxious, and expectant, and
perturbed in mind.
Some of his comrades, gentlemen who used the room, joked him about
the splendour of his costume and his agitation of manner. One asked
him if he was going to be married Dobbin laughed, anl said he would
send his aequaintance (Mjor Wagstaff, of the Engineers) a picce of cuke,
when that event took place. At length Captain Osbore made his appear-
ance, very smartly dressed, but very pale and agitated, as we lave said.
Ie wiped his pale face with a large yellow bandnnna pocket-handkerchief
that was prodigiously scented. He shook hands with Dobbin, looked at
the clock, nnd told John, the waiter, to bring him some curaoa. Of this
eordial he swallowed off a couple of glasses with nervous engerness. His
friend asked with some interest about his health.
Couldn't get a wink of sleep till daylight, Dob,'' said he.  Infernal
headache and fever. Got up at nine, and went down to the Hummums
for a bath. I say, Dob, I feel just as I did on the morning I wvent out
with Rocket at uebec.''
`So do I'' William responded. I was a deuced deal more nervrous
than you were that morning. Kou made a famous breukfast, I reember.
Eaut somcthing now.''
You 're s good old fellow, Will,. I 'Il drink your health, old boy, anl
farewell to--''
No, no; two glasses are enough,'' Dobbin interrupted him. ``Hero,
take away the liqueurs, JIohn. HIave some cayenne-pepper with your
fowl. Mke haste thougl, for it is time we were there.''
It was about half-an-hour from twelve when this brief meeting and
colloquy took place between the two captains. A coach, into which Cn-
tain Osborne's servant put his master's desk and dressing-case, had been
in waiting for some time; and into tlis the two gentlemen hurried under
an umbrella, and the valet mounted on the box, cursing the rain and the
dampness of the coachman who was steaming beside him.  We shall
find a better trap than this at the chutch-door,'' says he; `` that's a com-
frt.'' And the carriage drove on, taking the road down Piccadilly,
where Apsley House and St. George's Hospital wore red jackets still;
where there were oil-lamps; where Achilles was not yet born; nor the
Pimlico arch raised; nor the hideous equestria monster which pervades
it and the neighbourhood ;-and so they drove down by Brompton to a
certain chapel near the Fulham rond there.
A chariot was in waiting with four lorses; likewise a coach of the kind
called glass coaches. Only a very few idlers were collected on account of
the dismal dismal rain.
Hang itl'' said George, ``'I said only a pair,''
`My master would have four,'' said Mr. Joseph Selley's serant, who
was in waiting; and he and Mr. Osborne's mnn agreed as they followed
George and William into the chureh, that it was a ``reg'lar shabby turn
hout ; and with scarce so much as a breakfast or a wedding faviour,''
 Here you are,'' said our old friend, Jos Sedley, comiug forward.
188
Y1NITY AIR.
 You 're five minutes late, George, my boy. What a day, ehP Demmy,
it 's like the commeneement of the rainy season in Bengal. But you'll
find my carriage is water-tight. Come along, my mother and Emmy are
in the vestry.''
Jos Sedley was splendid. He was fatter than ever. His shirt collars
were higher ; his face was redder; his shirt-frill flaunted gorgeously out of
his variegated waistcoat. Varnished boots were not invented ns yet; but
the Hessians on his beautiful legs shone so, that they must lave been the
identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture used to shave
himself; aud on his light green coat there bloomed a fine wedding favour,
like a great white spreading magnolia.
In a word, George had tlrown the great cast. He was going to be
mnrried. Hence his pallor and nervousnesas-his sleepless night mnd
agitation in the morning. I have heard people who have gone through
the same thung own to the samce emotion. Mfter three or four ceremonies,
you get accustomed to it, no doubt; but the first dip, every body allows,
is awful.
The bride was dressed in a brown silk pelisse, (as Captain Dobbin has
since informed me), and wore a straw bonnet with a pink rihbon: over the
bonnet she had a veil of white Chantilly lace, a gift from Mr. Joseph
Sedley, ler brother. Captain Dobbin himself had asked leave to present
er with a gold chain and wteh, which she sported on this occasion ; and
her mother gave her her diamond brooch ; almost the only trinket which
was left to the old ludy. As the service went on, Mrs. Sedley sat and
whimpered a great deal in a pew, consoled by the Irish maid servant and
Mrs. Clapp from the lodgings. Old Sedley would not be present. Jos
acted for his father, giving away the bride, whilst Captain Dobbin stepped
up s groom's-man to his friend George.
There was nobody in the churcl besides the oficiating persons and the
small marriage party and their attendants. The two valets sat aloof
superciliously. The rain came rattling down on the windows. In the
intervals of the service you heard it, and the sobbing of old Mrs. Sedley
in the pew. The parson's tones echoed sadly through the empty walls.
Osborne's I will'' was sounded in very deep base. Emmy's response
came fluttering up to her lips from her heart, but was searcely heard by
anyboly except Captain Dobbin.
Wuen the service wns completed, Jos Sedley came forward and kissed
his sister, the bride, for the first time ior many months-George's look of
gloom had gone, and he seemed quite proud and radiant. ` It 's your
turn, William,'' says he, putting his hand fondly upon Dobbin's shoulder;
and Dobbin went up and touched Amelia on the cheek.
Then they went iuto the vestry and signed the register. `` God bless
you, Old Dobbin,'' George si, grasping him by the hand, with something
very like moisture glistening in his eyes. William replied only by nodding
his head. His heart was too full to say much.
e Write directly, and come down as soon as you cnan, you know,''
Osborne sid. After Mrs. Sedley had taken an hysterical adien of her
daughter, the pair went off to the crriage. ` Get out of the way, you
little devils,'' George cried to a small crowd of dmp urchins, that were

hanging about the chapel-door. The rin drove into the bride and bridc-
groom's faces as they pased to the chariot. The postillions' favours
draggled on their dripping jackets. The few children made a dismal
cheer, as the cnrriage, splashing mud, drove nwny.
William Dobbin stood in the church-porch, looking at it, a qneer figure.
The small crew of spectators jeered him. He was not thinking about
them or their laughter.
 Come home and have some tiffin, Dobbin,'' a voice cried behind him;
as a pudgy hand was laid on his shoulder, and the honest fellow's review
was interrupted. lBut the Captain had no heart to go a feasting with
Jos tiedley. e put the weeping old lady and her attendants into
the carriage along with Jos, and left them without any further words
passing. This carriage, too, drove away, and the urclins gae another
sareastical cheer.
Here, you little beggars,'' Dobbin said, givsing some sixpences amongst
them, and then went off by himself through the rain. It was all over.
They were married, and happy, he pryed God. Never since he was a
boy had he felt so miseruable and so lonely. He longcd with a heart-sick
yearning for the first few days to be ovrer, that he might see her again.
Some ten days after the above ceremony, thrse young men of our
aequaintance were enjoying that beautiful prospect of bow windows on
the one side and blue sea on the other, which Brighton affords to the
truaveller. Sometimes it is towards the ocean-smiling with countless
dimples, speekled with white sails, with a hunred bathing-mnchines kiss-
ing the skirt of his blue garment-that the Londoner looks enraptured:
sometimes, on the contrary, a lover of human nature rather than of pros-
pects of any kind, it is towards the bow windows that he turns, and
that swarm of human life which they exhibit. From one issue the notes
of a piano, which a young lady in ringlets prctises six hours daily, to the
delight of the fellow-lodgers: at another, lovely Polly, the nursemnid,
may be seen dandling Master Omnium in her arms: whilst Jncob, his
papn, is bcheld eating prawns, and devouring the Times for breakfast, at
the window below. Yonder are the Misses Leery, who are looking out for
the young officers of the heavies, who are pretty sure to be pacing the
cliff; or again it is a City man, with a nasutical turn, and a telescope, the
size of a six-pounder, who has his instrument pointed seawards, so as to
eommand every pleasure-bont, herring-boat, or bathing-machine thant
comes to, or quits, the shore, &e., &c. But hve we any leisure for a
deseription of Brighton -for Brighton, a clean Naples with genteel lazza-

 Don't brek her heart, Jos, you rasecnal,'' said another. `Don't trifle
with her affections, you Don Jun ''
eGet away,'' said Jos Sedley, quite pleased, and leering up at the maid-
servant in question with a nost killing ogle. Jos was even more splendid
nt Brighton than he had been at his sister's marriage. He had brilliant
under-waistcoats, any one of which would have set up a moderate buck.
He sported a military frock-coat, ornamented with frogs, knobs, black
buttons, and meundering embroidery. He had affectel a military appear-
ance and habits of late; and he walked with his two friends, who were of
that profession, clinking his boot-spurs, swaggering prodigiously, and
shooting death-glances at all the servant girls who were worthy to be slain.
 What shuall we do, boys, till the ladies return?'' the buck askel. The
lalies were out to Rottingdean in his carriage, on a drive. ``Let 's have a
game at billiards,'' one of lis friends said-the tall one, with lacquered
mustachios.
e No, dammy; no, Captain,'' Jos replied, rather ularmed.  No bil-
liards to-day, Crawley, my boy; yesterday was enough,''
 You play very well,'' said Crawley, laugling. ``Don't he, Osborne%

 Famous,'' Osborne said. ` Jos is a devil of a fellow nt billiards, and
at cverything else, too. I wish there were any tiger-hunting about here;
we might go and kill a few before dinner. (There goes a fine girll what
an anele, eh Jos2) Tell us that story about the tiger-hunt, and the way
you did for lim in the jungle-il's a wonderful story that, Crawley.''
Here George Osbormne gave a yawn. It 's rather slow work,'' said he,
'down here; what slall we do ''
 Shnll we go and look at some horses that Snaffler 's just brought from
Lewes fair P'' Crawley said.
``Suppose we go and have some jellies at Dutton's,'' said the rogue Jos,
willing to kill two birds with one stone.  Devilish fine gl at Dutton's.''
Suppose we go and see the Lightning come in, it 's just about time2''
George said. This advice prevailing oer the stables and the jelly, they
turned towuards the coach-office to witness the Lightning's arrival.
Ms they passed, they met the cnrriage-Jos Sedley's open carriage,
with its magnificent armorial bearings-that splendid conveyance in which
he used to drive about at Cheltenham, majestic and solitary, with his arms
foldel, and his hat cocked; or, more happy, with ladies by his side.
Two were in the cnrriage now: onc a little person, with light air,
nnd dressed in the height of the fashion; the other in a brown silk pelisse,
and a straw bonnet with pink ribbons, with a rosy, round, happy face,
thnt did you good to behold. She checked the carriage as it neared the
thrce gentlemen, after which exercise of authority she looked rather
nerous, and then begnn to blush most absurdly.  We have had a de-
lightful drive, George,'' she said, `` and-and we're so glad to come back;
and Joseph, don't let him be late.''
 Don't be leading our husbands into mischief, Mr. Sedley, you wicked,
wicked man you,'' kebeeca said, shnking at Jos a pretty little finger
covered with the neatest French kid glove. `No billiards, no smoking.
no nughtiness.''

 My dear Mrs. Crawley-Ah nowl upon my honourl'' was nll Jos
eould ejaculate by way of reply; but he managed to fall into u tolerable
attitude, with his head lying on his shoulder, grinning upwards at his
victim, with one hand at his back, which he supported on his cane, and
the other hand (the one with the diamond ring) fumbling in his shirt-frill
and among his under-waisteoats. As the carriage drove off he kissed the
diamond hand to the fair ladies within. He wished all Cheltenham, all
Chowringhee, all Calcutta, could see him in that position, waving his hand
to such a beauty, and in company with such a famous buck as Rawdon
Crawley of the Guards.
Our young bride and bridegroom had chosen Brighton as the plaee
where they would pass the first few days after their marriage:; and having
engaged apartments at the Ship Inn, enjoyed themselves there in great
comfort and quietude, until Jos presently joined them. Nor was he the
only companion they found there. As they were coming into the Hotel
from a sea-side walk one afternoon, on whom should they light but
Rebecca nd her husband. The recognition wns immediate. Rebececa
lew into the arms of her dearest friend. Crawley and Osborne shook
hands together cordially enough: and Beeky, in the course of a very few
hours, found means to make the latter forget that little unpleasant passage
of words which had happened between them. `` Do you remember the
last time we met at Miss Crawley's, when I was so rude to you, dear
Captain OsborneP I thought you seemed careless about dear Amelia.
It was that made me angry: and so pert: and so unkind: and so un-
grateful. Do forgive mel'' Rebecca said, and she held out her hand with
so frank and winning a grace, that Osborne could not but take it. By
humbly and frankly acknowledging yourself to be in the wrong, there is
no knowing, my son, what good you may do. I knew onee a gentleman,
and very worthy practitioner in Vanity Fair, who used to do little wrongs
to his neighbours on purpose, and in order to apologise for them in an
open and manly way afterwards-anl what ensuedP My friend Crocky
Doyle was liked everywhere, and deemed to be rather impetuous-but the
honestest fellow. Becky's humility passed for sincerity with George
Osborne.
These two young couples had plenty of tales to relate to each other.
-The marriages of either were discussed; and their prospects in life ca-
vassed with the greatest frankness and interest on both sides. George's
marringe was to be made known to his father by his friend Cnptain
Dobbin; and young Osborne trembled rather for the result of that com-
munication. Miss Crawley, on whom all Rawdon's hopes depended,
still held out. Unable to make an entry into her house in Park lLane,
her affectionate nephew and niece had followed her to Brighton, whera
they had emissnries continually planted at her door.
I wish you could see some of Rawdon's friends who are always about
our door,'' Rebecea said, laughing. : Did you cver see a dun, my dear;
or a bailiff and his man Iwo of the abominable wretches watched all
last week at the greengrocer's opposite, and we could not get away until
Buuday. If aunty does not relent, what slall we doP''
Rawdon, with ronrs of laughter, related a dozen amusing anecdotes
192
vFF FAIR.
of his duns, and Rebecca's adroit treatment of them. He vowed with
a great oath, that there was no woman in Europe who could talk a cre-
ditor over as she could. Almost immediately after their marriage, her
practice had begun, and her husband found the immense value of sucha
wrife. They had credit in plenty, but tley had bills also in abundanee,
and laboured under a scarcity of ready money. Did these debt-difficulties
affeet Rawdon's good spirits No. verybody in Vanity Fair must
have remarked how well those live who are comfortably and thoroughly in
debt : how they deny themselves nothing; how jolly and easy they are in
their minds. Rawdon and his wife had the very best apartments at the
inn at Brighton; the landlord, as he brought in the firt dish, bowed before
them as to his greatest customers: and llawdon abused the dinners and
wine with an audacity which no grandee in the land conld snrpass. Long
enstom, a manly appearance, faultless boots and clothes, and a happy
fiereeness of manner, will often help a man as much as a great balanee at
the banker's.
The two wedding parties met constantly in each other's apartments.
After two or three nights the gentlemen of an evening had a little picquet,
as their wives sate and chatted apurt. This pastime, and the arrival of
Jos Sedley, who made his appearance in his grand open carriage, and who
played a few games at billiards with Captain Crawley, replenished HRaw-
don's purse somewhat, and gave him the benefit of that ready money for
which the greatest spirits are aometimes at a stand-still.
So the thlree gentlemen wulked down to see the Lightning conch come
in. Punctual to the minute, the coach crowded inside and out, the guard
blowing his accustomed tune on the horn-the Lightning came tearing
down the street, and pulled up at the cosch-office.
:Hullo I there's old Dobbin,'' George cried, quite delighted to see
his old friend perched on the roof; and whose promised visit to Brighton
had been delayed until now. : How are you, old felloP Glad you're
come down. Emmy 'll be delighted to see you,'' Osborne said, shaking
his comrade warmly by tle hand as soon as lis descent from the vehicle
was effected-and then he added, in a lower and agitated voice,  What's
the news. IIave you been in Russell quare What does the governor
say Tell me everything.''
Dobbin looked very pale and grae. I've seen your father,'' said he.
`How 's Amelia-Mrs. George? I'll tell you all the news presently: but
1 'e brought the grest news of all : and that is--''
 Out with it, old fellow,'' George said.
We're ordlered to Belgium. All the army goes-Guards and all.
Heavytop's got the gout, and is mad at not bceing able to move. O'Dowd
goes in command, and we emnbhark from Chatham next week,''
This news of war could not but come with a shock upon our loers, and
caused all these gentlemen to look very serious.

Now, before he fnceed the hend of the Osborne house with the news

By a little iuquiry regarding lis mother's engagements, hs was pretty
soon able to find out y whom of her ladyship's frienhs parties were given
nt that senson; where he would be likely to meet Osborne's sisters; and,
though he hund that ubhorrencce of routs and cvening parties, which many
sensible men, alas, entertain, he soon found one where the Mliss Osbores
were to be present. Mnking his appearance at the ball, where he dunced
a couple of sets with both of them, and was prodigiously polite, he
actually had the courage to ask Mliss Osborne for a few minutes' conversa-
tion at an erly hour the next day, when he had, he said, toa -communicate
to her news of the vcry greatest interest.
WVhat was it that made her start bnek, and gaze upon him for n moment,
nnd then on the ground at her feet, and mske as if sle would fuiut on his
nr, had he not by opportunely trcadimg on her toes, broght the young
lady back to self-coutrol  WYhy was she so vialently agitated nt Dob-
bin's request? his cnn never be known. But when he came the next
day, MIaria was not in the drawing-room with her sister, and MIiss Wirt
went off for the purpose of fetching the latter, and the Cuptain and Miss
Osborne were left together. They were botl so sileut that tle tick-tock
of the Saerifice of lpligenia clock on the mantel-piece became quite rudely
aulible.
Wlat a nice party it was last night,'' Miss Osborne at lengtl began,
cncouragingly; ``nl-and low you' re improed in your dancing, Cap-
tain Dobbin. Surely somebody has taght you,'' she added, with amiale
archness.
 You should see me danee a reel with Mrs. Mnjor O'Dowl of ours;
anld a jig-dil you ecver scee a jig? But I think anybody eould dance
with yon, Miss Oshorne, who dance so well.''
Is the MIajor's lndy young and beautiful?' Captain,'' the fair ques-
tioner continued. `` Ah, what a terrible thing it must be to be n soldier's
wife. I wonder thcy have any spirits to dance, and in these dreadful
ties of war too! O Cuptain Dobbin, I tremble sometimes when I think
of our dearcst George, and the dangers of the noor soldier. Are there
many married ofticers of the -th, Captain Dobbin ''
``Upon my ord, she's playing her hand rather too openly,'' Mias
WYirt thought; but this observation is merely pareuthetic, and was not
hcnrd throngh thc crevice of the door at which the governess uttered it.
One of our young muen is just married,'' Dobbin said, now comiug to

the point. 'It was a very old attachment, and the young couple are as
poor as church mice.''
O, how delightfull O, ow romantiel1'' Mias Osborne eried, as the
Captuin said `' old attachment'' and `" poor.'' Her sympathy cnceoursged
him.
The finest young fellow in the regiment,'' he eontinued.  Notn
braver or handsomer officer in the army ; and such a charming wife Ho
you would like her; how you woill like her when you know her, Miss
Osborne.'' Tle young lady thought the aetual moment hud arrived, and
that Dobbin's nervousness which now came on and was visible in many
twitchings of his face, in his manner of beating the ground with his grcat
feet, in thc rapil buttoning anl unbuttoning of his frock-cont, e.-Miss
Osorne, I ssy, thought that when he had given limself a little air, he
would unosom himself eutircly, and prepared eagerly to listen. And the
clock, in the altar on which Iphigenia was situated, beginning, aftcr a pre-
paratory ceonvulsion, to toll twelve, the mere tolling seemed ns if it
would last until one-so prolonged was the knell to the anxious spinster,
' But it's not about marriage that I came to speak-that is thnt mar-
riage-that is-no, I mean-my dear Miss Osborne, it's about our denr
friend Gcorge,'' Dobbin snil.
`About Georgei'' ahe said in a tone so discomfitel thnat Maria and
Miss WVirt laughed at the other side of the door, and even that abandoned
wretceh of a Dobbin felt inclined to aile himself; for ho was not altogeter
uneonscious of the state of afairs; George having often bantered him graee-
fully aud said `Hang it, Will, wly don't you take old Poly She'll hase
you if you ask her. I 'I1 bet you five to two she will,''
 Yes, about George, then,'' he contiuued. There has been a differ-
oence between him and Mr, Osbomne. And I regard him so much-for you
know we have been like brothers-thnat I hope and pray the quarrel may
be settled. We must go abrond, Miss Osborne. We mnay e ordered oli
nt a dsy's wsrning. Who knows what may happen in the campaign 
Don't be agitated, dear Miss Osborne; and those two at least should part
friends.''
There has been no quarrel, Captain Dobbin, except a little usual
scene with papa,'' the lady said. e We are expecting George back daily.
What papa wantel was only for his good. IIe hns but to come back, nnd
I'm sure all will bo well; and denr kholn, who went away from here in
sad sad anger, I know will forgive him. Woman forgives but too readily,
Captain.''
`Such an angel as yon I am sure wonld,'' MIF, Dobbin said, with atro-
cious astuteness. `` And no man can pardon himself for giving a womun
pain. What would you feel, if n man were fuaithless to you''
I shoull perish-I should throw myself ont of window-I should
take poison-I should pine and die. I know I shonld,'' Miss cried, who
hal nevertheless gone through one or two affairs of the heart without any
ideas of suicide.
`'`And there are others,'' Dobbin continued, ``as true and as kind-
hearted as yourself. I'm not speaking abont the West India heiress,
Miss Osborne, but about a poor girl whom George once loved, and who

was bred from her childhood to think of nobody but him. I've seen her
in her poverty uncomplaining, broken-hearted, without a fault. It is of
Miss Sedley I speak. Dear Miss Osborne, can your generous heart quar-
rel with your brother for being faithful to herP Could his own conscience
ever forgive him if he deserted herP Be her friend-she always lovel
you-and-and I am come here charged by George to tell you that e
holds his engagement to her as the most sacred duty he has; and to
entreat yo, at least, to be on his side,''
When any strong emotion took possession of Mr. Dobbin, and after the
first word or two ol hesitation, he cvuld speak with perfect fluency, and it
was evident that his eloquenee on this occasion made some impression
upon the lady whom he addressed.
Well,'' snid she, ``this is-most surprising--most painful-most
extraordinary-what will Papa say -thast George should fling away such
a superb establislment as was oflered to him,-but at nny rate he has
found a very brae champion in you, Catain Dobbin. It is of no use,
however,'' she continued, aftcr a pause, `` I feel for poor Miss Sedley, most
certainly-most sincerely you know. We neer thought thc match a
good one, though we were always very kind to her here-very. But
Papa will never consent, I am sure. And a well brought up young woman
you know,-with a well regulated mind must-George must give her up,
dear Captain Dobbin, inleel he must.''
`Ought a man to give up the woman he loved, just when misfortune
befel her'' Dobbin said, holding out his hand. Denr Miss Osbornel
is this the counsel I hear from you' My der young laly l you must
befriend her. lle can't give her up. He must not give her up. Would
 man, tlink you, give ye up if you were poor ''
This adroit question touched the heart of Miss Jane Osborne not a
little.  `' I don't know whether we poor girls ought to believe what you
men say, Captain,'' she said. `There is that in woman's tenderness
which induces her to believe too easily. I 'm afrid you ure cruel cruel
deccivers,''-and Dobbin certainly thought he felt a pressure of the hand
whicl Miss Osborne had extendecd to lim.
Ie dropped it in some alarm. `` Deeceiversl'' said he. 'No, dear
Mfiss Osborne, all men are not; your brother is not; George has loved
Amelia Sedley ever since they were children; no wealth would make him
marry any but her. Ought le to forsake herP Would you counsel him
to do so"
What could MIiss Jane say to such a question, and with her own peculiar
views She could not answer it, so she parried it by ssying, `` Well, if
ou are not a deceiver, nt least you are ery rontic;'' and Captain
William let this observation pass without clallenge.
At length when, by the help of farther polite speecles, he deemed
that Mise Osborne was sufficiently prepared to receive the whole ews, he
poured it into her ear. ` George could not give up Amelia-George was
married to her''-and thcn he related the circumstances of the marriage
as we know them nlready, how the poor girl wonld have died hnd not her
lover kept his faith : how Old Sedley had refused all consent to the match,
and a licence had been got: and Jos Sedley had come from Cheltenham
A NOYEL WITH0UI A HERO.

to give awny the bride: how they had gone to Brighton in Jos's chariot-
and-four to pass the honey-muon: and how George counted on his dear
kind sisters to befriend him with their father, as women-so true and tender
as they were-assuredly would do. And so, asking permission (readily
granted) to see her again, and rightly conjecturing that the news he had
brouglt would be told in the uext five minutes to the otler ladies, Captain
Dobbin made lis bow and took his leave.
He was scarcely out of the house, when Miss Maria and Miss Wirt
rushed in to Miss Osborne, nnd the whole wonderful secret was imparted
to them by that lady. To do them justice, neither of the sisters were
very much displeased. There is something ubout a runaway match with
which few lndies can be seriously angry, and hAmelia rather rose in their
estimnation, from the spirit which she lad isplayed in consecnting to tle
union. As they debated the story, and prattled about it, and wondered
what Papus would do and say, cume a loud knock, as of an avenging
thunder-clap, at the door, which made these conspirators start. It must
be Papa, they thought. But it was not he. It was only Mr. Frederick
Bullock, who had cone from the city according to appointment, to conduct
the ladies to a flower-show.
This gentleman, as may be imagined, was not kept long in ignoranee of
the secret. But his face, when he heard it, showed an amazement which
was ery different to that look of sentimental wonder which the counte-
nances of thce sisters wore. Mr, Bullock was a man of the world, and a
junior partner of a weulthy firm. He knew wht money was, and the
value of it: and a delightful throb of expectation lightel up his little eyes,
nnd caused him to smile on his Maria, as he thought that by this piece of
folly of Mr. George's she might be worth thirty thousand pounds more
than he had ever hoped to get with her.
Gad . Jane,'' said he, surveying even the elder sister with some interest,
eEels sill be sorry he cried off. You my be a fify thousaud pounder yet.''
The sisters had never thought of the money question up to that
moment, but Fred Bullock bantered them with graceful gaiety about it
during their forenoon's excursion; and they had risen not a little in their
own estcem by the time when, thce morning amusement over, they drove
back to dinner. And do not let my respected reader exclaim aguainst this
selfishness as unnaturnl. It was but this present morning, as he rodle on
the omnibus from Richmond; while it changed horses, this present
chronicler, being on the roof, marked three little children playing in a
puddle below, very dirty anl friendly and happy. To these three prc-
sently came another little oe. Polly,'' says she, ``yowr sister's gol a
penwy.'' At which the children got up from the puddle instantly, and
ran of to pay their court to Peggy. And as the omnibus drove olf I
saw Peggy with the infantine procession at her tail, marehing with great
dignity towards the stall of a neighbouring lollipop-woman.

O having prepared the sisters, Dobbin hast-
ened away to the City to perform the rest
nnd more difficult part of the task which
he had undertaken. The idea of facing old
Osborne renderel him not a little nervous,
and more than once he thought of lenving the
young lndies to communicate the seeret,
which, as he was aware, they could not long
retain. IBut he hnd promised to report to
George upon the manner in which the elder
Osborne bore the intelligencee; so going into
 the City to the paternal counting-house in
i .aG
L  to Mr. Osborne begging for n half-hour's
conversation relative to the affairs of his son
George. Dohbin's mcssenger returned from Mr. Osborne's house of
busincse, with the compliments of the latter, who would be vsery happy
to see the Captain immediately, and away acerdingly Dobbin went to
confront him.
The Captain, with a half-guilty secret to confess, and with the proseet
of a painful and stormy interview hefore him, entered Mr. Osborne's offices
with n most dismal countenancee aud abashed gait, and, pnssing through
the outer room where Mr. Chopper presided, was greeted by that fmc-
tionary fromn his desk with a waggish air which farther discomfited him.
Mr, Chopper winked and nodded and pointed his pen towards his patron's
door, and said,  Yon'll find the governor all riglt,'' with the most pro-
voking good humour.
Osborne rose too, and shook him henrtily by the hand, and suaid,  Iow
do, my dear boy ?'' ith a cordiality that mnde poor George's ambassador
feel doubly guilty. His hand lay as if dead in the old gentleman's grasp.
IIe felt thnt he, Dobbin, was more or less the cause of all that had
happened. It was he had brought back Gcorge to Amelia; it was he hnad
applauded, eneouraged, transacted almost the marriage which he wrs
come to revenl to George's father : and the latter was receiving him witl
smiles of welcome; patting him on the shouldcr, and calling lim
`Dobbin, my der boy.'' The envoy had indeed good reason to hang
his head.
Osborne fully bclieved that Dobbin had come to announce his son's
surrender. Mr. Chopper and his principal were talking over the matter
between George and his fuather, at the very moment when Dobbin's

messenger arrived. Both agreed that George was sending in his submis-
sion. Both had been expecting it for some days-and `` Lord1 Chopper,
whnt a narriage we'll have,'' Mr. Osborne said to his clerk, snapping his
big fingers, and jingling all the guineas and shillings in his great pockets
as he eyed his subordinate with a look of triumph.
With similar operations conducted in both pockets, and a knowing jolly
air, Osborne from his chair regarded Dobbin seated blank and silent
opposite to him.  WFhat a bumpkin he is for a Captain in the army,'' old
Osborne thought. I wonder George hasn't taught him better manners.''
At Iast Dobbin summoned courage to begin. : Sir,'' snid ho, ``I've
brought you some very grave news. I have been at the IIorse Gunrds
this morning, anl there 's no douht thnt our regiment will be ordered
abroud, and on its way to Belgium before the week is over. And you
know, Sir, thnt we sh'nt be hoe again bfore a tussle which mny be fuatal
to many of us.''
Osborne looked grne. ``My s--, the regient will lo its duty, Sir,
I dnresay,'' he snil.
The French are very strong, Sir,'' Dobbsin went on.  The Russians
and Austrians will be a long time before they can bring thcir troops down.
We shall have the first of the fight, ir; and depend on it Boney will
take cre that it shall be a hard one.''
 Wht are you driving at, Dobbin,'' his iuterloeutor snid, nensy
and with a scowl. 'I suppose no Briton's afranid of any d- French-
man, hay ''
I ouly mcan, that before we go, and considering the great nnd certain
risk thnt hnngs over cvery one of us-if there are any differences betwee
you and George-it would be as well, Sir, that-that you should shake
hands: wouldn't itP Should anything happen to him, I think yon would
never forgive yoursclf if you hndn't parted in charity.''
As he said this, poor William Dobbin blushed crimson, and felt and
owned that he himself wns a traitor. But for him, perhaps, this severance
neel never have taken place. Why hnd not George's msrriage bcen
delayed  Whuat call wns there to press it on so eagerly? He felt thnt
Gcorge would have parted from Amelia nt any rate without n mortal pang.
hmelia, too, miht have recovered the shock of losing him. It was his
counsel hal brought about this marriage, nnd all that was to cnsue from
it. And why was itP Becnuse he loved her so much that he eould not
bear to see her uuhappy: or because his own sufferings of suspense were
so unendurable that he was glad to erush them at once-ns we hasten a
funeral after n deuth, or, when a scparation from those we love is immi-
nent, cannot rcst until the parting be over.
ou arc a good fellow, Willinm,'' snil MIr. Osborne in a softened voice;
`and me and George shouldn't part in anger, tht is true. Look here.
I 've done for hi as much ns any fnther evcr did. 1e's had three times
as ttch oney tfrom me, as 1 warrant your father ever gave you. But lI

and he refuses me. Am I wrong Is the quarrel of y making What
lo I seck but his good, for which I've been toiling like a eonvict ever since
le was boru? Nobody can say there 's anything selfish in me. Let him
come back. I say, here's my hand. I sy, forget and forgive. As for
mnrrying now, it 's out of the question. Let him and Miss S. make it up,
and make out the marriage afterwards, when he comes back a Colonel; for
he slall e a Colonel, by G- he shall, if onsy can do it. I'm gld
you've brought him round. I know it's you Dobbiu. You 've took him
out of many a scrape before. Let him come. lI shan't be harl. Coe
along, and dine in lussell Sqare to-day: both of you. The old shop,
thle old hour. ou 'll find a neck of venison, and no questions asked.''
This praise and conhidence smote Dobbin's henrt very keenly. Every
momcnt the colloquy continued in this tone, he flt more and more gilty.
Sir,'' sailhe, ' I fear you deceive yourself. I am sure you do. Georga
is mucl too high-mindel a man cver to marry for money. A threat on
your part that you would disinherit him in cuse of disobedience would
only e followed by rcsistance on his.''
WYhy, hang it, man, you don't cnll offering him eight or ten thousand
 year, threatening lim :'' Mr. Osborne said, with still prooking good
huour. 'Gad, if Miss S. will hase me, I'm hcr man. I aint pnr-
ticular about a shade or so of tawny.'' Ad tle old gentleman gave his
knowing grin, and coarse laugh.
 You forget, Sir, previous egagements into which Captain Osbornc
ad entered,'' the ambnssador said, gravely.
What engagements Whnt the devil do you mean? You don't
mean,'' Mr. Osborne continued, gatlering wrath and astonishucnt as the
thought now first camc upon him-you don't mean that he's such a
d- fool ns to be still hankeringg after that swindling oll baukrupt's
daughter? You 've not come here for to make me suppose that he wants
to marry ler  Marry ler, that is a good one. My son and heir marry
a beggar's girl out of a gutter. D- him, if he does, lct lim buy a
broom and sweep a crossing. She was nlways dangling antd ogling after
him, I recollcct now; and I've no doubt she was put on by her old
sharer of a father.''
Mr. Sedley was your ycry gool friend, Sir,'' Dobbin interposed, almost
pleased at finding hinself growing angry.  Time was you cnllcd him
bctter names than rogue and swindler. The match was of your making
George had not right to play fast and loose-.''
 Fast and loosel'' howled out old Osborne. Fast and loose. WVhy,

gave himself airs, Iast Thrsdy was a fortnight, and talked alout thc
British army to his father wio made him, What, it's you who have

you who want to introduce beggurs into my family. Thank you for
nothling, Captain. Marry Ier indeed-he, hel why should he? Iwurrant
you shc'd go to him fast cnough without.''
Sir,'' said Dobbin, starting up in undisguised anger; ``no an slall

Mr. Osborne,'' said Dobbin, with a faltering voice, `` it's you who are
insultiug the best crenture in the world. ou had best spare her, Sir, for
hc's your son's wife.''
Anl with this, feeling that le could suay no more, Dobbin went asay,
Osborne siuking back in his chair, and looking wildly aftcr him. A clerk
came in, obedient to the bcll; and tle Captain was scarcely out of the
court where Mr. Osborne's ofhfices were, when Mr. Clhopper the chief clerk
came rushing hatless after him.
 or God's sake, what is it P'' MIr., Chopper said, catching the Captain
by the skirt. ``1he governor's in a fit. What has Mr. eorge been
ding?''
He married Miss Sedley five days ago,'' Dobbin replied. `I was his
groomsman, MIr. Chopper, and you must stand his fricnd.''
The old clerk shook his head.  If that's your news, Cuptain, it 's Mal.
The governor will never forgive lim.''
Dobbin begged Chopper to reort progrcss to him at the hotel whcre
he was stopping, and walked of moodily westwards, greatly perturbed ns
to the past nd the fnture.
WYhen the Russell Square family came to dinner that evcning, they found
the father of the house seated in his usual place, but with that nir of gloom
on his face, which, whenever it appearel therc, kept the whole eircle silent.
The lalies and Mr. Bullock who dinel with themn, fclt that the news had
been communicated to Mr. Osborne. His dark looks afleetel MIr. Bullock
so far as to render him still nnd quiet: but he was unusually bland and
atteutive to Miss Marias, by whom ho sut, and to her sister presiding at tle
hend of the table.
Miss Wirt, by consequencee, was alone on her sile of the boarl, a g
being left etween her and Miss Jane Osborne. Now this was Gcorge's
place when he dined at home ; and his cover, as we said, was lnid for him
in expectation of tht truant's reurn. Nothing occurred during dinner-
time except smiling Mr. Frederic's flagging confilential whispers, anl the
cliuking of plate and china, to interrupt the silencse of the repust. The
servants went about stealthily doing thcir duty. Mutes at funerals could
ot look moro glum than the domestics of Mr. Osborne. ho neck of
venison of which he hnd invited Dohbin to partake, was crvcd by him in
perfeet silence ; but his own share went awy almost untastcd, though he
lrank much, and the butler nssiduously filled lis glass.
At last, just at the enl of the dinner, his cyes, which hal been staring
at everyoly in turn, fixed themsclves for a while upon the plate laid for
George. He poiuted to it presently with his left hand. Ilis duglters
looked at him and did not conprehend, or choose to comprchcnd, the
signal; nor did the serants at first understand it.
 Tke that plate away,'' at lst he snaid, getting up withl an oath-and
with this pushing lis chair back, he walkel into his own room.
Behind Mr, Osborne's dining-room was the usual apartment which went
in his house by the name of the study; and was scred to the master of
the house. Hither Mr. Osborne would retire of a Sunday forenoon when

not mindel to go to church; and here pass the morning in his crimson
lenther chair, reading the paper. A couple of glased book-cases were here,
containing standard works in stout gilt bindings. The '`Annul legister,''
the `` Gentleman's Magazine,''  Blair's Sermons,'' and '` Hume anl Smol-
let.'' From year's end to year's end he never took one of these olumes
from the shelf; but there was no member of the family thnt woull dnre
for his life to touch one of the books, except upon those rare Sunday
eveuings when there was no dinner party, and when the great scarlct lBible
and Prayer-book were taken out from the corner where they stood beside
his copy of the lcerage, anl the servants being rung up to the dining par-
lour, Osborne read the evening service to is family in a loud grating
pompous voice. No member of the houselhold, child or domestic, ever
entered tlat room witlout a certain terror. IIecre e checked the louse-
keeer's aecounts, nnd overhauled the butler's cellar-book. IIence he could
command, across the clean gravel court-yard, the back cntrance of the
stables with which one of his bells communicated, and into this yard the
concluman issued from his premises as into a dock, and Osborne swore t
him from the stuly wimlow. Four times a yenr Misg Wirt ontered this
apartment to get her salary; und his daughters to receive their qurterly
allowance. George as a boy had been horsewhipped in this room many
times; his rother sittiug sick on the stair listening to the cuts of the
whip. The boy was scnrcely ever known to cry under the punishment;
the poor woman uscd to fondle and kiss lim seeretly, and give him money
to soothe him when he came out.
There was a picture of the family over the mantel-piece, remoel thither
from the front room after Mr. Oaborne's denth-eorge was on a poney,
the clder sister holding him up a bunceh of flowers; the younger led by
her mother's hanl,; all with red cleeks and large red mouths, simpering
on eacl other in the approved family-portrait manner. The mother lay
under ground no, long since forgotten-the sisters and brother had a
hundred lifferent interests of their own, and, familiar still, were utterly
estranged from cach other. Some few score of yenrs afterwarls, when all the
parties rcpresented are grow old, whnt bitter sntire there is in thoseflaunt-
ing cluildish fily-portraits, with their farce of seutiment and smiling lies,
nnd innocence so self-conscious and self-satisfied. Osborne's own state
portrait, with thnt of his great silver inkstnnd and arm-ehair, had taken the
plnce of honour in the dining-room, vacated by the family-piece.
To this study oldl Osborne retired tlen, greatly to the relief of the small
party whom he left. When the serants hnd withdrawn, they began to
talk for a while volubly but very low; then they wcent up stnirs quietly,
Mr. Bllock aceompanying them stealthily ou his crenking shoes. He
had no lenrt to sit nlone drinking wine, and so close to the terrible old
gcntlemn in the stuly hard at hnnd.
n honr at lcenst after dnrk, the butler, not having received any sum-
mons, ventured to tap at his door and tske him in wax eandles and tea.
The aster of the house sate in his chair, pretending to real the paner,
and when the servant, placing the lights anl refrcshment on the table by
him, retired, Mr. Osborne got up and lockel the door after him. Tlis
time there was no mistaking the matter; all the household knew that sone

great catastrophe was going to happen which was likely direly to
affeet Master George.
In the large shining mahogany escrutoire Mr. Osborne had a drawer
especially devoted to his ason's atfairs nnd pnpers. lIere he kept all the
locnments relating to him ever siuee he had been a boy: here were his
prize eopy-books and drawing-books, all bearing George's hnnd, nnd that
of the muaster : here were his first letters in large round hnnd senling lis
love to papa and muma, and conveying his petitions for a cuka. IIis dear
godpapa Sedley was more than once mentioned in thcm. Curses quivered
on old Osborne's livid lips, und horrid hatrel and disappointmcnt writhed
in his heart, ns looking through some of these papers he cume on tht name.
They were all marked and docketed, and tied with red tape. It was-

pompous book, seldom looked at, and shining all over with gold. There
was a frontispiece to the volume, representing Abraham sncrificing Isaac.
Here, according to custom, Osborne had recorded on the fly-leaf, anl
in his large clerk-like hand, the dates of his marringe and his wife's
death, and the births and Christian names of his children. Jane came
first, theu George edley Osborne, then Mnria Frances, and the lays of
the christening of each. Tnking a pen, he carefully obliteratel George's
names from the page; and when the leaf was quite dry, restored the
volume to the place from which he hnd moved it. hen hc took a

vant, whom he chrged to eliver it in the morning. It was morning
alrendy: as hc went up to bed, the whole house was alight with the
snnshine: anl the birdls were singing among the fresh green leaes in
Russell Square.
Anxious to keep all Mr. Osborne's family and dependants in good humour,
and to make as many friends as possible for George in his hour of adversity,
WVilliam Dobbin, who knew the effeet which good dinners and good wines
have upon the soul of man, wrote off immediately on his return to his inn,
the most lospitable of invitations to Thomas Chopper, Esquire, begging
that gentleman to dine with him at thc Slaughter's next dny. The note

rough draft of the answer were shown to Mrs. Chopper and her daughters
on his return to Somcrs' Town that evening, and they talkel about mili-
tary gents and West End men with great exultation as the family sate
and puartook of tea. WYhen tlc girls had gone to rest, Mr. and Mrs. C.
discoursed upon the strange erents which were occurring in the governor's
famnily. Never had the clerk seen bis principal so moved. When he
went in to Mr. Osborne, after Cnptain Dobbin's departure, Mr. Chopper
found his chief blaek in the face, and all but in a fit: some dreadful quar-
rel, he was certain, had occurred between Mfr. O. and the young Captain.
Chopper had been instructed to make out nn account of all sums paid
to Cuptnin Oaborne within the last three years. ``And a precious lot of
money he has hnl too,'' thoe chief clerk snid, aud respected his old and
yoiig master the more, for the liberal way in which the guinens had
been tlung about. The dispute was eomething about Miss Sedley. Mre.
Chopper vowed and declared, she piticl that poor young lady to lose such
n handsome young fllow as the Capting. As the dughter of nn unlucky
speculator, who had paid n very shabby dividend, Mr. Chopper had no
great regard for Miss Seley. He respected the house of Osborne before
all otliers in the city of London: and his hope and wish was, that Cuptain
George should marry n nobleman's duaughter. The clerk slept a great

Mr, Osborne's conntenance, when le arrived in tle City nt his usual
time, struck those dependants who were aecustomed, for good resons, to
watch its expression, as peculiarly ghastly and wo. At twelve o'clock
Mr. Higgs (of the frm of Higgs & Blatherwick, solicitors, Bedford Row,)
called by appointment, and was ushered into the governor's privste room,
and closeted there for more than an hour. At ubout one Mr. Chopper
received a note brought by Captain Dobbin's man, and containing an
inclosure for Mr. Osborne, which the clerk went in and deliered. A
short time afterwards MIr. Chopper and Mr. Birch, the next clerk, were
summoned, and requested to witness a paper.  I've been making a new
till,'' Mr. Osborne said, to which these gentlemen appended their names
accordingly. No convrersation passed. Mr. Higgs looked exreeedingly
grave as he came into the outer rooms, and very hard in Mr. Chopper's
tace; but there were not any explanations. It was remarked that Mr.
Osborne was particularly quiet nd gentle all day, to the surprise of
those who had augured ill from his darkling demeanour. Ile called no
man names that day, and wns not heard to swear once. He left business
early ; and before going away, summoned his chief clerk once more, and
hasing gien him general instructions, asked him, after some seeming
hesitation and reluctance to speak, if he knew whether Cnptain Dobbin
was in town f
Chopper said he belieed he was. Indeed both of them knew the fact
perfcctly.

Osorne took a letter directed to that offieer, and, giving it to the clerk,
requcsted the latter to deliver it into Dobbin's own hands immediately.
`And now Chopper,'' says he, taking his hnt, and with a strange look,
`my mind will be easy.'' Exactly as the cloek struck two, (there was uo
doubt an appointment between the pair,) Mr. Frederick Bullock called,
and he and Mr. Osborne walked away together,
The Colonel of the -th regiment, in which Messieurs Dobbin and Os-
borne had companies, was an old general who had made his first campaign
unler Wolf at Quebec, and wns long sincee quite too old anl fecble for
command; but he took some interest in the regiment of which he was thec
nominal head, and madc certain of lis young oflicers welcoe at his tuable,
a kind of hospitality which I believe is not altogetler comumon amongst
his brethren of the present day. Captai Dobbin was an especial faourite
of this old General. Dobbin was vereed in the literature ot his profession,
and could talk ulout the great Frederic and the Emress Queen and their
wrnrs ahost as well ase the General himself, who was indifferent to the
triumphs of the present day, and whose heart was with the tacticians of fifty
years back. This officer sent a summons to Dobbin to come and breakfast
with him, on the morning when Mr. Oaborne altered his will and MIr.
Chopper put on lis best shirt frill, nnd then informed his young faourite, a
couple of days in advance, of that which they were all expecting-a march-
ing order to go to Belgium. The order for the regient to hold itself in
readiness would leuve the 1Iorse Gurds in u day or two; and as trans-
ports were in plenty, they would get thcir route before the weck was over.
kecruits hal come in during the stay of the regiment at Chatham; and the
old General hoped that the regiment which hnd helped to beat Montcalm
in Canada, and to rout Mr. WYashington on Long Island, would prove
itself worthy of its historical reputation on the oft-trolden battle-grounds
of the lLow Countries. ``And so my gool friend, if you have any afire
I,'' said the old General, taking a pinch of snuff with his trembling white
old hand, and then poiuting to the spot of his robe de ckamre under
which his heart was still feebly beating, ``if you hae nny Phillis to con-
sole, or to bid farewell to papa and mama, or any will to nke, I recom-
mend you to set about yomr business without delay.'' With which the
General gnve his young fricnd s finger to shake, and a good-natured nod
of his powdered and pig-tailed head; and the door being closed upon Dob-
bin, asate don to pe e e e was exeeedingly ain of his Frencl) ta
Malemoiselle Amenaide of His MInjesty's Theatre.
This news made Dobbin grave, and he thought of our friends at Brighton,
nnd then he wns ashamed of lumself that Amelia was always the first thing.
in his thoughts, (always before anybody-before father nnd mother, sisters
and duty-alays at waking nd sleeping indeed, and all day long); and
returning to his hotel, he sent off a brief note to Mr, Osborne acquainting
him with the information which he had received, and which might tend
farther, he hopecd, to bring about a reconciliation with George.
This note, dispatched by the same messenger who sd canrried the in-
vitation to Chopper on the previous day, alarmed the worthsy clerk not a
little. It was inelosed to him, and ns he opened the letter he trembled
lest tie dinner should be put off on which he was calculating. llis mind

was inexpressily relieved when he found that the enelope was only a
reminder for himself. (I shall expect you at hnlf-past five,'' Captuin Dob-
bin wrote). He was very much intecrested about his employer's family;
but, oe coulec ous ' a grand dinner was of more concern to him than
the affairs of any other mortal.
Dobbin ws quite jnustified in repeating the Genernl's informstion to auy
officers of the regiment whom he should see in the course of his peregrina-
nations; accordingly he imparted it to Ensign Stuhble, whom he met at
the agent's, and who, such wns his military nrdour, went off instantly to
purchase a new sword ar the nccoutrement-maker's. Hore this young
ellow, who though only seventeen years of age, and about sixty-five inches
high, with n constitution naturally rickety nud much impired by prcna-
ture brandy and water, had an undoubted courage und a lion's heart, poised,
tried, bent, and balanced a weapon such ns he thought would do execu-
tion amongst Frenchmen. Shouting `` IIa, ha,'' nnd stamping lis little feet
with tremenleus enrgy, he deliered the point tiee or thrice nt Cnptain
Dobbsin, who parried the thrust laughingly with his bamboo wnlking-stick.
Mr, Stubble, as may be supposed fromn his size and slenderness, was of
the Light Bobs. FEnsign pooney, on the contrary, was a tall youth, and
belonged to (Captain Dobbin's) the Grenadier Company, and he triel on
n new benr-skin cap, under which he looked saage beyond his ycnrs.
Then these two lads went off to the Slaughter's, and haing orderel a
furmous dinner, sate down and wrote off letters to the kind anxious parents
at home-letters full of love and hertiness, and pluck anl bad spelling.
Ahl there were many anxious hearts beating through England at that
time; and mothers' prayers and tears flowing in many homesteads.

tables at the Slaughter's, and the tcears trickling down his nose on to the
puaper, (for the youngster was thinking of his mama, and that he might
never see her again,) Dobbin, who was going to write off a letter to
George Osborne, relented, and locked up his desk.  Why should I?2'
said he. `'Lct her have this night, happy. Ill go and see my parents
erly in the morning, aud go down to Briglton myself to-morrow.''
So he went up and laid his big hand on young Stubble's shoulder, and
backed up that young champion, and told him if he would leave off brandy
nd wnter he would be a good soldier, as he always as a gentlemanly
good-hearted fellow. Young Stubble's eyes brightened up at this, for
Dobbin was greatly respeeted in the regient, as the best officer and thc
cleverest man in it.
 Thank you, Dobbin,'' he said, rubbing his eyes with his knuckles, I
was just-just telling her I would. And, O Sir, she's so dam kind to
me.'' The water pumps were at work agin, and I am not sure that the
soft-hearted Cuptain's eyes did not also twiukle.
The two ensigns, the captain and Mr. Chopper, dined togetler in the
same box. Chopper brouglt the letter from Mr. Osborne in whiech the
latter bricfly preseuted lis conpliments to Cuptain Dobbin, nnd requested
him to forwvard the inclosei to Captain George Osborne. Chopper knew
nothing further ; he described Mr. Osborne's appearance, it is true, and his
interview with his lawyer, wondered how the governor hnd sworn at
nobody, and, cspecially as the wine cireled round, abounded in speculations
and conjectures. But these grew more vague with every glass, and at lcngth
became perfectly unintelligiblc. At a late hour Captain Dobbin put his
guest iuto u hackney coach, in a hiccupping state, nd sweuring that he
would be the kiock--the kick-captain's friend for ever and ever.
WYhen Captain Dobbin took leave of Miss Osborne we have snid tlnt he
nsked leave to come and pay her another visit, and the spinster expected
him for some hours the next day, when, perlaps, had he come, and had he
asked her that question which she was prepared to answer, she would have
leclared herself as her brother's friend, and a reconciliation might have
been effeeted between George and his angry father. But though she
waited at home the cnptain neer cnme. lle had his ow affairs to pur-
sue; his own parents to visit and console; and at an early hour of the day
to takc his place on the Lightning coach, and go down to his friends at

orders that thmat medlling scoundrel, Captain bDobbin, should never be
admitted within his doors again, and nny hopes in which she mny have
inudulged privately, were thus abruptly brought to an end. Mr. Frederic

G-
oNDUCTED to the lsdies, at the
Ship Inn, Dobbin assumed a jovial
nnd rattling manner, which proved
that this young officer was be-
coming a more consummate hypo-
crite every day of his lifte. IIe
was trying to hide his own private
feelings, first upon seeing Mrs.
George Osborne in her new con-
dition, and secondly to mask the
apprehensions he entertained as to
the effect which the dismal news
brought down by him would cer-
tainly have upon her.
 It is my opiuion, George,''
he sid, thnt the Frenech Em-
peror will be upon us, horse and foot, before three weeks ure over, and
will give the Duke such a dance as shall muke the Peninsula apper mere
child's play. But you need not ssy that to Mrs. Osborne, you know.
There mayn't be any fighting on our side after all, and our business in
Belgium may turn out to be n mere military oceupation. Many pcrsons
think so; and Brussels is full of fine people and ladies of fashion.'' So
it was agreed to represent the duty of the British army in Belgium iu this
harmless light to Amelia.
Tlis plot being arrunged, the hypoeriticnl Dobbin saluted Mrs. George
Oaborne quite gaily, tried to pay her one or two compliments relative to
her new position as a bride (which compliments, it must be confessed,
were cxceedingly clumsy and hung fire wofully), and then fell to talking
about Brighton, and the sea-air, and the gieties of the plaee, and the
beauties of the rond and the merits of the `' Lightning'' coach nnd horses,
--all in n manner quite incomprehensible to Amelia, and very amusing ta
Rebecca, who was watching the Captain, as indeed she watched every one
near whom she came.
Little Amelia, it must be owned, had rather a men opinion of her
husband's friend, Captain Dobbin. He lisped-he was very plain and
honely-looking : and exceedingly nwkward and ungainly. She liked him
Ior his attacehment to her husband, (to be sure there wns very littlc merit
in that), and she thought George wns most generous and kind in extend-
ing his friendship to his brother oficer. George had mimiked Dobbin's
isp and queer manners many times to her, though to do him justice, he

always spoke most highly of his friend's good qualities. In her little dny
of triuph, and not knowing him intimately as yet, she mnde light of
honest William-and he knew her opinions of him quite well, and
acquiesced in them very humbly. A time came when she knew him
better, and changed her uotions regarding him: but that was distant
as yet.
As for Rebecca, Captain Dobbin had not been two hours in the ladies'
company, before she understood his secret perfectly. She did not like
him, and feared him privately; nor was he very much prcpossessed in her
favour. He was so honest, that her arts and cjolerics id not affect him,
and he shrank from her with inslinctive repulsion. And, as she was by no
means so far superior to her sex as to be above jelousy, she disliked him
the more for his adoration of Amelia. Nevertheless, she was very
respectful and cordial in her manner towards him. A friend to the
Osbornesl a friend to ler dearest benelactorsl Sh vowed she should
always love him sincerely : she remembered him quite well on the Vaux-
hall night, as she told Amelis archly, and she made a little fun of lim
when the two lndies went to dress for diner. Rawdon Crawley paid
scarcely any attention to Dobbin, looking upon lim as a good-natured
nincompoop, aud under-bred city man. Jos patronised him with much
dignity.
When George and Dobin were alone in the latter's room, to which
George had followed him, Dobbin took from his lesk the letter which
he had been charge by Mr. Osborne to deliver to his son.  It 's not in
my father's hand-writing,'' said George, looking rsther alarmed; nor
was it: the letter was from Mr. Osborne's lawyer, and to the following
ellect :-
 BzDron Row, Ifay 7, 1815.
Sn,
 I am commissioned by Mr. Osborne to inform you, that he ubides by
the determination which e before expressed to you, and that in conse-
quence of the marriage which you have been pleased to contract, he
eeases to consider you henceforth as a member of his famiiy. This deter-
mination is final and irrevocable.
`lthough the monies cxpended upon you in your minority, and the
bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years, far
exceced in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right,
(being the third part of thce fortune of your mother, the late Mrs. Osborne,
nnd which reverted to you at her decease, and to Miss Jane Osborne and
Miss Muaria Frances Osborne;) yet I am instructed by Mr. Osborne to
asay, that he waives all cluim upon your estate, and that the sum of 2000,
4 per cent. annuities, at the alue of te day (being your one-tlird share
of the sum of E6000,) shall be paid over to youreelf or your agents upon
your receipt for the same, y
 Your obedient Servt.,

P.9S.-Mr. Osorne desires me to sny, once for all, that he dcclines to
reeccive any messages, lctters, or communicutions from you on this or any
other subject.''

'A pretty ay you have managed the affair,'' snid George, looking
savagely at William Dobbin. ``Look there, Dobbin,'' anl he flung over
to the lnatter lis parent's letter. ``A beggar, y Jove, and all in conse-
quenee of my d-d sentimentality. Why oouldn't we have waited? A
ball might have done for me in the course of the war, nd may still, nnd
how will Emmy be bettercd by being left n beggar's widow It wns all

n sum won't last two years. I 've lost a hundrcd nnl forty to Crawley at
cnrds and billiards since I've been down here. A pretty manager of a
man's matters yoeu are, forsooth.''
Therc's no denying thut the position is a hard one,'' Dobbin replied,
after reading over tho lettr with a blank countenance; `` and, as you sny,
it is partly of my making. There are somce men that woulln't mind changing
with you,'' he adled, with a bitter smilc.  How many Captains in the
recgiment have two thousand pounds to the fore, think you? You must
live on your pay till your futher relents, and if you die, you lcave your
wife a hundred a year.''
Do you suppose a man of my habits can live on his pay and a hun-
dred a yearP'' George criel out in great anger.  You must be n fool to
talk so, Dobbin. How the deuce am l to keep up my position in the
world upon such a pitiful pittancef I can't change my habits. I must
lae my comforts. I wasn't brought up on porridge like MacWhirler, or
on potatoes, like old O'Dowl. Do you expeet my wife to take in soldiers'
washing, or ride after the regiment in a baggage waggon''
Well, wel,'' said Dobbin, still good-naturedly, ' we 'll get her a better
conveyance. But try and remember that you nre only a dethroncd prince
now, George, my boy; and be quiet whilst the tempest lasts. It won't be
for long. Let your name be mentioned in the Gazette, and I'll engage
the old father relents towards you.''
Mentioned in the Gazatte.'' George answered. ' And in what part
of it Among the killel and wounded returns, and at the top of the list,
very lkely.''
Psha It will be time enough to cry out when we are hurt,'' Dabbin
said. `' Anl if anything happens, you know, George, I have got a littlc,
nnd I am not a marrying man, and I shall not forgct my godson in my
ill,'' he ndded, with a smile. Wereupon the lispute ended,-as many
scores of such conversations hctween Osborne and his friend had concluded
preiously-by the former deelariug there was no possibility of being angry
with Dobbin long, and forgiving him very generously after absing hi
without cause,

`I suppose she 'll ery her eyes out,'' Becky answered. ` She has been

replied. :Besides, you 're different. You go as General Tufto's aide-

down and kissed it.

A NOEL WIEOD A HER0.

havring prsetised it in former days upon Rawdon Crawley. He thought
her gay, brisk, arch, distinguee, delightful. In their little drives and
dinners Becky, of course, quite outshone poor Emmy, who remained
very mute and timid while Mrs. Crwley and her husband rattled away
together, and Captain Crawley (and Jos after he joined the young marriel
people) gobbled in silenee.
Emmy's mind soehow misgave her about her friend. Rebeecn's wit,
spirits, and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet. They
were only a week married, and here was George already suffering enni
nnd eager for others' societyl She trembled for the future. How shull
I be n companion for him, she thought,-so clever and so brilliant, and 1
sueh a humble foolish creature How noble it wns of him to marry me-
to gie up cverything and stoop down to me. I ought to have refused
him, only I had not the heart. I ought to have stopped at home nd
taken care of poor popa. And hcr neglect of er parents (nd indeed
there was some foundation for this charge which the poor child's ineasy
conscience brought against her) was now remnembered for the first timc,
and cnused her to blush with humiliation. Ohl thought zhe, I have bcen
very wicked and selfish-elfish in forgetting them ia their sorrows-
selfish in forcing George to marry me. I know I 'm not worthy of him-
I know he would have been happy without me-and yet-I tried, I tried
to gie him up.
It is hard when, hefore sewvrlays of marriage are oer, such thoughts
and confessions as these force tnselves on a little bride's miud. But so
it was, and the night before Dobin cume to join thesb young peopkc-on
a fine brilliant moonlight nigft of May-so warm anl balmy thnt the

umder her awning, and insist on a reconciliation in the water. Isn't that
n stratagemP''
George burst out lnughing at the idea of this aquatic meeting. : What's
the row there, you two'' Rawdon shouted out, rttling the box.
Amelia was making a fool of herself in an absurd hysterical manner, and
retired to her own room to whimper in private.
Our listory is lestined in this Chapter to go bnekwards and forwards in
a very irresolute munner seemingly, and having conducted our story to
to-morrow presently, we shall immediately again have oceasion to step back
to yesterday, so that the whole of the tale may get a hearing. As you be-
old nt her Majesty's drawing-room, the ambassadors' and high dignitaries'
carriages whisk off from a privnte door, while Captain Jones's lndies are
waiting for their fly: as you see in the Seretary of the Treasury's ante-
chamber, a hnlf-dozen of petitioners waiting patiently for their audience, and
cnalled out one by one, when suddenly an Irish member or some eminent per-
sonage enters the aprtment, and instantly walks into Mr. Under-Secretary
over the heads of all the people present: so in the conduet of a tale, the
romancer is obliged to exercise this most partial sort of justice. Although
nll the little incidents must be heard, yet they must be put off when the
great events make their appearance; and surely such a circumstance as
that whieh brought Dobbin to Brighton, viz. the orlering out of the
Guards and the line to elgium, and the mustering of the allied nrmies in
that country under the command of his Grace the Duke of Wellington-
such a dignified circumstanee as that I say-was entitled to the pas over nll
minor oeecurrences whereof this history is compcsed minly, and hence a
little trifling disarrangement and disorder wase excusable and beocoming.
We have only now advanced in time so far beyond Chapter XXII. as to
have got our various characters up into their dressing-rooms lefore the
dinner, which took place as usual on the day of Dohbin's arrival.
George was too humane or too much occupied with the tie of his neck-
loth to coney at once nll the news to MAmelia which his comrade had
brought with him from London. He came into her room, however, hold-
ing the attorney's letter in his land, and with so solemn and important an
nir that his wife, always ingeniously on the wntch for calamity, thought the
worst was about to befal, und running up to her husband, besought her
dearest George to tell her everything-he was ordered abrond; there
would he a battle next week-she knew there would.
Dearest George parried the question ubout foreign service, and withas
melancholy shake of the hesd said, : No, Emmy; it ian't that : it's not
myself I care nbout : it's you. I have hnd bad news from my father.
He refuses any communication with me; he has flung us off; and leaves
us to poverty. I can rough it well cnough; but you, my dear, how will
you benr it rend here. And he handed her over the letter.
melia, with a look of tender alarm in her eyes, listened to her noble
hero as he uttered the nbove generous sentiments, aud sitting down on the
bed, read the letter which George gave her with such a pompous martyr-
like air. Ier face cleared up as she read the document, however. The idea
of sharing poerty and privtion in company with the beloved object, is,

ns we have before suid, far from being disagroeable to a warm-hearted
woman. The notion wass actually pleasant to little Amclia. Then, as usual,
she was ashmed of herself for feeling happy at such nn indecorous moment,
nnd checked her pleasure, saying demurely, ` O, George, how your poor
heart must bleed nt the idea of being separated from your papa.''
`'It loes,'' said George, with an agonised eountenance
`` But he can't be angry with you long,'' she continued.  Nobodly
eould, I'm sure. le must forive you, my dearest, kindest husbanud.
O, I shall never forgive myself if he does not,''
 What vexes me, my poor Lmmy, is not my misfortne, but yours,''
George said. ``I don't cre for u little poverty; and I think, without
vanity, I 've talents enough to make my own way.''
That you hae,'' interposed his wife, who thought that war shoull
cease, and her husband should be made a genernl instantly.
 Yes, I shall make my wy as well as another,'' Osborne went on;
`but you, my dear girl, how can I bear your being deprived of the com
forts and station in society which my wife had a right to expectP Mg
dearest girl in barracks; the wife of a soldier in a marching regiment;
subjeet to all sorts of annoyance and privutionl It makes me miserable,''
Lmmy, quite at ease, as this was her husband's only cause of disquiet,
took his hand, and with n radiant face and smile began to warble that
stanza from the favourite song of e Wapping Old Stairs,'' in which the
heroine, after rebuking her Tom for inattention, promises ``his trowsers ta
mend, and his grog too to make,'' if he will be constant and kind, and not
forsake her. `Besides,'' she said, after a pause, during which sho
looked as pretty and happy as any young woman eed, `` isn't two thou-
sand pounds an immese deal of money, CGeorge''
George laughed at her naivete; and finally they went down to dinner,
Amelia clinging on George's arm, still wurbling the tune of ` Wapping Old
Btairs,'' and more pleased and light of mind than she ad been for some
dsys past.
Thus the repast, which at length came off, instead of being dismal, was
an exceedingly brisk and merry one. The excitement of the eampaign
counteracted in George's mind the depression occasioned by the disin-
heriting letter. Dobbin still kept up his character of rattle. He amused
the company with acecounts of the army in Belgium, whero nothing but
fetes and gaiety nnd fashion were going on. Then, having a particular
end in viow, this dexterous captain proeeeded to deseribe Mrs. Mjor
O'Dowd, packing her own and her Major's wardrobe, and how his best
epsulets had been stowed into a teas canister, whilst her oi famous
yellow turban, with the bird of paradise wrapped in brown paper, was
lockel up in the Major's tin coeked-hat case, and wondered what effeet it
wonld have at the French king's court at Ghent, or the great military
balls at Brussels.
Ghent 1 Brusselsl'' oried out Amelia with a sdden shock and start.
Is the regiment ordered away, George,-is it ordered away?'' A look of
terror came over the sweet smiling fuace, and she clung to George as by nn
instinet.
 Don't be afraid, dear,'' he said good-naturelly;  '`it is but a twelve
hour's passage. It won't hurt you. You shall go, too, ELmmy.''
216
YIY FAIB.
I intend to go,'' said Becky, ` 'm on the staff. General Tufto isa
great flirt of mine. Is'nt he, Rawdon''
Rawdon laughed out with his usual ronr. William Dobbin flushed up
quite red. ` She cnn't go,'' he said; `` think of the-of the danger,'' he
was going to add; but had not all his conversation during dinner-time
tended to prove there was none Ie became ery confused and silent.
I must and will go,'' Amelia cried with the greatest spirit ; and George,
applauding her resolution, patted her under the chin, and askel all the per-
sous present if they ever aaw such a termagant of a wife, and agreel thnt
the lady shoull bear him company.  We'll have Mrs. O'Dowd to chaperon
you,'' he said. What cared she so long as her hushand was near her ?
Thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was juggled nway. Though
war and danger were in store, war and danger might not befal for months
to come. There was a respite at any rate, which made the timid little
Amelia almost as lappy as a full reprieve wonuld have done, and which even
Dobbin owned in his heart was very welcome. For, to be permitted to see
her was now the greatest privilege and hope of his life, and he thought with
himself secretly how he woull wntch and proteet her. I wouldn't hase
let her go if I had been marriel to her, he thought. But George was the
master, and his friend did not think fit to remonstrate.
Putting her arm round her friend's waist, Rebecc at length carried
Amelia off from the dinner-table where so much busiuess of importauce
had been discussed, and left the gentlemcn in a highly exhilarated state,
drinking and talking very gnily.
In the course of te evening Rawdon got a little family-note from his
wife, which altlough he crumpled it up and burnt it instantly in the candle,
we had the good luck to read over Rcbecca's shoulder. ` Grent news,''
she wrote.  Mrs. Bute is gone. Get the money fromn Cupid to-night,
as he'll be off to-morrow most likely. Mind this.-R,'' So when the little
company was about adjourning to coffee in the women's apartment, Raw-
don touched Osborne on the clbow, and said gracefully, '` I sy, Osborne,
my boy, if quite convenient, I'll trouble you for thnt 'ers small trile,'' It
was not quite convenient, but nevertheless George gave him a considerable
present instalment in bank notes from his pocket-book, and a bill on his
agents at a week's date, for the remaining sum.
This matter arranged, George, nd Jos, and Dobbin, leld a couneil of
war over their cigars, and agreed that a general move should be made for
London in Jos's open carriage the next day. Jos, I think, would have
prefcrrel staying until Rawdon Crawley quitted righton, but Dobbin
and Gdcorge overruled him, and he agreed to cnrry the party to tow,
nnd ordered four horses, as became his dignity. With these they set off
in state, after breakdast, the next day. Amelia had risen very early in the
morniug, and packed her little trunks with the greatest alacrity, while
Osborne lay in bed deploring that she had not a mnid to help her. Shc
was only too glad, howeser, to perform this office for herself. A dim
ueasy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already; and although
they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we know what
jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other virtues of her sex.
esides these characters who are coming and going away, we must

remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;
Miss Crawley, namely, und the suite in attendanee upon her. Now,
nlthough Rebeces and her husband were but at a few astones' throw of the
lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawley occupied, the old ldy's door
remained s pitilessly closed to tlem as it had been heretofore in London.
As long as she remained by the side of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bute
Crawley took care that her beloved Matilla should not be agitated by a
meeting with her nephew. When the spinster took her drive, the faithful
Mrs. Bute sate beside her in the carrisge. When Miss Crawley took the
air in a chair, Mrs. Bute marehed on one side of the vehile, whilst honest
Briggs occupied the other wing. And if they met Rawdon and his wife
by chance-although tle former constantly und obsequiously took off his
hat, the Miss-Crawley party pssed him by with such a frigid and killing
inlifference, that Rawdon began to despair.
We might as well be in London as here,'' Captain Rawlon often sai,
with n downcast air.
` A comfortable inn in Brighton is better than a spunging-house in
Chaneery Lane,'' his wife answered, who was of a more cheerful tempera-
ment. " Think of those two aides-de-camp of Mr. Moses, the sheriff'a.

atupid, but Mr. Jos and Captain Cupid are better companions than Mr.
Moses's men, HRawdon, my love.''
I wonder the writs haen't followed me down here,'' Rawdon con-
tinued, still desponding.
 When they do, we 'll find means to give them the slip,'' snid dnuntless
little Beeky, and further pointed out to her husband the great comfort
nnd advnntage of meeting Jos nnd Osborne, wlose acquaintanee had
brouglt to Rawdon Crawley a most timely little supply of ready money.
 1t will hardly be enough to pay the inn bill,'' grumbled the Guardsman.
 Why need we pay it'' said the lady, who had an answer for every-
thing.
Through Rawlon's valet, who still kept up a trifling acquaintanee with
the male inhubitants of Miss Crawley's servnnts' hall, and was instructed
to treat the coachman to drink whenever they met, old Miss Crawley's
movoments were pretty well known by our young couple; and Rebecca
luckily bethought herself of bcing unwell, and of calling in the same
upothecary who was in attendance upon the spinster, so that their inform-
ntion was on the whole tolerbly complete. Nor was Miss Briggs,
although forced to adopt a hostile nttitude, secretly inimical to Rawdon
andl his wife. She was naturally of a kindly and forgiving disposition.
Now that the cause of jealousy was removel, her dislike for Rebecca dis-
appeared also, and she remembered tle latter's invariable good words and
good humour. And, indeed, she and Mrs. Firkin, the lady's-maid, and
the whole of Miss Crawley's household, secretly gronned under the tyranny.
of the triumphant Mrs. Bute.
As often will be the case, that good but imperious woman pushed her
advantages too far, and her successes quite unmereifully. She had in
the course of a few wedks brought the invalid tbo uch a state of helpless
docility,,that the poor soul yielded herself entirily to her sister's orders,
nnd did not even dare to complsin of her slavery to Briggs or Firkin,
Mr. Bute measured out the glasses of wine which Miss Craley was
daily allowed to take with irresistible accuracy, gretly to the annoyance
of Firkin and the butler, who found themselves deprived of control over
even the Sherry-bottle. She apportioned the eweet-brcads, jellies,
chickens; their quntity and order. Night and noon and morning she
brought the abominable drinks ordainad by the Dottor, and made her
patient swallow them with so affecting an obedience, that Firkin said my
poor Missus du take her physic like a lamb. She presoribel the drive in
the carriage or the ridc in the chair, and, in a word, ground down the old
lady in her convalescenee in sueh a way as only belongs to your proper-
managing, motherly, momal womnu. If ever the patient faintly resisted,
and pleaded for a little bit more inner or a little drop less medicine, the
nurse threntened her with instantaneous death, when Miss Crawley in-
stantly gave in,. ` She's no spirlt lft. in her,'' Firkin remarked to Briggs;
``she aint ave called me a fool these three weeks.'' Finally, Mrs. Bute
had made up er mind to dismiss the aforesid honest lady's-maid, Mr,
Bowls tle large confidential man, and Briggs herself, and to send for her
daughters from the Reetory, prcvious to removing the denr invalid bodily
to ueen's Crawley, when an odious aecident happened whieh called her
uway from dutics so pleasing. The Reverend Bute Crawley her husband,

riding home one night, fell with his horse and brokc his collar-bone. Fever
and inflammntory symptos set in, and Mrs. Bute was foreed to lenve
usseex. for ampshire. As soon as ever Bute was restored she promised
to return to her dearest friend, and depurted, lenving the strongest injunc-
tions with the householld regarding their behaviour to their mistress; anl
as soon as she got into the Southampton couach, there was such a jubilec and
sense of relief in all Miss Crawlcy's house, as the company of persons
nsscmbled there had not experienced for many a week before. That very
day Miss Crawley left off her nfternoon dose of melicine: thnt afternoon
Bowls opened an inlependent bottle of Sherry for himnself anl MIrs. Firkin :
that night Miss Crawley and Miss Briggs indulged in a game of picquet
instead of one of Porteus's sermons. It was ns in the old nursery-story,
when the stick forgot to bent the dog, and tho whole course of events
unlerwent a peaeeful and happy revolution.
At a very early hour in the morning, twice or thrice a week, Miss Briggs
used to betake herself to ns bathing-machine, and disport in the water in n
flannel gown, and an oilskin cap. Rebeeca, as we have seen, wras aware of'
this circumstance, and though she did not attempt to storm riggs us shc
had threatened, and actually dive into that lady's presence and surprisc
her under the sucredness of the awning, Mrs., kawdon determined to
attack Briggs as she ceame away from her bath, refreshed and invigoratel
hy her dip, and likely to be in good humour.
So, getting p very early the next morning, Becky brought thce
telescope in their sitting-room, which fuced the seas, to bear upon the
bathing-machines on the beach; saw Briggs arrive, enter her box, and put
out to sea; nnd was on the shore just ns the nymph of whom she came in
quest stepped out of the little carnvan on to the shinles. It was u pretty
picture: the beach; tle hathing-women's faces ; the long line of roeks and
building were blushing and bright in the sunshine. Rebecca wore a kinl,
tender smile on her fce, and was holding out her pretty white hand as
Briggs emerged from the hoxr. What conuld Briggs do but accept the
salutation '
MIiss Sh-, Mrs. Crawley,'' she said.
Mrs, Crawley seized her hand, pressed it to her henrt, and with a sud-
den impulse, flinging her arms round bBriggs, kissed her affeetionately.
'Dear, dear friend1'' she sid, with n touch of such natural feeling, that
Miss Briggs of course at once began to melt, and even the bathing-wonan
wss mollitied.
Rebecca found no diffieulty in engsging Briggs in a long, intimate,
and delightful conversntion. very thing that had passed since the morn-
ing of HBeeky's sudden departure from Miss Crawley's house in Park
Lane up to the present lay, and Mrs. Bute's happy retreat, was discussed
and deseribed by Briggs. All Miss Crawley's symptomns, nnd the particu-
lars of ler illness and medical treatment, were narrated by the confidunte
with that fulness and accuracy which women delight in. About their
eomplaints and their doctors do ladies oer tire of talking to each other ?
Briggs did not on this oceasion; nor did Rebeccn weary of listening. She
was thankful, truly thankful, thast the dear kind Briggs, that the faithful,
the invaluable Firkin, had been permitted to remain with their benefactres

tlrough her illness. Heaven bless herl though she, Rebecca, had seemed
to act undutifully towards Miss Crawley; yet was not her fault a natural
and exscusable one? Could she help giving her hand to the man who had
won hcr henrt Briggs, the sentimental, could only turn up her eyes to
henven at this appeal, and heave a sympathetic sigh, and think that she,
too, had gien away her affections long years ago, and own that Rebecea
was no ery great criminul.
Cnn I ever forget her who so befriended the friendless orphanP No,
tlough she has cast me off,'' the luatter said,  ``I shall never cease to love
ler, and I would devote my life to her service. As my own benefuactress,
ns my beloved Rawdon's adored relative, I love and admire Miss Crawley,
dear Miss Briggs, beyond any woman in the world, nnd next to her I love
nll those who nre faithful to her. IT would never hae treated MIiss
Crawley's fithful friends as that olious desiguing Mrs. Bute had done.
Rawdon, who was all heart,'' Rebecea continued, `` although his outwnrd
manners might secm rough and careless, had said a hundred times, with
tears in his eyes, that he blessed Heaven for sending his dearest Aunty two
such admirable nurses as her attached Firkin and her nadmirable Miss
DBriggs. Shoull the machinations of the horrible Mrs. Bute end, as she
too much fearel they would, in banishing everybody that Miss Craw-
ley loved from her side, and leaving that poor lndy a victim to those
harpics at the Rectory, Rebecca besought her (Miss bBriggs) to remember,
that her own home, humble as it was, was always open to receive lBriggs.
Denr fienl,'' she exclaimed, in a transport of enthusiasm, '` some hcnrts
can uerer forget benefits; all women are not Bute CrawleysI hough why
should I complain of her,'' Rebeeca added; `` though I have been her tool
and the victim to her arts, do I not owe my dearest Rawdon to ler 2''
And Ilebeccn unfolded to Briggs all Mrs. Bute's conluct at Gueen's
Crauley, which, though unintelligible to her then, was clearly enough
explained by the events now,-now that the attachment had sprung up
which AIrs. Bute had encouraged by a thousand artifices,-now tht tso
innocenut people had fallen into the snares which she had laid for tlem,
nnd loved and married and been ruined through her schemes.
It was all very true. Driggs saw the stratagems as cleuarly as possible.
Mrs. Bute had made the match between Rawdon anl ebeccu. et,
though the latter was a perfectly innocent victim, Miss Briggs coull not
lisguise from her friend her fenr that Miss Crawley's attections were
hopelessly cstranged from ebecca, and thnat the old lady would never
1orgive hcr nephew for making so imprudent a marriage.
On this point Rebeccn had her own opinion, and still kcpt up a good
heart. If Miss Crawley did not forgive them at present, sheight ant least
relent on a future day. Even now, there was only thut puling, sickly Pitt
Crnwley between awdon and a baronetey; and shlould anything happen
to the former, all would be well. At all eents, to hnve Mrs. HBute's
designs exposed, and herself well abused, was a satisfaction, and might bc
ndvantageous to awdon's interest; and Rebecca, after an hour's chat
with her recovercd friend, left her with the most tender demonstratious of
regard, nnd quite assured that the conversation they had had togethcr
would be reported to Miss Crawley before many hours were over.
A NOVEL YITHOUT A HERO.

This interview endel, it became full time for Rebecea to return to her
inn, where all the party of the previous dny were assembled at a farewell
brenkfast. Rebeeca took such a tender leae of Amelia as became two
women who loved each other as sisters; and having used her handkerchief
plentifully, and hung on her friend's neck as if they were parting for ever, and
waved the handkerchief (which was quite dry, by the wny) out of window,
as the curriage drove off; she came back to the breakfast-table, and
nte some prawns with n good deal of nppetite, considering her emotion;
nd while she was munching these delicacies, explained to Rnwdon whnt
had occurred in hcr morning walk between herself and Briggs. Her hopes
were very high: sle mado ler husband share them. She generually suc-
cceded in making her husband share all her opinions, whether melancholy
or cheerful.
 You will now, if you please, my denr, sit down at the writing-tnblc

rapidity : but there the gallant officer's imagination failed him. IIe
mumbled the enl of hs pen, and looked up in his wife's face. She could
ot help laughing at his rueful countenance, and, marching up and down
the room with her hands behind her, the little woman began to dictante a
letter, which he took down.
` Before quitting the country and commencing a cumpaign, which very

Let me, let me eee you before I go. A few weeks or months hence it msy
be too late, anl I oannot bear the notion of quitting the country without a
kind word of fnrewell from you.''
She won't reeognize my style in tat,'' said Becky. `I made the sen-
tenoes short and brisk on purpose.'' And this authentic missive was dis-
patched under cover to Miss bBriggs.
Old Miss Crawley laughed when bBriggs with grest mystery handed her
over this candid and simple statement.  We may read it now Mrs. Butc
is uway,'' she said. `' Head it to me, Briggs.''
When Briggs had read the epistle out, her patroness laughed more.
Don't you see, you goose,'' she suid to Briggs, who professed to be much
touched by the honest affection which pervaded the composition, ``Don't
you see that Bawdon never wrote a word of it. Ie never wrote to me
without asking for money in his life, and all his lettors are full of bad
spelling, and dnshes, and bad grammar. It is that little serpent of a
goveress who rules him.'' They are all alike, Miss Crawley thought in
her leart. They all want me dead, and aro lankering for my money.
I don't mind seeing Rawdon,'' she added, after n pause, and in a tone
of perfeet indiffereuce.  I had just as soon shake hauds with him as
not. Provided there is no scene, why slouldn't we meetf I don't
mind. But human patience has its limits; and mind, my denr, I respeet-
fully decline to receive Mrs. Rawlon-I can't support tat quite''-anl Miss
riggs was fain to be ceontent with this half-message of conciliation; and
thought that the best method of bringing tha oll lady and her nephew
together, was to warn Rawdon to be in waiting on the Clif, when Miss
Crawley went out for her air in her chair.
There they met. I don't know whether Miss Crawley had any private
feeling of regar:l, or emotion upon secing her old favourite; but she held out
a couple of fingers to him with as smiling and good-humoured an air, as il
they had met only the day before. And as for awlon, he tured as red
as scarlet, and wrung off Briggs's hund, so great was his rapture and his
confusion at the meeting. Perhaps it was interest that moved him: or
perhaps affection: perhaps he was touched by the change which the illness
of the last weeks had wrought in his aunt.
IThe old girl has always acted like n trump to me,'' he said to lis
wife, as he narrated the iuterview, `` anl I felt, you know, rather queer,
annd that sort of thing. I walked y the side of the what-dy'e-eall-'em,
yo know, and to hcr own door, where Bowls came to help her in.
And I wanted to go in very much, ouly-''
 2on did't go in, Rawdon l'' screamed his wife.
 No, my dear, I 'm hanged if I wasn't afraid when it cme to tlc
psint.''
 You fooll you ouglt to have gone in, anl uever come out again,''
Ilebeccn said.
Don't call me names,'' sni the big guardsman, sulkily.  Perhaps I
wes a fool, Becky, but you shouln't say so;'' and he gve his wifea
look, such as his countenance could wear when angered, and such ns
was not pleasant to face.
A NOYEL WITOT A HEB0.
 Well, dearest, to-morrow you must be on the look-out, and go and
see her, mind, whether she asks you or no,'' Rebecca said, trying to
oothe her angry yoke-mate. On which he replied, that he would do
exasctly as he liked, aud would just thnk her to keep a civil tongue in
her head-and the wounded husband went away, and passed the forenoon
at the billiard-room, sulky, silent, and suspicious.
But before the night was over he wss compelled to gie in, and ow,
as usal, to his wife's superior prudence and foresight, by the most mela-
choly coufirmation of the presentimeuts which she had regarding the
consequenees of the mistake which he hnd made. Miss Crawley wst
have had some emotion upon seeing him and shaking hands with him after
so long a rupture: She mused upon the meeting a considerable time.
`'Bawdon is getting very fat and old, riggs,'' she suid to her eompa-
nion. `` His nose has bccome red, and he is exeeedingly conrse in oppear-
ance. Iis marriage to that woman has hopelessly vulgarised him. Mrs.
Bute always said they drank together; and I have no doubt they do.
Yes: he smelt of gin abominably. I remarked it. Din't youf''
In vain Briggs interposed, that Mrs. Bute spoke ill of everybody : and,
as far as a person in er humble position could judge, ss an-
`An artful designing woman Yes, so she is, and she does speak ill
of every one,-but I am certain that woman has made Rawdon drink. All
those low people do--''
`He was very much affectel at seeing you, Mn'am,'' the companion
said ; `` and I am sure, when you remember that he is going to the field ol
dnger--''
How much money has he promised you, Briggs '' the old spinstei
eried out, working hcrself into n nerous rage-''there now, of course you
begin to cry. I hate soenes. Why am I always to be worriel Go and
cry up in your own room, and send Firkin to me,--no, stop, sit down and
blow your nose, and leave off crying, nnd write a letter to Captain Crawley.''
Poor Briggs went nnd placed herself obediently at the writing-book. Its
leaves were blotted all oer with relics of the firm, strong, rapid hand-
writing of the spinster's late amanuensis, Mrs. Bute Crawley.
``Begin `My lear sir,' or `' Dear sir,' that will be better, and say you ar
lesired by Mrs. Crawley-no, by Miss Crawley's medical an, by Mr.
Creamer, to state, that my health is such that all strong emolions would
be dangerous in my present delicate condition-and that I must decline
any family discussions or intecrvicws whatever. And tank him for coming
to Brighton, and so forth, and beg him not to stay any longer on my
account. And, Miss Briggs, you may add that I wish him a on oyge,
and that if he wil take the trouble to call upon my lawyer's in Grays Inn
Square, he will find therc a communication for him. Yes, that will do;
and that will make him leac Brighton.'' The enevolent lriggs penned
this sentence with the utmost satisfction.
eTo seizc upon me the very day after Mrs. Bute was gone,'' the old
lady prattled on; ``it was too indecent. Briggs, uy dear, write to Mrs.
Crawley, and say ale nccdn't come back. No-she needn't-and sh
shan't-and I won't be a slave in my own house-and I won't be stared

and choked with poison. They all want to kill me-all-ull''-and with
this the lonely old woman burst into a seream of hysterical tears.
The last scene of her dismal Vanity Fair comedy was fast approaching;
the tawdry lamps were going out oue by one; and the dark curtain was
almost ready to descend,
Thnt final paragraph, which referred Rawdon to Miss Crawley's solicitor
ia London, and which Briggs had written so good-naturedly, consoled the
dragoon anl his wife somewhat, after tleir first blank disappointment, on
reading the spinster's refusal of a reconciliation. And it efeeted the pur-
pose for which the old lady hasd caused it to be written, by making
llawdon very eager to get to London.
Out of Jos's losings and George Osborne's bnnk-notes, he paid his
bill at the inn, the landlord whereof does not probably know to this day
how doubtfully his account once stood. For, as s general sends his bag-
gge to the rear before an action, Rebecca hnd wisely packed up all tleir
chief valuubles and sent them off under cnre of George's serant, who
went in charge of the trunks on the coach back to London. Rawdon and
lis wife returned by the same conveyance next day.
I should have liked to see the old girl before we went,'' Rawdon said.
She looks so eut up anl altered thut I 'm sure she cn't lst long. I
wonder what sort of a cleque I shall have at Waxy's. Two hundred-it
can't be less than two hundred,-hey Becky P''
In consequence of the repeated visits of the gentlemen whose portraits
nve been taken in a preceding page, Rawdon and his wife did not go
Maek to their lodgings at hBrompton, but put up at an inn. Early the next
morning, Rebecca had an opportunity of seeing them as she skirted that
suburb on her rond to old Mrs. Sedley's house at Fulham, whither she
went to look for her lenr Amelia and her Brighton friends. They were all
off to Chatham, thence to larwich, to take shipping for Belgium with the
regiment-kind oll Mrs. Sedley very much depressed and tearful, solitary.
Returning from this vieit, Rebecca founl her husband, who had been off ta
Gray's Iun, and learnt his fute. He came bnck furious.
`By Jove, Becky,'' says hc, ``she's only given me twenty pounds''
Though it told aguinst themselves, the joke was too good, and Beck
burst out laughing at Rawdon's discomfiture.

N quitting Briglton, our friend George
ns became a person of rank and fashion
travelling in a barouche with four horses,
drove in state to a fine hotel in Caven-
lish quare, where a suite of splendid
rooms, and a table magnificently fur-
nished with plate and surrounded by a
half-dozen of black and silent waiters,
was ready to receive the young gentle-
nan and his bride. George did the
honours of the place with a princely air
to Jos and Dobbin; and Amelia, for the
first time, nd witl exceeding shyuess
nd timidity, presided at what George
George pooh-poohed the wine and bullied the wniters royally, nnd
Jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction. Dobbin helpcd him to
it; for the laly of the house, before whom the tureen was placed, was so
ignorant of the contents, that she was gboing to help Mr. Sedley without
bestowing upon him either calipash or calipee.
The splendour of the entertainment, and the apartments in wlich it
was given, alarmel Mr. Dobbin, who remonstrated after dinner, when
Jos was asleep in the great chair. But, in vain he cried out against the
cnormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an arehbishop. I'e
nlways been accustomed to travel like a gentleman,'' George said, `" anl,
dnamme, my wife slall travel like a lady. As long as there's a shot in the
locker, sle shall want for notling,'' said the generous fello. quite
pleased with himself for his magnificence of spirit. Nor did Dobbinu
try and convince him, that Amelia's happiness was not centred in
turtle-soup.
A while after dinner, Amclia timidly expressed a wish to go anl see
her mamma, at Fulham: which permission George granted her with somc
grumbling. And she tripped away to her enormous bed-room, in the
centre of which stool the enormous unereal bed, `that the Emperor
Halixander's sister slep in when the allied sufferings was ere,' and put
on her little bonnet and shawl with the utmost eagerness and pleasure.
George was still drinking claret when sle returned to the dining-room,

she askcd him. No; he `dearest' had `business' that night. His mn

door of the hotel, Amelia male George a little disappointed curtsey after
looking vainly into his face onee or twice, and went sadly down the great
staircase, Cnptain Dobbin after, who handed her into the vehicle, and
saw it drive away to its destination. The very valet was ashamed of
mentioning the address to the haekncy-coachman before the hotel-waiters,
and promised to instruct him when they got further on.
Dobbin walked home to his old quarters at the Slaughters', thinking
very likely that it would be delightful to be in that hackney-coach, ulong
with Mrs. Osborne. George was evidently of quite a different taste; for
when he had taken wine enough, he went off to half-price at the play, to
see Mr. Kenn perform in Shylock. Captain Osborne was a great lover of
the drama, and had himself performed high-comedy characters with great
distinction in several garrison theatrical entertainments. Jos slept on
until long after dark, when he woke up with na start at thc motions of
his servant, who was remoing and emptying the decanters on the table;
and the hackme-coach stand was again put into requisition for a carriage
to convey this stout hero to his lolgings and bed.
Mrs. Sedley, you may be sure, clasped hcr daughter to her henrt with
nll maternal eagerness and anffection, ruing out of the door as the carriage
rew up before the little garden-gate, to welcome the weeping, trembling,
young brile. Old Mr. Clapp, who was in his shirt-sleceves, trimming the
grden-plot, shrank baek alarmed. The Irish servant-lass rushced up from
the kitchen and smiled a God bless you.' Amelia could hardly walk
nlong the flags and nup thc steps iuto the parlour.
1Iow the floodgates were opened and mother and danghter wept, when
they were together embracing eaeh other in this sanectuary, may readily be
imagined by every rcader who possesscs the least sentimental turn. When
don't ladies weep? At wht occsion of joy, sorrow, or other business of
lifce? and, nafter such an evcnt as a marriage, mother nnd daughter ere
surely at liberty to give way to an sensibility which is as tender as it is
refreshing. About a question of marriage I hnve seen women who hnte
ench other kiss and cry together quite foudly. How much more do they
feel when they love. Good mothers are married over agnin at their
dnughters' weddings: and as for subsequent events, who does not kno
how ultra-maternal grandmothers are?-in fact a woman, until she is a
grandmother, does not often really kuow whnt to be a mother is. Let us
respect Amelia and her mamma whispering and whimpering and Iaughing
and crying in the parlour and the twilight. Oll Mr. Sedley did. He
had not divined who was in the crriage when it drove up. Ie had not
flown out to meet his daughtcr, though he kissed her very warly when she
entered the room (where he was oceupied, as usual, ith his papers and
tapes and statemeuts of naccounts), and nafter sitting with the mother and
laughter for a short time, he very wisely left the little apartment in their
nossession.
George's valet was looking on in a very supercilious manner nt Mr., Clapp
in his shirt-sleeves, watering his rose-bushes. IIc took off his hat, how-
evcr, with much condescension to Mr. Sedley, who asked news about his
son-in-law, and about Jos's carriage, and whether his horses hal been
down to lBrighton, and about that infernal traitor Bonaparty, and the war;

Sedley said, '`and here's something to drink your health when you get

There were but nine days past since Mmeli lad left that little cottage
and home-and yet how far off the time seemed since she had bidlen it
farewell. What a gulf lay between ler and tllat past life. She could
look back to it from her present standing-place,. and contemplate, almost
as another being, the young nnmarried girl absobed in her love, having
no eyes but for one special object, receiving parantal affection if not nn-
gratefully, at least indifferently, and as if it were her due-her whole
heart and thoughts beut on the accomplishment af one desire. The review
of those days, so latcly gne yet so far away, toultd her with shame; and
the aspect of the kind parents filled her with tender remorse. Wns the
prize gained-the heasen of life-and the winner still doubtful nnd un-
sntisfied As lis lra and heroine pass tle mntrimonial barrier, the
novelist generally dsps te curtain, as if the drama were over then : the
doubts and struggles of oe ended: as if, once landcd in the marriage
country, all were green and pleasant there: and wife aud husband had
nothing but to link each other's arms together, and wander gently down-
wards towards old age in hanpy and perfect fruition. But our little Amclia
was just on the bank of hcr new country, and was already looking
anxiously back towards the sad friendly figures waving farewell to hr across
the stream, from the other distant shore.

In honour of the young bride's arrival, her mother thoughlt it necessary
to prepare lI don't know what festie entertainment, and after the first
ebullition of talk, took leare of Mrs. George Osborne for a while, and dived
down to the lower regions of the house to a sort of kitchen-purlour
(oeeupied by Mr. and Mrs. Clapp, and in the evening, when her dishes
were wasled and her curl-papers removed, by Miss Flanuigan the Irish
servant), there to take measures for the preparing of a magnificent orna-
mented tea. All people have their ways of expressing kindness, and it
seemed to Mrs. Sedley that n muffin and a quantity of orange marmalade
spread out in a little cut-glass saueer would be peculiarly agreeable refresh-
ments to Amelia in her most interesting situation.
While these delicacics were being transacted below, Amelia, leaving the
lrawing-room, walked up stairs and found herself, she scarce knew how,
in the little room wlich she had occupied before her marriage, and in that
very chair in wlich sle had passed so many bitter hours. She sank back
in its arms as if it were an old friend ; and fell to thinking over the past
week, and the life beyond it. Already to be lookiug sadly and vaguely
back : always to be pining for something which, when obtainel, hrought
loubt and sadness rather than pleasure : here was the lot of our poor
little oreature, nnd harmless lost wanderer in the great struggling crowds
of Vanity Fair.

whieh she had knelt before marriage. Did she own to herself how different
the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?
It requires many many years-and a man must be very bad indeed-
before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession.
Then Rebecea's twinkling grcen eyese and baleful smile lighted upon her,
and flled her with dismay. And so she sate for awhile inlulging in her
usunl mood of selfish brooding, in that very listless melancholy attitude in
which the honest maid-servant had found her, on the day when she brought
up the letter in which George renewed his ofer of marriage.
She looked at the little wlite bed, which had been hers n few days
before, and thought she woull like to slcep in it that night, and wake, as
iormerly, with her mother smiling over her in the morning. Then she
tlought with terror of the great funereal dmssk pavilion in the vast anl
dingy state bed-room, which was awaiting her at the granl hotel in Caven-
lish Square. Dear little white bed! how many a long night had she
wept on its pillowI How she hnd despaired and hoped to die there; and
now were not all her wishes accomplished, and the lover of whom she hnd
despaired her own for eer? Kind motherl how patiently aul tenderly
she hal watched round that bed1 She went nnl knelt down by the bed-
side; and there this wounded and timorous, but gentle and loving soul,
sought for consolation, where as yet, it must be ownel, our little girl hal
but seldom looked for it. Love had been her faith hitherto; and the sad,
bleeling, disappointed heart, began to feel the wnnt of another consoler.
Have we a right to repeat or to overhear her prayers These, brotler,
are secrets, and out of the domain of Vanity Fair, in which our story lies.
But this may be said, thnt when the ten was finally announced, our
young lady came down stairs a great deal more cheerful ; that she did not
desponld, or deplore her fate, or think about George's coldness, or Rehecca's
eyes, as she had been wont to do of late. She went lown stairs, and
kissel her father and mother, and talked to the old gentleman, and made
him more merry than he had been for many a day. She sate down at
the pinno which Dobbin had bought for her, and sung over all her father's
fnourite old songs. Sho pronounceed the tca to be excellent, and praised
the exuisite taste in which the marmalade was arrangcd in the saucers.
Anl in determining to make everybody else happy, she fond herself so;
and was sound asleep in the great funerenl pavilion, and only woke up withi
a smile when Gdeorge arrived from the theatre.
For the next day, George had more important `business' to trnnsact
than that which took him to see Mr. Kean in Shylock. Immediately on
his arrial in London he had written off to his father's solicitors, signilying
his royal pleasure that an interview should take place between them on
the morrow. His hotel losscs at billiards and cards to Cnptain Crawley had
almost drained the young man's purse, which wanted replenishing before
he set out on his trnvels, and he had no resource but to infringe upon the
two tlousand pounds which the attorneys were commissioned to pay over
to him. He had a perfect holief in his own mind that his father would
relent before very long. IIow could any parent he obdurate for a lcngth of
time against such a paragon as he was If his mere psst and pcrsonal
230

merits did not succeed in mollifying the father, George determinel thnt he
would distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that
the old gentleman must give in to him. And if not: Bahl tle world
was before him. Hlis luck might change at cnrls, nnd there was a lenl of
spending in two thousand pounds.
So he scnt off Amelin once more in a cnrrinage to her mamma, with strict
orders and carte blanche to the two ladies to purchse everything requi-
site for a lady of Mrs. George Osborne's fashion, who was going on a
foreign tour. They hal but one duy to complete the onutfit, and it my be
imagined that their business therefore oecupied them pretty fully. In a
carriage oee more, bustling about from nilliner to linendraer, escorted
buack to the cnrringe by obsequious shopmen or polite oners, MIrs. Sedley
was herself again almost, and sincerely hapny for the first time since thcir
uisfortunes. Nor was MIrs. Amelia at all ubove the pleasure of ehopping,
and brgaining, and seeing and buying pretty things. (Wonld any man,
the most philosophic, give twopence for a woman wlo wns) She gac
herself a little treat, obedient to her husband's orders, and purchased a
quantity of lady's gear, showing a great deual of taste nnd elegant diseern-
ment, ns all the shopfolks said.
And about thewur that was ensuing, MIrs. Osborne wns uot much alarmed;
Bonaparty was to be erushed almost without a struggle. Margate packets
were sailing every day, filled with men of fashion and ladies of note, on their
way to Brussels anl Ghent. TPeople wcre going not so nuch to a war as
to a fashionuble tour. The newspapers laughed the wretched upstart and
swindler to scorn. Such a Corsican wretch as that withstand the armies
of Europe and the genius of the imortal Wellingtonl Amelia held im
in utter contempt; for it needs not to be snid that this soft and gentle
ereature took her opinions from those people who surrounded her, such
fidelity being much too humble-minded to think for itself. Well, in a word,
she and her mother performed a great duy's slopping, and she acquitted
herself with considernble liveliness nnd credit on this her first appearance
in the genteel world of London.
George meanwhile, with his hat on one side, his elbows squnred, and
is swaggering martial nir, made for Bedford Row, and stalked into the
attorney's oflices as if hc was lord of every pnle-faced clerk who was scrib-
bling thore. IIe ordered somebody to inform Mr. Higgs that Captain
Oslorne was waiting, in a fierce nnd patronizing way, as if the peilin of nn
nttorney, who hal thrice his brains, fifty times his money, and a thousaud
timcs his experienee, was a wretched underling who should instantly leave
anll his business in life to attend on tle Cnptain's plesure. He did ot
see the sneer of contempt which passed nll round the room, from the first
clerk to the articled gents, from the articlel gents to the ragged writers
and white-faced runners, in elothes too tight for them, as he sate there
tapping his boot with his cane, nnd thinking what a parcel of miserable
poor levils these wcre. Tle miseruble poor devils knew all nbout his afairs.
1hey talked about them over their pints of beer at their publio-house clubs

Perhaps George expeeted, wheu he entered Mlr. Ilggs's apartmeut, ta
find that gcutlean comissioued to give him some essage ol compro-
nise or couciliation fro his fathlr; perhaps his hauglty anl cold
demeanour was adopted as a sign of his spirit and resolution: but if so,
his fierceness was met by a chilling ceooless and indiflerence on the
attorney's part, that rendered swaggering absurd. he pretended to be
writing at a paper, when the Cnptuin eutered. `` Pry, sit down, Sir,''
said he, ``and I will attend to your little affair iu aoment. Mr. loe,

friendly couutenance of Captain Dob-
bin, who had been pacing the street
for an hour past in expectation of
his friends' nrrivnl. The Cnptain, with
shells on his frock-eoat, and a crimson
sash and sabre, presented a military
appearance, which mnde Jos quite
proul to be able to claim such an
acquaintance, and the stout civilian
hniled him with a cordiality very
different from the reception which
Jos vouchsafed to his friend in.
Brighton anl Bond Street.
Along with the Captain was Ensign
Stubble; vho, ns the barouche neared
the inn, burst out with an exclamation
of ' By Jovel what a pretty girll'' highly applanling Oslorne's choice.
Indeed, MAmclia dressed in her wedling-pelisse and pink ribbons, with a
flush in her face, occasionel by rapid travel through the open air, lookel
so fresh and prctty, as fuly to justify the Ensign's compliment. Dobbin
liked him for making it. As he stepped forward to help the lady out of
the cnrriage, Stubble saw what a pretty little hand she gave him, and
what a sweet pretty little foot came tripping down the sep. He blushed
profusely, and made the very best bow of wvhich he was capable; to which
hmelia, seeing the number of the -th regiment embroidered on the
Ensign's cap, replied with n blushing smile, and na curtsey on her part;
which finished the young Ensign on the spot. Dobbin took most kindly
to Mr. Stubble from that day, and encouraged him to tnlk about Amelin
in their private walks, and at cach other's quartcrs. It became the fashion
indeed among all the honest young fellows of the -th to adore and
admire Mrs, Osborne. IIer simple artless behaviour, and modest kindness
of demeanour, won all their unsophisticated learts; all which simplicity
nnd sweetness are quite impossible to deseribc in print. But who has
not beheld these among women, and recognized the presence of nll sorts
of qunalities in them, even thoughi they say no more to you than that
they are engaged to dance the next quadrille, or that it is very lot
wcather? George, always the champion of his regimcnt, rose immensely

in the opinion of the youth of the ecorps, by his gallantry in marrying this
portionless young creature, and by his choice of such a pretty kinl
partner.
In the sitting-room which was awaiting the travellers, Amelia, to her
surprise, found a letter addressed to Mrs. Captain Osbomne. It was a
triangular billet, on pink paper, and sealed with a dove and an olive
braneh, and a profusion of light-blue sealing wax, and it was written in a
ery large, though undecided female hand.
I's Peggy ODosd's fst,'' said Gorge, laughing. `'Inow it by the
kisses on the seal.'' And in fact, it was a note from Mrs. Major O'Dowd,
requesting the pleasure of Mrs. Osborne's company that very evening to
a small friendly party. eTou must go,'' George suid. e You will make
acquaintance with the regiment there. O'Dowd goes in command of the
regiment, and eggy goes in command of O'Dow.''
But they had not been for many minutes in the cnjoyment of Mrs.
O'Dowl's letter, when the door was flung open, and a stout jolly lady, in
a riding-habit, followed by a couple of officers of Ours, entered the room.

Sure, I couldn't stop till tay-time. Present me, Garge, my dear fellow,
to your ldy. Madam, I 'm deloighted to see ye; and to present to you
me husband, Mecjor O'Dowd;'' and with this, the jolly laly in the riding-
habit grasped Amelia's hanl very warmly, and the latter kncw at once
that the lndy wus before her whom her husbnnd had so often laughed at.
You 've often heard of me from that husband of yours,'' said tle lady
with great vivacity.
 ou 've often heard of ler,'' echoed her husband, the Mlajor.
Amelia answeered, smiling, ``that she hnd.''
:And small good he 's told you of me,'' Mrs. O'Dowd replied; alding
that ``George was a wiked divvle,''
eThat I 'll go bail for,'' said the Major, trying to look knowing, at which
George laughed; and Mrs. O'Dowd, with a tup of her whip, told the
Mnjor to be quite; and thcn requested to be presented iu for to MIrs.
Captain Osborne.
 This, my dear,'' ssid George with great grsity, ``is my sery good,
kinl, and excelleut friend, Auralia Mlargaretta, otherwise called Peggy.''
 1Faith, you 're right,'' interposed the Mjor.
. Otherwise called eggy, luady of Msjor Michael O'Dowd of our regi-
ment, and daughter of Fitzjurld Ber'sford de Burgo Malony of Glen-
nalony, County Kildnre.''
`And Muryan Squeer, Doblin,'' said the lady with calm superiority.
`And Muryan quare, sure enough,'' the Mjor whispered.
'was there ye coorted me, Meejor, dear,'' the lady said; and the
MInjor asscnted to this as to every other proposition which was mude
generally in company.
Major O' Dowd, who hal served his soereign in every quarter of theworld,
and had paid for every step in his profession by sme more than equiva-
lent act of daring and gullantry, was the most molest, silent, sheen-laced
and meek of little men, und as obedient to his wife as if he had been her
tay-boy. At the mess-table he eute silently, and rank a great deal. Whcen
full of liquor, he reeled silently home. When he spoke, it was to agreo
with everybody on every conceivable point; and he passed through life in
perlect ense anl good lumour. The hottest suns of India never heated
is temper; and the Walehern ague never shook it. He walked up to a
battery with just as much indifference as to a dinner-table; had dinel on
horse-flesl and turtle with equsl relish and appetite; and had an old
mother, Ms. O'Dowd of ODowstown indeed, whom he had never dis-
obeyed but when he ran away anl enlisted, and whcn he persisted in
marrying that odious Peggy Malony.
Peggy was one of five sisters, nnd eleven children of the noble house
of Glenmalony; but her husband, thougl her own cousin, was of the
mother's side, and so lad not the inestiahle advantage of bsing allied to
the Mloies, whom she believed to be the most famous fily in the
world. Having triedl nine seasons at Dnblin and two st Buath nnd Chel-
tenham, and not finding a partner for life, Mies Malony ordered her
cousin Mick to murry her when she was about thirty-three ycars of age;
nnd the honest fellow obeying, carried her off to the West Inlies to preside
over the ladies of the -th regiment, into whicl hce hadl just exchanged.

Belore Mrs. O'Dowd wns half an hour in Armelia's (or indeed in anyboly
else's) company, this amiable ldy told nll her birth ad pedigree to her
new friend. `` MIy denr,'' said she, good-natureuly, ``it was my intecution
that Garge should be a brother of my own, and my sister Glorvina would
have suitel hi entircly. Dut ns bygones are bygones, nnd he wns
cngaged to yourself, why, I'm determined to tuke you as a sister instead,
and to look npon you as such, nd to love you as onue of the family.
Fuaith, you've got such a nice good-natured face and way widg yu, that
I 'm sure we 'll agree; and that you 'll be an addition to our family any-
way,''
i'Deel nnd she will,'' aaid O'Dowl with an npproving air, und Amelia
felt herself not a little amused and grateful to be thus suddenly iutroduced
to so large a party of relutions,
eWe 're all good fellows here,'' the Mjor's lady continued. There's
not a regiment in the service where you 'll find a more united society nor
n more ugreeuble mess-room. There 's no quarrelling, bickering, sland-
thering, nor small talk amongst as. We all love ench other.''
 Especially Mrs. Magenis,'' suid George, laughing.
` Mrs. Cptain Magenis and me has made up, thougl her treatment of
me would bring me gray hairs with sorrow to the grue.''
`And you with such a beautiful front of blasck, Peggy my dear,'' the
Mnjor cried.
 Hould your tongue, Nick, you booby. Them husbans are ulwnys in
the way, Mrs. Osborne, my dear; anl as for my Mik, I often tell hin he
should never open his mouth but to give the word of command, or to put
meat and drink into it. I 'Il tell you about the regiment, nnd warn you
when we 're alone. Introduce me to your brother now; sure he's a miglty
fine man, anl reminds me of me cousin Dan Malony (Mnlony of Ballyma-
lony, my dear, you know, who mur'icd Ophalia Scully, of Oystherstown,
owu cousin to Lord Poldoody). Mr. Sedley, Sir, I 'm deloighted to bc
made known te ye. I suppose you'll dine at the mess to-day. (Mind
that divvle of a docther, ick, nnd whatever ye du, keep yoursalf sober for
me party this evening.)
It's the 150th gives us a farewvell dinner, my love,'' interposed thc
Major, `` but we'll easy get a crd for Mr. Sedley.''
`Bun sSimple (nsign Simple, of Ours, my dear Amelia. I forgot to
introjuiee him to ye.) Run in a hurry, witl Mra. Major O'Dowd's
complimcnts to Colonel Taish, nnd Captain Oshorne has brought his
brothernlaw down, and will bring him to the 150th mess at five o'clock
sharp-when you and lI, my tlear, will take a snack here, if you like.''
Befwore Mrs. O'Dowl's speech was concluded, the youg sign was
trotting down stairs on his commission.
 Obcdience is the aoul of tlc urmy. We will go to our duty while
Mrs. O'Dowd will stay and enlighten you, my,'' Captain Osborne said;
and the two Captains, taking each a wing of the Major, walked out with
that oflicer, grinning at each other over his hend.
Ad, now having her new friend to herself, the impetuous Mrs, O'Dowd
procecled to pour out such a quantity of information as no poor little
voun's memory could ever tax itself to bear. She told Amelia a thousand

particulars relative to the ery numerous family of which the amazed
young lady found herself a member. :Mrs. Hecavytop, the Colonel's
wife, died in Jamaiea of the yellow faver and a broken henrt comboined,
for the horrud old Colonel, with a head as bald as a cannon-ball, was
making sheep's eyes at a half-caste girl there. Mrs. Magenis, thongh
without education, was a good woman, but she had the divvle's tongue,
and would cheat her own mother at whist. Mrs. Captain Kirk must
tumn up her lobster eyes forsooth at the idea of an honest round game,
(wherein me fawther, as pious a man ns eer went to churceh, me uncle
Dane Malony, and our cousin the Bisliop, took a hand at loo, or whist,
every night of their lives). Nayther of 'em's goin with the regiment this
time,'' Mrs. O'Dowd added. Fanny Magenis stops with hcr mother, wha
sells small coal and potatoes, most likely, in Islington-town, hard by
London, though she's always bragging of her father's ships, and pointing
them out to us as they go up the river: and Mrs Kirk and her children
will stop here in Bethesda Place, to be nigh to her favourite preacher,
Dr. Ramshorn. MIrs. Bunny 's in an interesting situation-faith, and she
always is, then-and has given the Lieutenant seven already. And
Ensign Posky's wife, who joined two months belore you, my dear, has
quarl'd with Tom Posky a score of times, till you can hear 'em all over
the bar'ek, (they suy they're come to bhroken pleets, and om never
necounted for his black oi,) and sle'll go back to her mother, who keeps n
ladies' siminary at Richmond,-bad luck to her for running away from itl
Where did ye get your finishing, my dear I had moin, anl no expinee
spared, at MIadame Flanahan's, at Ilyssus Grove, Booterstown, near
Dublin, wid a Marchioness to teach us the true Parisian pronunciation,
and a retired Mejor-General of the French service to put us through the
exercise.''
Of this incongruous family our astonished Amelia founl herself all of
a sudden n member: with Mre, O'Dowd as an elder sister. She was pre-
sented to her other female relations at tea-time, on whom, as she was
quiet, good-nutured, and not too handsome, she made rather an agreeable
ipression until the arrival of the gentlemen from the mess of the l50th,
who all admired her so, that her sisters began, of course, to find fault
with her.
e I hope Osborne has sown his wild onts,'' snid Mrs. MIagenis to Mrs.
Bunny.  If a reformed rake makes a good husband, sure it's she will
have the fine chance with Garge,'' Mrs. O'Dowd, remarked to Posky, who
had lost her position as bride in the regiment, and was quite angry with
the usurper. And, as for Mrs. Kirk; the disciple of Dr. Ramshorn put
one or two leading professional questions to MAmelia, to see whether she was
awakened, whether she was a protfessing Christian and so forth, and finding
from the simplieity of MIrs. Osborne's replies that she was yet in utter
darkness, put into hcr hands three little penny books with picturcs, viz. the
Howling Wilderncss,'' tho  WVasherwoman of Wanlsworth Comnmon,''
and the `` British Soldier's best Bayonet,'' which, bent upon awakening
her before sle slept, Mrs. Kirk begged Amelia to read that night ere she
went to bed.
But all the men, like good fellows ns thcy were, ralliel round their

comrade's pretty wile, and paid her their court with soldierly gallantry.
She had a little triumph, which flushed her spirits unl made her eyes
sparkle. George wus proud of her populurity, and pleased with the
manuer (which was very gy and graceful though naive and a little timid)
with which she received the gentlemen's attentions, and answered their
compliments. And he in his uniform-how much handsomer he was than
any man in the rooml She felt that he was affectionately watching her,
and glowed with pleasure at his kinudness. ` I ill make all his friends
weleome,'' she resolved in her heart. I will love all who love him. I
will ulways try and be gay and good-humoured and make lis home
happy.''
The regiment indced adopted her with acclamation. The Cnptains
approvel, the Lieutenants applauded, tle knsigns admired. Old Cutler
the Doctor made one or two jokes, which, being professional, need not be
repeated; and Cackle, the Assistant M.bD. of Edinburgh, condescenled to
examine her upon leeterature, nnd tried her with his tlee best French
quotations. oung Stubble went about from man to man whispering,
Jove, isn't she a pretty galt'' and never took his eyes off her exeept
when the negus came in.
As for Captain DDobin, he never so much as spoke to her during the
whole evening. lBut he and Captain Porter of the 150th took home Jos
to te hotel, who was in a very maudlin state, and had told his tiger-hunt
story with greut eflect, both at tle mess-table ; and at the soiree, to Mrs.
O'Dowl in her turban and bird of paralise. IIuving put the Collector
into the lauds of his servant, Dobbin loitered about, smoking his cigar
before the inn door. George had meanwhile very carefully shawled his
wife, nnd brought her away from MIrs, O'Dowd's after a general hand-
shaking from the young officers, who accompniel her to the fy, and
cleercd that vchicle as it lroe off. So Amelia gave Dobbin her little
hand as she got out of the carriage, and rebuked im smilingly for not
haing taken any notice of her all night.
The Cnptain continued that deleterious amusement of smoking, lng
after the inn and the street were goue to bed. IIc watched the liglts
vnnish from George's sitting-room windows, and shine out in the bel-
room close ut hand. It was almost moruing when he returned to his
own quarters. IIe could henr the cheering from the slips in the river,
where the transports were already taking in their cargoes preparatory to

That period of Jos's life which now ensued was so full of incident, that
it served him for conversation for many years after, and even the tiger-
hunt story was put aside for more stirring narratives which he hnd to tell
about the great campaign of Waterloo. As soon as he had agreed to

made his appearance in a brded frock-coat and duck trowsers, with a

He suffered hugely on the voyge, during wlich the ladies were likewise
prostrate; but Amelia was brought to life aguin as the packet made
Otend, by the sight of the transports conveying her regient, which
entered the harbour almost at the same time with the Lovely Rose.
Ios went in a collapsed state to an inn, while Cuptain Dobbin escorted the
ladics, nnd then busied himself in frecing Jos's carringe and luggage from
the ship and the customhouse, for Mr, Jos was ut present without a ser-
vant, Osborne's man and his own pampered menial having conspired
together at Chatham, and refused point-blank to cross the water. This
revolt, which came very suddenly, nnd on the lst day, so alarmed Mr,
Sedley, junior, that he was on the point of giing up the cxpetition, but
Captain Dobbin (who made himself immensely officious in the business,
Ios said), rated him and laughed at him soundly: thle mustnchios werc
grown in advance, and Jos finnlly was persuaded to embark. In place
of the well-bred and well-fed London domestics, who could only speak
English, Dobbin procured for Jos's party a swartly little Belgian servant
who could speak no language at all; but who by his bustling behaiour,
and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley ns ` My lorl,'' spceily acquired
that gentleman's favour. imes are altered at Ostend now; of tle Britons
who go thither, very few look like lords, or act like those members of oun
hereditary aristocracy. They seem for the most part shabby in attire,
dingy of linen, lovers of billiards and brandy, nd cigars aud greasy
ordinaries.
But it may be said as n rule, that every ELnglishman in the Duke of
Wellington's army paid his wny. The remembrance of such a fact
surely becomes a nation of shopkeepers. It was a blessing for a com-
merce-loving country to be overrun by such an army of custoners: annd
to have such creditable wnrriors to fcel. And the country which they
came to protect is not military. For a long period of listory they have
let other people figlt thero. When the present writer went to survey
with eagle glance the field of Waterloo, we asked the conduetor of the
diligence, a portly warlike-looking veteran, whether he hud been at the
battle.  Pas si ite''-such an answer and sentiment as no Frenchman
would own to-was his reply. But on the other hnnd, the postilion who
drove us was n iscout, a son of some bankrupt Imperinl Gencral, who
necepted a pennyworth of her on the read. The moral is surely a
good one.
This flat, flourishing, easy conntry never could sve looked more rieh
and prosperous, than in that opening summer of 1815, whcn its green
fields and quiet cities were enlivened by multipkid red-coats: when its
wide claussees swnrmed with brilliant kEnglish equipages: when its
great canal-boats, gliding by rich pastures nnd pleasant quaint old vil-
lages, by old chateaux lying amongst old trees, were all crowded with
well-to-do Lnglish travellers: when the sollier who drnnk at the village

military subjeets just now, I throw out this as a good subject for the
peneil, to illustrate the principle of an honest English war. All looked as
brilliant and harmless as a Hyde Prk review. Meanwhile, Napoleon
screened behind his curtain of frontier-fortresses, was preparing for the
outbreak which ws to drive all these orderly people into fury and blood;

Everyboly had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader (for the
resolute faith which the Duke of Wellington had inspired in the whole
Lnglish nation was as intense, as that more frantic enthusiasm with which
at one time the French regardel Napoleon), the country seemed in so per-
fect a state of orderly defence, and the help at hand in case of need so near
and overwhelming, that alarm was unknown, and that our truvellers, among
whom two were uaturally of a very timid sort, were, like all the otler multi-
plied English tourists, cntirely alt case. he famous regiment, with so
many of whose officers we have made acquaintance, was drafted in cnnal-

traveller wlo coming to Belgium for a week, and travelling in one of these
boats, was so delighted with the fure there that he went backwards and
forwards ifrom Ghent to Bruges perpetually until the railroads were
invented, when he drowned himself on the last trip of the passage-boat.

lantly to the ladies.
His courage was prodigious. ` Boney attack us/'' he eried.  My
dear creature, my poor Emmy, don't be frightened. There's no langer.
The allies will be in Paris in two months, I tell you: when I'll take you
to dine in the Palais Royal, by Jove. There nre three hunlrel tlousanl
Rooshians, I tell you, now entering France by Mayence and the Rhine-
threc huudred thousand under Wittgenstein anl hBarclay de Tolly, my poor
love. You don't know military affuirs, my dcar. I do, and I tell you
there's no infantry in France can stand against looshian infantry, and no
general of Boney's that 's fit to hold a candle to Wittgenstein. Then
tiere are the Austrians, they are five hundred thousand if a man, and
they are within ten marches of the frontier by this time under Schwartzen-
berg and Prinee Clnrles. Then there are the Prooshians under tle
gallant Prince Marshal., Show mc a cnvulry clief like him now that
Murat is gone. Hcy, Mrs. O'Dowudt Do you think our little girl here
need be afraid. Is there any cause for fear, Isidor? IIey, Sir? Get
some more beer.''
Mrs. O'Dowd sail that her Glorvina was not afruaid of any man alivc
let alone a Frenchman,'' nnd tossed off a glass of bcer with a wink which
expressed her liking for the beverage.
HIaving frequently been in presence of the enemy, or, in other words,
faced the Iadies nt Cheltenham anl Bath, our friend, tle Collector, had
lost a great deal of his pristine timidity, and wns now, cspecially when
fortified witl liquor, as talktive as might be. He was rather a favourite
with the regiment, treating the young officers with sumptuosity, and
amusing them by his military airs. And as there is one well-known
regiment of the army which travels with a gout hcading the column,
whilst another is led by a deer, George said with respect to his brothler-
in-law, that his regiment marched with an elephant.
Since Amelia's introduction to the regiment, George began to be rather
ashamed of some of the company to which hc had been forced to present
her; and determined, as he told Dobbin (with what satisfaction to the
latter it need not be said), to exchange into some better regiment soon,
and to get his wife awsy from these damned vulgar womcu. But this
vulgarity of being ashamed of one's society is much more common among
men than women; (except very great ladies of fashion, who, to be sure,
indulge in it;) and Mrs. Amelia, a naturnl anl unaflected person, had
none of that nrtificial shamefaeedness which her husbnd mistook for deli-
cacy on his own part. Thus Mrs. O'Dowd hnd a cock's plume in her hat,
and a very large ``repayther'' on hecr stomach, which she used to ring on
all occnsions, narrating how it had been presented to her by her fawther, as
ahe stipt into the car'ge after her mur'ge; and these ornaments, with
other outwarl peculiarities of the Major's wife, guve excruciating agonies
to Captain Osborne, when his wife and the Major's cume in contaet;
wherens Amelia was only amused by the honest lady's eccentricities, and
not in the lenst ashamed of her company.

of middle rank has traelled since, tlere might have been more instructive,

And Jos owned with a sigh, '`that for good streaky beef, really minglel
with fnt and lcun, there was no country like England.''
Except Irclaud, whcre all your best mate comes from,'' said the
MInjor's lady; proceeding, ns is not unusunl with patriots of her nation,
to make compnrisons greatly in favour of er own country. The iden of
comparing the market nt bruges with those of bDulin, although she had
suggested it herself, caused immense scorn and derision on her pnrt.
I 'Il thank ye to tell me what they menn by thnt old gzabo on thc

brought the old tower down. The place was full of English soldiery as

and no enemy in front. WYhen our truavellers arrived at Brussels, in whicl
thcir regiment was quartered, n grent piece of good fortune, as all said,
they found themselves in one of the gayest nd most brilliant liltle capitals
in lEurope, and were all the Vnnity Fair bootls were laid out with the
most tempting liveliness and splendour. ambling was here in profusion,
and dnncing in plenty : feasting was there to fill with dclight tlat great
gourmand of a Jos: there was n theatre where a miraculous Catalani was
delighting all heurers; beautiful rides, all elivened with martial splendour;
a rare old city, with strange costumes anud wonderful architecture, to
delight the eyes of littlc Amelia, who had never bofore sccn a forcign
country, and fill her with chrming surprises: so thut now and for n few
weeks' space, in a fine handsomc lodging, whereof the expenses were borne
by Jos and Osborue, wlo wss flush of money aud full of kind attentions to
his wife-for about a fortniglt I sy, duriug which her loneymoon ended,
MIrs. Amelia was as plecased an happy as any little bride out of England.
Eery day during this happy time there was novelty and amusement
for all parties. There wns u church to see, or a picture gallery-there
wras n ride, or an opera. The bands of the regimeunts were aking music
at all hours. IThe greatest folkse of England wnlked in the lark-tlere
as a perpetual military festial. George taking out his wife to a new
jaunt or junket every night, was quite plesed witl limself us usual, and
swore he was becoming quite a doestic character. And ajaunt or ajuuket

letters home to her mother were filled with delight and gratitude at this
season. Her husband bade ler buy laces, millinery, jewels, and gimcracks
of nll sorts. Oh, he was the kindest, best, and most geuerous of enl
The sight of the very great company of lords and ladies and fashionable
persons who throngel the town and appeared in every public place, filled
George's truly British soul with intense delight. `They flung off that
happy frigidity and inseolence of demeanour which oecasionally characterises
the great at home, and appearing in numberless public places, condescenlel
to mingle with the rest of the company whom they met there. One night
nt a party given by the general of the division to which George's regient
helonged, he ad the lonour of dancing with Lady Blanche Thistlewood,
Lord Bareacres' daughtecr; he bustled for iccs and refrcshments for the
two noble laies; he pushel and squeezed for Lady areacres' carriage;
he bragged about the Countess when he got home, in a way wlich his
own father could not have surpassed. IIe called upon tle ladies the next
dy; he rode by their side in the Park; he nsked their parly to a great
linner nt a restaurateur's, and was quite wild with cxultution when they
ngreed to come. Old Bareacres, who hal uot mueh pride and a large
appetite, would go for a dinner anywhere.
I hope there will be no women besides our own party,'' Laly Bare-
acres suid, after reflecting upon the invitation which lad een made, and
accepted with too much precipitancy.
``Gracius Heaven, Mamma-you don't suppose the man would bring
his wife,'' shrieked Lady Blancho, who had beceun languishing in George's
arms in the newly-imported waltz for hours the night before. Tha
`' mcn are bearable, but their women-''

VANITY FAIR.
 Wife, just married, des'lish pretty womnan, I henr,'' the old Enrl
said.
 Well, my dear Blanche,'' said the mother, ``I suppose ns Papa wants
to go, we must go: but we needn't know them in ngland, you know.''
And so, determined to cut their new nequaintance in Bond Street, these
great folks went to eat his dinner nat Brussels, nnd condesrending to
nake him pay for their pleasurc, showed their dignity by making his
wife uncomfortable, and cnrefully exeluding her from the conersation.
This is a species of dignity in whieh the high-bred ritish female
reigns supreme. To watch the behaviour of a fine lady to other and
humbler women is a very good sport for a philosophical frequenter of
Vanity Fir.
This festival, on which honest George spent a great deal of money, was
the very dismallest of all the entertainments which Amelia had in hcr
honey-moon. Bhe wrote the most piteous accounts of the fenst home to
her mamma: how the Countess of Bareacres would not answer when
spoken to; how Lady Blanche stared at her with her eye-glass; and
what a rage Captain Dobbin wss in at thleir behaviour; and how my
lord as they came away from the feast, asked to see the bill, and pro-
nounced it a d- bad dinner, and d- denr. But though Amelia told all
these stories, and wrote home regarding her guests' rudeness, and her own
discomfiture; old Mrs. Sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless, and
talked about Emmy's friend, the Countess of Bareacres, with such assi-
luity that the news how his son was entertaiuing Peers and Peeresses
actually came to Osborne's ears in the City.
Those who know the present Lieutennt-Geueral Sir George Tufto,
K.C.B., and have seen him, as they may on most days in the season,
padded and in stays, strutting down Pall-Mall with a ricketty swagger on
his high-heeled lacquered boots, leering under the bonuets of pnsscrs by,
pr riding n showy chestnut, and ogling Broughams in thce Parks-those
wlhio know the present Sir George Tufto would hnrdly recognise the
ring Peninsula and Waterloo officer. He has thiek curling brown hair
and black eyebrows now, and his whiskers are of the deepest purple. He
was light-haired and bald in 18l5, and stouter in the person and in the
limbs, which especially have shrunk very much of late. When he was
about seventy years of age (he is now nenrly eighty), his hair, which was
very scarce and quite white, suddeuly grew thick, and brown, and curly,
and his whiskers and eyebrows took their present colour. Ill-natured
people say that his chest is all wool, and that his hair, beecause it neer gros,
isa wig. Tom Tufto, with whose father he quarrelled ever so many years
ago, declares that Mademoiselle de Jaisey, of the French theatre, pulled his
grandpaspa's hair off in the green-room; but Tom is notoriously spiteful
and jealous; and the General's wig has nothing to do with our story.
One day, as some of our friends of the -th were sauntering in the
flower-market of Brussels, having been to see the Hotel de Ville, which
Mrs. Major O'Dowd declared was not near so large or handsome as her
fawther's mansion of Glenmalony, an offieer of rank with an orderly behinl
him, rode up to the market, and descending from his horse, came amongst
the flowers, and selected the vcry finest bouquet which money could uy.

The beutiful bundle being tiel up in a paper, the officer remounted, giving
the nosegay into the charge of his military groom, who carried it withn
grin, following his chief who rode away in great state and self-satis-
faction.
 You should see the flowers at Glenmalony,'' Mrs. O'Dowd was remark-
ing. ' Mce fasther has three Scotch garners with niue helpers. We lve

conscience I think our magnolias is as big as taykettles,''
Dobbin, who never uscd to `draw out' Mrs. O'Dowd as tlat wicked
Osborne lelighted in doiug, (much to Amelia's terror, who implored him
to spare her,) fell back in the crowd, crowing and sputtering until he
reached a safe distance, when he exploded amongst the astonished market-
people with shrieks of yclling laughter.

Amelia's heart fell,-she knew not why. The sun did not seem to
shine so bright. The tall oll roofs and gables looked less picturesque all
of a sudden, though it wns a brilliant sunset, aud one of the brightest and
most beautiful days at the end of May.

lis open carriage, with which cattle,
and the smart London vehicle, he
made a very tolerable figure in the
dries about Brussels. George
purchased a horse for his nrivate
riding, and he and Captnin Dobbin
would often accompany the carriage
in which Jos and his sister took
dnily excursions of pleasure. They
went out that day in the park for
tleir accustomed diversion, and
there, sure enough, George's re-
mark with regnrd to the arrival of
Rnwdon Crawley and his wife
proved to be correct. In the midst
of a little troop of horsemen, con-
sisting of some of the very greatcst persons in Brussels, Rebececea was seeu
in the prettiest and tightest of riding-habits, mounted on a beautiful little
Arab, which she role to perfection (haing aequired the art at ueen's
Crawley, where the Baronet, Mr. Pitt, and Rawdon himself had given her
many lessons), and by the side of the gallant General Tufto.
Suro, it's the Juke himself,'' cried MIrs. Major O'Dowd to Jos, who
began to blush violently; ``and that 's Lord Uxbridge on the bay. How
clegant he looksl Me brotler, Molloy Moloney, is as like him ns two peas.''
llebecca did not make for the crriage; but as soon as she perceied
her old acquaintance Amclia seated in it, acknowlcdged her presence by a
gracious word and smile, and by kissing and shaking her fiugers playfully
in the direction of the veliecle. Thecn she resumed her conversation with
Gencral Tufto, who asked ``who the fat officer was in the gold-laced cap?''
on hieh Becky replicl, `'that he was an oficer in the East Indian ser-
vice.'' But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of his company, and
came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said to Jos,  WVll,
old boy, how are you?'' and stared in Mrs. O'Dowd's face ant black coek's
feathers until she begnn to think she ad made a conquest of him.
Gcorge, who had been delayed hehind, rode up almost immediately
with Dolbin, and they touched thcir caps to the august pcersonages, among
whom Osborne at once perceivred Mrs. Crawley. He wns delightel to see

warmth. The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest
specimens of politeness.
Crawley told George where they were stopping with General Tufto at
the HIotel du Parc, and George made his friend promise to come specdily
to Oslorue's own resilence. ``Sorry I hadn't seen you three days ago,''
George said. ` IHIul a diuner at the Restauruteur's-rathcr a nice thing.
Lord Bareacres, and the Countess, and Lady Blanche, were gool cuough
to dine with us-wish we'd had you.'' Having thus let his frienud know
his claims to be a man of fshion, Osborne parted from llawdon, who
followed the august squadron down an allcy into which thucy cantered,
while George and Dobbin resumed their places, one on cach side of
Anelia's cnrriage.

The apparition of the great personagss held them all in talk during the
drive; and at dinner; and until the hous acnme when they were all to go
to the Opera.
It was almost like Old England. The house was filled wvith fnmiliar
DBritish faces, and those toilettes for which the Britisl female has long
been celebrated. Mrs. O'bDowd's was not the least splendid amongst
these, and shc had a curl on her forehead, and a set of Irish diamonds and
Cairngorms, wlich oulshone all the decortions in the housc, in cr
nolion. IIer prescnce used to excruciate Osborne; but go she would
upon all parties of pleasure on which she heard hcr young friends were
bent. It never entered into her thought but thnt tley must be clared
with her company.

he coull lcave nlone with less scruple when she had this society. :Bnut
what a comfort it is thnt Recbecca's comc: you will hue her for a friend,
and we may get ril now of this dmn'd Irishwoman.'' To tlis Amelia
did not answer, yes or no: and how do we know what her thoughts
ere?

Freuch music at all equal in her opinion to the mcelodies of hcr native

Near the pretty little woman in white?'' nsked a middle-aged gen-
tleman seated by the querist'as side, with orders in his button, aud several
under-waistcoats, and a great, choky, white stock.
 That pretty woman in white is Amelia, General: you are remarking
all the pretty women, you naughty man.''
 Only one, begad, in the warldI'' said the General, delighted, and the
lady gave him a tap withl a large bouquet which sle had.
Bedasd it's him,'' said Mrs. O'Dowd; `` and that's the very bokay he
bought in the Marshy aux FluresI'' and when Rebecea, having caught
her friend's eye, performed the little hand-kissing operation once more,
Mrs. Mijor O'D., taking the compliment to herself, returned the slute
with a grucious smile, which sent that unfortunate Dobbin shrieking ut
of the box asgain.
At tle end of the act, George was out of the box in a moment, and he
was evcn going to pay his respects to lebecca in her loge. He met
Crawley in the lobby, however, where they exchanged a few sentences
upon the oceurrences of the last fortnight.

young gentlemen of fushion, who were, like himself, on the staff of a
general officer.
George was only half pleased to be asked to dinner on that particular
lay when the General was aotf to dine. 'I will go in and pay my respects
to your wife,'' said hc; at which Rawlon snid, ` Hm, ns you please,''
looking very glum, and at which the to young officers exchnged know-
ing glances. George parted from them, and strutted down the lobby ta
the General's box, the number of which he had carefully countel.
Enlree,'' said a clear little voice, and our friend found himself in
Rebecca's presence; who jumped up, clapped her hands together, and held
out both of them to George, so charmed ws she to see him. The
General, with the orders in his button, stared at the new comer with n
sulky scowl, as much as to say, who the devil are you'

We benr the same arms,'' George said, as indeel was the fact; Mr.
Osorne having consulted with a herald in Long Acre, and picked the L-
arms out of the peerage, when he set up his carriage fifteen years before.
The General made no reply to this announcement; but took up his opera-
glass-the double-barrelled lorgnon was not invented in those days-and
pretenled to examine the house; but Rebecca saw that his disengaged
eye was working round in her direction, and shooting out blood-shot
glances at her and George.
She redoubled in cordiality.  IIow is dearest AmeliaP ut I needn't

` Shall lI go and feteh you some '' said the General, bursting with
wrath.
`` Let me go, I entreat you,'' George said.
 No, I will go to Amelin's box. Dear, sweet girll Give me your arm,
Cnptain George;'' nnd so saying, and with a nod to the General, she
tripped into the lobby. She gae George the queerest, knowingest look,
when they were together, a look which might have been interpreted,
Don't you see the state of alfairs, and what a fool I 'm makiug of him?''
But he did not perceive it. lIc was thinking of his own plans, and lost
in pompous admirution of his own irresistible powers of plesing.
The curses to which the General gave a low ulterance, as soon as
Rebecca and her conqueror hal quitted him, were so decp, that I am sure
no compositor in Mlessrs. I3ralbury and Evans's establislment would
venture to print them wcre they written down. They came from the
General's henrt ; anl a wonderful thing it is to think that the human henrt
is capable of generating such nroduce, and can throw out, as oecasion
demands, sucl a supply of lust and fury, rage and hatrel.
Amelia's gentle cyes, too, had bcen fixcd anxiously on tho pair, whose
conduct hal so chalel the jealous General ; but when lebecca entered her
box, she flew to her friend with an auffectionate rapture which showed itself,
in spite of the publicity of the place; for she embraced her denrest friend
in the prescnce of the wlole louse, at lcast i full view of the General's
glass, now brought to bear upon the Osborne party. Mrs. Rawdon
salutel Jos, too, with the kiuliest greeting: she admired Mrs. O'Dowl's
large Cairugorm brooch nnd superb Irish diamonds, and wouldn't believe
thnt they were not from Golcondu direct. She bustled, she chttered, shce
turned and twisted, and smiled upon one, and smirked on another, all in
full yiew of the jealous opera-glass opposite. And when the time for the
ballet cnme (in which there was no duncer that went through her grimaees
or performed her comedy of action better), she skipped back to her ow
box, leaning on Cuptaiun obbin's arm this time. No, shce would not have

beyond this neither of the llies rallied. Amelia was overnowered by tle
flush and the azzle and the fushionable tulk of her worldly rival. Even

the O'Dowd was silent anl subdued after Becky's brilliant apparition,
nnd scarcely said a word more about Glenmalony all the evening.
Wen do yon intend to give up play, George, as you have promised me
any time these hundred yenrs'' Dobbin said to his friend a few days after
the night nt the Opera. `When doyou intend to give up seroising ''

Witli fair play it comcs to pretty much the same thing at the year's end.''
`ut I don't think he could pay if he lost,'' Dobbin said; and his
advice met with the success which uadvice usunlly commands. Osborne
annd Craley were repentedly together now. Generul Tufto dined abroal
nlmost constantly. Gieorge was always welcome in the apartments (very
elose inleed to those of the General), which the Aide-de-camp and his
wife occupied in the hotel.
Amelia's manners were sueh when she annd George visited Crawley and
his wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first
quarrel ; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident unwil-
lingness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which sle comportcdl
herself townrds Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did not sy one
single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon hcr, and llcbeccn
seanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashul and awkward on
the second visit which she paid to Mrs. Rawdon, than on her first call.
Rebeecca was doubly nffectionate, of course, and would not tuke notice,
in the least, of her friend's coolness.  I think Emmy has become prouder
since her fnther's name was in the -, since Mr. Seilley's is/ortanes,''
ebecca said, softening the phrase charitably for George's enr.
`Upon my word, I thought when we were nt Brighton she was doing
me the honour to be jeulous of me; and now I suppose she is seandnlisetl
because awdon, and I, and the General live together. Why, my denr
creature, how could we, with our menns, live at all, but for a friend to
shnre expenses And do you suppose that lawdon is not big enough to
take care of my honour i But I 'm very much obliged to Eny, very,''
MIrs. Rawdon, said.
 Pooh, jecalousy!'' answered George, ``all women are jealous.''
`'And all men too. Weren't you jealous of General Tufto, and the
General of you, on the night of the Operae Why, he was ready to eat
me for going with you to visit thmat foolish little wife of your's; as if I
care a pin for cither of you,'' Crawley's wife said, with a pert toss of her
henl.  Wll you diue here he dragon dines with the Commander-
in-Chief. Greuat news is stirring. Tley say the French have crossed tle
firontier. We sball have a quiet dinuer.''
George accepted thc invitation, although his wife was n little ailing.
They were now not quite six weeks marricd. Aolher woman ws luugh-
ing or sneering at her exspense, and he not angry. IIe was not even
ngry with himself, this good-natured fellow. It is a shame, he owned to
himself; but hang it, if a prctty woman il throw herself into your wuy,

he hnd often sid, smiling and nolding knowingly to Stubble and Spooney,
nnd other conrades of the mess-table; and they rather respected him thn
otherwise for this prowess. Next to conquering in war, conquering in
love has been a source of pride, time out of mind, amongst men in Vanity
Fair, or how should school-boys brag of their amours, or Don Juan be
popular?
So Mr. Osborne, hnving a firm conviction in his own mind that he
wns a woman-killer and destined to conquer, did not run counter to his
fute, but yieldedl himself up to it quite complacently. And as Emmy did
not say much or plague him with her jealousy, but merely became un-
happy and pined over it miserably in secret, he chose to fancy that she
was not suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly aware-
namely, that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with Mrs. Crawley.
IIe rode withi her whenever she was free. He pretended regimental busi-
ness to Mmelia, (y which falsehood she was not in the least deceived)
and consigning his wife to solitude or her brother's society, passed his
evenings in the Crawley's compnny; losing money to the husband nnd
flattering himself that the wife was dying in love for him. It is very
likely that this worthy couple never nbsolutely conspiret, and agreed
together in so many words: the one to cujole thc young gentleman,
whilst thc other won his money at cards: but they understood each other
perfcctly well, and Hawdon let Osborue come and go with entire good
humour.
George wans so oecupied with his new acquaiutances that he and
Willinm lDobbin were by no means so much together as formerly. Georga
avoided him in public and in the regiment, and, as we see, did not like
those sermons which his senior was lisposed to inflict upon him. If
some parts of his conduct made Captain Dobbin exceedingly grave and
cool; of what use was it to tell eorge that thougl his whiskcrs were
large, nnd his own opiuion of lis knowingness great, hc was as green as
a schoolloy? that Rawdon was making a victim of him as he had done
of many before, and as soon as he had used him would fling him off with
scorn He would not listen: and so, as Dolbin upon those days when
he visited the Osborne house, seldom had the advantage of meeting his
old friend, much painful and unavailing talk between them was spared.
Our friend George ws in the full career of the pleasures of Vanity Fair.
There never was, since tle dnys of Darius, such a brilliant train of camp-
followers s hung round the train of the Duke of Wellington's army in
the Low Countries, in 1815; and lcd it dancing and feasting, as it were,
up to the very brink of battle. A certain ball which a noble Duchess gave
nt Brusscls on the 15th of June in the above-named yeur is listorical. All
Brussels had been in a state of excitement nbout it, and I have heard
from ladies who were in that town at the period, that the talk und interest
of persons of their own sex regarding the bnll wns much greuter even
than in respect of the enemy in thcir front. The struggles, intrigues, and
pryers to get tickets were such as only English ladies will employ, in
order to gain admission to tle society of tle great of their own ntion.
A NOVEI. WITHOUT A IHELR0.
263
Jos aul Mrs. O'Dond, who were panting to be aske, stroe in vsin to
procure tickets; but others of our friends were more lucky. For instance,
through the interest of my Lord Bareacres, nnd as a set-off for the dinner
at the restaurateur's, George got a card for Captain and Mrs. Osborne;
which circumstance greatly elated him. Dobbin, wlo was a friend of the
General commanding the division in which their regimcnt was, cme
laughing one day to Mrs. Osborue, and displayed a similar invitation,
which madc Jos envious, and George wonder how the deuce le should be
getting into society. Mr. and Mrs. Rawdon, finally, were of course
invited; as becamc the friends of a General commanding a cavalry
brigade.
On the appointed night, George, having commandel new dresses and
ornaments of all sorts for Amelia, drove to the famous ball, where his
wife did not know a single soul. After looking about for Lady Bareacres,
who cut him, thinking the card was quite enough-and after placing
Amelia on a beneb, he left her to her own cogitations thcre, tlinking, on
his own pnrt, that he had belaved very handsomely in getting her new
clothes, and bringing her to the bull, where she was free to amuse herself
as she liked. Her thoughts were not of the pleasantest, and nobody
exeept honest Dobbin came to disturb them.
Whilst her appearance was an utter failure (as her husband felt with a sort
of rage), Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's deut was, on the eontrary, very brilliant.
She arrived very late. Her face was radiant ; her dress perfection, in the
midst of the great persons assembled, and thce eye-glasses directed to her,
Rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected as when she used to marshal
Mias Pinkerton's little girls to church. Numbers of the men sle knew
already, and the dundies thronged round her. As for the laies, it was
whispered among them that Rnwdon had run away with her from out of
a convent, and that she was a relation of the Montmorency family. Shc
spoke French so perfectly that there might be some truth in this report,
and it was agreed that her manners were fine, and hcr air distingue. Fifty
would-be partners thronged round her at once, and pressed to have the
honour to dance with her. But she said she was engaged, and only going
to dance very little; and made hcr way at once to the place where Emmy
sate quite unnoticed, and dismnlly unhappy. And so, to finish the poor
child at once, Mrs. Rawdon ran and greeted affiectionately her dearest
hmelia, and begn fortlwith to patronisc her. She found fault with her
friend's dress, and her hair-dresser, nnd wondered how she could e so
chaussee, and vowed that she must send her corsetiere the uext morning.
She vowed that it was a deligltful ball; that thcre was everyboly that
every one knew, and only a ery few nobodies in the wlole room. It is a
faet, that in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this
young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a natie could
not speak it better; and it was only from her French being so good, that
you could know sho was not a born wonan of faslion.
George, who had left Emmy on her bench on entering the ball-room,
very soon found lis way back when Rebecca was by her dear friend's side.
Becky was just lecturing Mrs,. Osborne upon the follies whicl her husband
was committing.  For God's sake, stop him from gabling, my dcar,''

se snid, ``or he will ruin hinself. He and llawdon are plsying at oards

shilling from him if he does not tke care. Why don't you prevent him,
you little careless creature WVhy don't you seme to us of an evening,
instend of moping at home with that Captain Dobbin? I dure say he is

husband's feet are durlings- Here he comes. Where hae you been,
wrretchP Here is Emmy crying her eyes out for you. Are you coming to
feteh me for the quadrille%'' Mnd she left her bouquet and shawl by
Amelia's side, and tripped off with George to dance. Women only know
how to wound so. There is a poison on the tips of their little shafts, which
stings a thousand times more than a nan's blunter weapon. Our poor
Emm, who had never hated, never sneered all her life, was powerless in
the hands of ler remorseless little enemy.
George danced with Rebeecca twice or thrice-low many times Amelig
scarcely knew. She sate quite unnoticed in her corner, except when
Rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversntion: and later in
the evening, when Cnptain Dobbin made so bold as to bring her refresh-
monts and sit beside her. He did not like to ask her why she was so sad;
but ns a pretext for the tcars which were filling in her eyes, she told him
that Mrs. Cruwley had alarmel ler by telling her that George would go on
plsying.
It is eurious, when a man is bent upon play, by what clumsy rogues
he will allow himself to be cheasted,'' Dobbin snid; and Emmy snid,
`Indeed.'' She was thinking of something else. It was ot the loss of
the money that grievel her.
At last George came baek for Rebccea's shal and flowers. She was
going away. She did not even conlescend to come ck and say good
bye to Amelia. The poor girl let her husbund come and go without saying
an word, and her hend fell on her breasst. Dobbin hnd been cnllel away,
nnd was whispering deep in conversation with the general of the division,
his friend, and had not seen this last parting. George went away then
with the bouquet; but when he gave it to the owner, there lay a note, coiled
like  snake among the flowers. Rebeeca's eye caught it at once. She
had been usel to deal with notes in early life. She put out her hand and
took the nosegay. He saw by her eyes as they et, that she was aware
what sh should fiud there. Her husband hurried her away, still too
intent upon his own thoughts, seemingly, to take note of any marks of
recognition which might pass between his friend and his wife. These
were, however, but trifling. ebeeca gave George her hand with one of
her usunl quick knowing glances, and made a curtsey and walked away.
George bowed over the hand, snid nothing in reply to a remark of Crawley's,
did not hear it even, his brain was so throbbing with triumph and excite-
ment, and allowed them to go awny without a word.
His wife saw the one part at lenst of the bouquet-secne. It was quite
atural that George should come at Rebecca's request to get hcr her searf
nnd flovers: it was no more tha hc had done twenty times before in the
course of the last few days; but now it was too much for her,  W1.

stern old man had done him.
He had looked into Amelia's bed-room when he entered ; she lay quiet,
and her eyes seemed closed, and he was glnd that she was asleep. On
arriving at his quarters from the ball, he had found his regimental servant
nlready making preparations for his departure: the man had understood
lis signal to be still, and these arrangements were very quickly and
silently made. Should he go in and wake Amelia, he thought, or leave a

She had een awake when he first entered her room, but had kept her

heart had felt more at ease, and turning towards him as he stept softly
out of the room, she had fallen into a light sleep. George eame in and

combatants. When the decks are cleared
for action we go below and wait meekly,
We should only be in the way of the
manaeuvres that the gallant fellows are
performing over head. We shall go no
farther with the-th than to the city gate:
and lenving Major O'Dowd to his duty,
come back to the Major's wife, and the
ladies and the baggage.
Now, the Maior and his lady, who had
not been inited to the ball at which in our
lnst chapter other of onr friends figurel,
had much more time to take thcir whole-
some natural rest in bed, thnn was acetcorded
to pcople who wishcd to cnjoy pleasure as
well as to do duty. `` It's my belief, IPeggy, my der,'' said he, as he pla-
cidly pulled his night-cap over his cars, ``that there vill be such a ball
danceed in a day or two ais some of 'em has never heard the chune ofg''
and he was much more happy to retire to rest nfter partaking of a quiet
tumbler, than to figure at any other sort of nmusement. Peggy, for her
part, would have liked to haie shon her turban nd bird of paralise at
the ball, but for the information wlich her husbant had given hcr, and
which made her very grave.
eI'd like ye wake me about half an hour before the assembly beats,''
the Msior said to his ldr:  Cll me ot half-pst oc gs, ser, s
see me things isready. May be I'll not come back to breakfast, Mrs. O'D,''
Wth which words, which signifiel his opinion that the regiment would
march the next morning, the Mnjor ceased talking, and fell sleep.
Mrs. O'Dowd, the good housewife, arrayel in curl-papers anl a camisole,
felt that her duty was to act, and not to sleep, at this juncture. : Time
enugh for that,'' she said,'' when Mick's gone;'' and so she packe his tra-
velling-valise ready for the march, brushed his clonk, his can, nnd other
warlike habiliments, set them out in orler for him; and stowed away in the
eloak-poekets a light package of portable refreshments, nd a wicker-
coered flask or pocket-pistol, containing near a pint of a remarkably

sound Coguac brandy, of which she and thc Maojor approrel ery mucl,
and as soon as the hands of the ``repaythcr'' pointed to half-past one,
nnd its interior arrangements (it had a tone quite aqual to a cathaydral,
its fair owner considered) knelled forth that fatal hour, Mrs. O'Dowd woke
up her Major, and had as comfortable a cup of eoffee prepared for lim as
nny made that morning in Brussels. And who is there will deny that
this worty laly's preparations betokenel affection as much as tle fits
of tears and hysterics by which more sensitie females exshibited their
love, and that their partaking of this coffee, which they drank together
while the bugles were sounding the turn-out and the drums beating in the
varionus quartecrs of the town, was not more useful and to the purpose than
the outpouring of any mere sentiment could be? The consequence was,
that the MIajor appeared on parade quite trim, fresh, and alert, his well-
shnved rosy countecnanee, as he sate on horseback, giving cheerfulness and
confidence to tle whole corps. All the officers suluted her when tle
regiment marched by the balcony on which this brave woman stood, and
wauvcd them a cheer as they passed; and I daresay it was not from want
of courage, but from a sense of feale delicacy and propriety, that she
refrainel from leading the gallant -th personally into action.
On Sundays, and at periods of a solemn nature, Mrs. O'Dowd used to
real with grent graity out of a large volume of her uncle the Dean's ser-
mons. It d bcen of great comfort to her on board the transport as
they were coming home, and were very nearly wrecked on their rcturn
from the West Indics. After the regimeut's departure she betook herself
to this volume for meditation; perhaps she did not unlerstand much of
what she was readiug, and her thoughts were clsewhere: but the sleep
projeet, with poor Mick's nightcap there on the pillow, was quite a vain
one. So it is in the world. Jack or Donald marches away to glory with
his napsack on his shoulder, stepping out briskly to the tune of ``The
Girl I left behind me.'' It is she who remains and suffers,-and has
the leisure to think, and brood, and remember.
Knowing how useless regrets are, aud how the indulgenee of sentiment
only serves to nke pcople more miserable, Mrs. Rcbecca wisely deter-
mined to give way to uo vain feelings of sorrow, and bore the partiug
from her husband with quite a Spartan equaniity. Indeet Captain
Rawdon himsclf was uch more affected at the leave-taking than the
resolute little woman to whom he bade farewell. She had mnstered this
rude coarse nature; and he loved and worshipped her with all lis faculties
of regard nnd admiration. In nll his life hoe had never been so happy, as.
during the past few months, his wife hand made lim. All former delights
of turf, mess, hunting-field, nnd gabliug-table; all previous loves and
courtslips of milliners, opera-dancers, and the like easy triumphs of thc
clusy military Adonis, were quite insipid when conpared to the lawful
matrimonial pleasures wlich of late he had enjoyed. Sho had known
pcretually how to divert him; and ho had found his house and her
society a thousand times more pleasant than any place or company which

anll, which must remain for ever as obstaeles to prevent his wife's advnce-
ent in the world. He had often groned over these in iduight con-
vcrsations with Rebecca, althougl as a bnchelor they had never given him
any disquiet. He himself was struck with this pheuomenon. `` Hung it,''
he would say (or perhaps use a still stronger cxpression out of his simple
vocabulary) ` before I was marricd I lidn't care what bills I put my name
to, nnd so long as MIoses would wnit or Levy would renew for three
montls, I kept on uever minding. But siuce I'm married, except renew-
iug of course, 1 gie you uy honour I've not touched a bit of staped

Rebecca always knew how to conjure away thesc moods of melancholy.

nunt yet. If she fails us, isn't there what you cnll thle Guzettc? or, stop,

Rebecca by a hundred caresscs and kind words tricd to soothe the feel-
ings of the wounded lover. It was only when her vivacity and sense of
humour got the better of this sprightly creature (as they would do uder
most circumstances of life indeed,) that she would break out with her
satire, but she could soon put on a demure face. `' Dearest love,'' she
said, `` do you suppose I feel nothing ?'' and, lastily lashing sometling

the dealers have so many bills of mine, and so I'd rather he shouldn 't go
back to England. our little marc the General gave you will feteh some-
thing, nnd there 's no d-d livery stable bills here as there are in London,''
Rawdon added, with a laugh.  Thcere's that dressing-case cost me two
hundred,-that is, Iowe two for it; and the gold tops and bottles must be
worth thirty or forty. Please to put tlat up the spout, ma'am, with my
pins, and rings, and watch and chain, and things. Tey cost a precious
lot of money. Miss Crawley, I know, paid a hundrel down for the chain
and ticker. Gold tops and ottles, indeedl dummy, I m sorry I diln't
take more now. Edwards presscd on me a silver-gilt boot-jack, and I
might hnve had a dressing-case fitted up with a silver wrming-pau, and a
service of plate. But we must uke the best of what we 'se got, Becky,
you know.''
And so, making his last dispositions, Captain Crawley, who lad seldom
thought about auything but limsclf, until the lsst few months of his life,
when Love had obtained the mastery ovcr the dragoon, vent through the
various items of his little catalogue of efects, striving to sce how they
might be turned into money for his wife's benefit, in case any accident
should befal him. He pleased himself by noting down with a pencil, in
his big school-boy handwriting, the various items of his portable property
which might be sold for his widow's advantage-as for example, " M
louble-barril by Manton, say 40 guineas; my driving cloak, lined with
sable fur, E50; my duelling pistols in rosewood case, (sme which I shot
Captain Mrker), A20 ; my regulation saddle-holsters and housings; my
Laurie ditto,'' uand so forth, over all of hich articles he made Hebecca the
istress.
Faithful to his plan of economy, the Captain dressel himself in his
oldest and shabbiest uniform and epaulets, leaving the newest behind,
under his wife's (or it might be his widow's) guardiauship. And this
famous dandy of Winlsor and Hyle Park went off on his campaign with
a kit as modest as that of a serjeant, and with something like a prayer on
his lips for the woman he was lcaving. He took her up from the ground,
nnd held her in his arms for a minute, tight pressed against his strong-
beating heart. IIis face was purple and his eyes dim, as he put hcr down
and left her. IIoe rode by his General's side, and smoked his cigar in
silence as they hastenel after the troops of the General's brigale, whiceh
preceded the; and it wns not ntil they were some miles on their way
tht he left off twirling his moustache and broke silence.
And Rebeccn, as we have said, wisely determined not to give wny to
unavailing sentimentality on her husband's departure. She wuved him an
adieu from the window, and stood there for a moment looking out after
he was gone. The cathedral towers and the full gables of the quaint old
houses were just beginning to blush in the sunrise. There had been no
rest for her that night. She was still in her pretty ball-dress, her fair
hair hanging somewhat out of curl on her neck, and the circles round her
eyes dark with watching. ee What a fright I seem,'' she said, examining
herself in the glass, ``and how pale this pink makes one look.I'' So she

The town was quite quiet when she woke up at ten o'clock, and partook
of cofee, very requisite and comfortable after the exhaustion and grief of
the morning's occurrences.
This meal over, she resumed honest Rawlon's caleulations of the night
previous, nnd surveyed hcr position. Should the worst befal, all things
considered, she was pretty well to do. There were her own trinkets and
trousseau, in aldition to those whicl ler husand had let behind. aw-
lon's generosity, when they were first married, has already been described
and lauded. Besides thcse, and the little mare, the General, her slave and
worshipper, had ade her rny very handsome resents in the shape of
cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a bankrupt French general's lady,
and numerous tributcs from the jewvellers' shops, all of which betokenel her
almirer's taste and wenlth. As for ``tickers,'' as poor Rlawdon called watches,
her apartments were alive with their clicking. lor, appening to mention
one uight that ers, whicl Rawdon had given to her, was of English work-
manship, and went ill, on the very next moruing there came to her a little
bijou markel Leroy, with a chain and cover charmingly sct with turquoises,
and another signed Breguet, which was covered with pearls, nnd yet
scnreely bigger than a half-cron. General Tufto had bought oue, nnd
Captain Osborne had gnllantly pcesentel the other. Mrs. Osborne had
no watch, though, to lo George justice, she might huve had one for the
nsking, anl thce Honourable Mrs. Tufto in England had an old instrument
of her mother's that might have served for the plate warming-pan which
Rawdon talked about. If Messrs. Howell and James were to publish a
list of the purchasers of all the trinkets wlich they sell, how surprised
would some filies be; and if all these ornaments went to gentlemen's
lawful wives and daughters, what a profusion of jcwellery there would be

without a pungent feeling of triumph and self-satisfaction, that should cir-
cumstances occur, she might reckon on six or seven humndred ponnds nt tlc
very least, to begin thc world with: andl she passed the morning disposing,
ordering, looking ont, nnd locking up ber properties in the most agreenble
manner. Among the notes in Hawaon's pocket-book, wns a draft for
twenty pounds on Osborne's banker. This male her think about MIrs.
Osborne. `I will go and get the draft cashed,'' she said, ``and pay a
visit afterwards to poor little Lmmy.'' If this is a novel without a hero,
nt least let us lay claim to a heroine. No man in the bBritish army which
has marched away, not the great duke himself, could be more cool or col-
lected in the presence of doubts and difficulties, than the indomitable little
nide-de-camp's wife.
Mnd there was another of our acquaintances who was also to be Ioft
behind, a non-combatant, and whose emotions nnd belaviour we havse
thereforo a right to know. This wns our friend the ex-collector of
Boggleywollah, whose rest wns broken, like other pcople's, by the sound-
ing of the bugles in the early morning. Being a great sleeper, and fond
of his bed, it is possible he would have snoozed on until his usual hour of
rising in tho forenoon, in spite of all the drums, bugles, and bagpipes in
the British nrmy, but for an interruption, which did not come from George
Osborne, who shared Jos's quarters with him, and was as usual occupied
too much with his own affairs, or with grief at parting with his wvife, to
tlink of taking leave of his slumhering brother-in-law-it was not George,
wc sny, who interposed between Jos Sedley and sleep, but Captain Dobbin,
who came and roused lim up, insisting on shaking hands with him before
his departure.
 Very kind of you,'' said Jos, yawning, and wishing the Capain at
tle deuce.
I-I didn't like to go off without sying good-bye, you know,'' Dob-
bin said in a very incoherent manner; `` because you know some of us
mayn't come back again, and I like to see you all well and-aud that sort
of thing, you know.''
 What do you men ?'' Jos asked, rubbing his eyes. The Captain lid
not in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the night-eap,
about whom he professed to have such a tenler interest. Tle lypocrite
was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of George's
npartments, striding about the room, upsetting the chnirs, beating the
tattoo, biting his nails, and showing other signs of great inward emotion.
Jos had always had rather a mean opinion of thc Cptain, and now
begn to think his courage was somewlat equirocnl.  What is it I can
lo for you, Dobbin%'' he snid in a sarcastic tone.
I tell you what you can do,'' the Captain replied, coming up to the
bed; `` we march in n quarter of an hour, Sedley, and neither George nor

and you will promise me on your word tlat you will never desert her. I

 ou spcak like a man of spirit, Jos,'' the other answered good-
naturedly, `` and I am glad that Gdeorge cn leave her in such good hands.
So I may gie him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity
you will stand by her'
Of course, of coursc,'' nnswered MIr. Jos, whose generosity in roney
matters Dobbin cstimated quite correctly.
'And you'll see her safe out of Hrussels in the event of a defeat?'
`:`A defeatl D- it, Sir, it's impossible. Don't try and frighten ne,'' thc
hero eried from his bed; and Dobbin's mind was thus perfectly set at easc
now that Jos had spoken out so resolutely respecting his conduct to his
sister. ``At least,'' thought the Captain, ``tlere will be a retreat scenred
for her in case the worst should ensue.''
If Cnptain Dobbin expected to get any personal comfort anl satisface-
tion from having one more view of Amnelin before the regiment marcheld away,
his sclfishess was puuished just as such odious egotism deserved to be.
The door of Jos's bed-room opened into the sitting-room which was
common to the family party, and opposite thie door was that of hmelia's
chamber. The buglcs hnd wakened everybody: there was no use in
concealment now. George's servant was packing in this room: Osborne
coming in nnd out of the contiguous bed-room, flinging to the man such
nrtiecles as he thought fit to carry on the campaign. And presently
Dobbin had the opportunity which his heart coveted, and he got sighlt of
Amelia's face once more. But what a face it wasl So white, so wild
nnd despair-stricken, that the remembrance of it haunted him afterwards
like a erime, and the sight smote im witl inexpressible pangs of longing
and pity.
She was wrapped in a white morning dress, her hair falling on her
shoulders, anl her large eyes fixed and without light. By way of helping
on the preparations for thc departure, and showing that she too could be
seful at a moment so criticnl, this poor soul had tken up a sash of
George's from the drawers whereon it lay, and followed him to and fro
with the sash in her hand, looking on mutely as his paeking proceedel.
She came out and stood, leaning at the wall, holding this snsh against her
bosom, from which the heavy net of crimson dropped like a large stain of
blood. Our gentle-hearted Cnptain felt a guilty shoek as he looked at
her. `Good God,'' thought he, `` and is it grief lke this I dnred to pry
into'' And there was no help: no menns to soothe and comfort this
helpless, speechless misery. Hle stool for a moment anl looked at her,
powerless and torn with pity, s a parent regards an infant in pain.
At last, George took Emmy's hand, and led her bnek into the bed-room,
from whence he came out alone. The parting hal taken place in that
moment, and he was gonc.

Thank Heaven thnt is over,'' George thought, bounding down the stair,
his sword under his arm, and as he ran swiftly to the alarm-ground, where
the regiment wus mustered, and whither trooped men and officers hurrying
from their billets, his pulse was throbbing and his cheeks flushed: the
great game of war was going to be played, and he one of the players.
What a fierce excitement of doubt, hope, and pleasure1 What tremendous
hazards of loss or gainl What were all the games of chance he had eer
played comparel to this one? Into all contests requiring athletic skill
anl courege, the young man, from is boyhood upwards, had flung him-
self with all his might. The champion of his sehool and his regiment,
the bravos of his companions had followed him everywhere; from the
boys' ericket-match to the garrison-races, he had won a hundrel of
triumphs; and wherever he went, women and nen had admired and
envied him. What qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a
return of applause, as those of bodily superiority, activity, and alour
Time out of mind strength anl courage have been the theme of bards and
romances; and from the story of Troy lown to to-duy, poetry has always
chosen a soldier for a hero. I wonder is it because men are cowurds in
heart that they admire bravery so much, and place military valour so far
beyond every other quality for reward and worship:
So, at the sound of tht stirring cll to attle, George jumped away
from the gentle arms in which he had been dallying; not without a feeling
of shame (nlthough his wife's hold on him had been but feeble), that he
should have been detainel there so long. The same feeling of eagerness
and excitement was amongst all those friends of his of whom wc have
had occassional glimpses, from the stout senior Major, who led the regiment
into action, to little Stubble, the Ensign, who was to bear its colours on
that day.
The sun was just rising as the march began-it was a gllant sight-
the bund led the column, playing the regimentul march-then came the
Major in command, riding upon Pyramus, his stout charger-then marched
the grenadiers, their captainu at their head; iu the centre were the colours,
borne by the senior and junior Lnsigns-then George came marcling at the
head of his company. He looked up, and smiled at Amelias, and passed
on; and cven the sound of the music died away.

lys was left in command of the little
colony at Brussels, with Mmelia ina-
lided, Isidor his Belgian servant, and
tlc  one, ho was maid-of-all-work
for the estublishment, as a garrison
under him. Though he was disturbed
in spirit, and his rest destroyed by
Dbbin's interruption and the occur-
rcnces of the morning, Jos nevertheless
renined for many hours in bed, wake-
ful and rolling about there until his
usual hour of rising had arrived. The sun was high in the hesvrens, and
our gallant friends of the -th miles on their march, efore the civilian
nppearel in his lowered dressing-gown at breakfast.
About George's absence, his brother-in-law was very easy in mind.
Perhaps Jos was rather pleased in his heart tht Osborne was gone, for
duriug eorge's presence, the other had played but a very seeondary part
in the household, and Osborne did not scruple to show his contempt for
the stout civilian. But Emmy had always een good and attentive to
him. It was she who ministered to his comforts, who superintended the
dishes that he liked, who walked or rode with him (as she had many, too
many, opportunities of doing, for where was George ) and who interposcd
her sweet kind face between his anger and her husband's scorn. Many
timid remonstrances had she uttered to George in behalf of her brother.
But the latter in his trenchnt way cut these entreaties short. I'm an
honest man,'' he sanid, ``and if I have n feeling I show it, as an honest an
will. How the deuce, my dear, would you have me behave respectfully
to such a fool as your brother'' So Jos was pleasel with George'a
absenee. HIis plain hat, and gloves on a sideboard, and the idea that
the owner was away, caused os I don't know what secret tlrill of plen-
sure. ``He won't be troubling me this orning,'' Jos thought, `` with his
dandified airs and his impudence.''
Put the Cnptain's hat into the ante-room,'' he said, to Isidor the
servant,
Perhaps he won't want it agin,'' replied the lackey, looking know-
ingly at his master. He hatel George too, whose insolenuce towards him
was quite of the English sort.
266
vAITY AIR.
:Mnd ask if Malam is coming to breakfast,'' Mr. Sedley said with
great majecsty, ashamed to enter with a servant upon the subject of his
dislike for George. The truth is, he hal abused his brother to the valet
a score of times before.
Alns Madam could not come to breakfast, and cut the tartines that
Mr. Jos likecd. Mandam was a great deal too ill, and hal been in a
frightful state cver since her husband's departure, so her bonne said. Jos
showcd his sympntly, by pouring her out n large cup of ten. It was his
way of exshibiting kindness: nnd he improed on this; he not only sent
hcr breakfast, but he bethought him what delicacies she would most like
for dinner.
Isidor, the valet, had looked on very sulkil, wlile Osborne's
servant was disposing of his master's baggnge previous to the Captain's
departure : for in the first place he hated Mr. Osborne, whese conduct to
him, and to all inferiors, was generally orerbearing, (nor does the conti-
nental domestic like to be trentel with insolence as our own better-tempered
scrvants do;) and sccondly, he was nngry that so many valuables should e
removed from uuder his hands, to fall into other people's possession when
the English discomfiture should arrivse. Of this defeat he and a st
number of other persons in Brussels and Belgium did not make the
slightest doubt. The almost universal belief was, that the Emperor would
divide the Prussian nnd English armics, annihilate one after the other, aud
mnrch into Brussels before three days were oer; when all the moveables
of lis present msters, who would be killed, or fugitives, or prisoners,
would lawfully become the property of Monsieur Isidor.
As he helped Jos tlrough his toilsome and complicated daily toilette,
this fnithful scrvant would calculate what he should do with the very
articles with which he was dccorating his master's person. IIc would
make a present of the silver essence-bottles and toilet knicknaceks to a
young lady of whom ho was fond; and keep the Englisl cutlery and the
large ruby pin for limself. It would look very smart upon one of the
fine frilled shirts, which, with the gold-laced cap and the froggel frock
cont, that might ecasily be cut down to suit lis slape, and the Captain's
gold-headed cane, and the great double ring with the rubies, which he
would have made into a pair of bcautiful earrings, he calculated would
ake a perfect Adonis of himselif, and render Mademoiselle Rcine an easy
prcy. ` How thosc sleeve-buttons will suit me,'' thought he, as he fixed
n pnir on the Iat pudgy wrists of Mr. Sedley. I long for sleeve-buttons;
and the Captain's boots with brass spurs, in the next room, corlen what an
cflect they will make in the Ale-Verle. So while Monsieur Isidor with

part of Jos's face, his imagination was rambling along the Green hvenue,
dressed out in a frogged coat and lace, and in company with Mademoiselle
Reine ; he was loitering in spirit on the banks, and examining the barges
sailing slowly under the cool shadows of the trees by the canal, or refresh-
ing himself with a mug of Faro at the bencl of a beer-house on the rond
to Laeken.
But Mr. Joseph Sedley, luckily for his own peace, no more kew what

perfectly unbearable. So Jos's man was marking his victim down, as

Amelia's attendnnt was much less selfishly disposcd. Fcew dependants
could come near that kind and gentle creuture without paying their usunl
tribute of loyalty and aflcetion to her sweet and affectionate nature. And
it is a fact that auline, the cook, consoled her mistrcss more than any-
body whom she saw on this wretched morning; for when she found how
Amelia remnined for hours, silent, mtionless, and haggnrd, by the win-
lows in which she hal plaeed herself to watch the last bnyonets of the
column as it marched away, tle honest girl took the ldy's hand, and said,
Tenee, MIadaue, est-ce u'il 'est pas aussi a larue, on lone ad moi '
with which she burst into tears, and Amelia falling into her arms, did
likewise, and so each pitied and soothed the other.
Several times during the forenoon Mr. Jos's Isidor wcnt from his lodg-
ings into the town, and to the gates of the hotels and lodging-louses
round about the larc, whcre the English werc congregated, and there
mingling with other valets, couriers, und lnckeys, gatherced such news as
was ahroad, and brought baek bulletins for his master's informution.
Almost all these gentlemen were in heart partisans of the Emperor, and
had their opinions about the speedy endl of the campaign. The Emperor's
proclamation from Avenes had been distributed everywhere plentifully in
Brusscls. `Soldieral'' it sail, ``this is the anniversary of Mnrcengo andFried-
land, by which the destinies of Europe were twice lecided. Then, as after
Austerlitz, as after Wagram, we were too generous. We believed in the
oaths and promises of princes whom we suffered to remain upon their
thrones. Let us march once more to meet them. We and they, are we not
still the same menP Soldiersl these same k'russians who are so arroguant
to-day, were three tq one against you at Jenn, and six to one nt Montmi-

comrades whnt frightful torments tley sufered on bonrl the English
hulks. Mndmen l a moment of prosperity has blinded them, and if they
enter into lFrance it will be to find a gravo therel'' But the partisnns
of the Freneh prophesied n more speedy extermination of thc Emperor's
enemies than this; and it was agreed on all hnnds that Prussinns and
British would never return cxcept as prisoners in the rear of the conquer-
ing army.
These opinions in the course of the day were brought to operate upon
MIr. Sedley. He wns told that the Dukce of Wcllington had gone to try
and rally his army, thc advance of which had been utterly erushed the
night before.

 Crushed, pshal'' said Jos, hose heort was pretty stout ut breakfast-
time. `Tle Duke has gone to beat the Emperor as e has beateu all his
generals before.''
His papers are burned, his effects are removel, and his quarters are
being got redy for the Duke of Dalmatia,'' Jos's inforant repliel. I
had it from his own mattre d'Mdtel. Milor Duc de Richemont's people are
paeking up everything. His Grace has fled already, and the Duchess is
only witing to see the plate packed to join the King of France at
Ostend,''
eThe King of France is at Ghent, fello,'' repliel Jos, affeeting inere-
dulity.
He fled last night to Bruges, and embarks to-dny from Ostend. The
Duke de Berri is taken prisoner. Those who wish to be safe hnl better
go soon, for the dykes will be open to-orrown, and who can fly when the
whole eountry is under water2''
Nonsense, Sir, we are three to one, Sir, against any force Bony can
bring in the field,'' Mr. Sedley objected; ``the Austrians and the Russians
nre on tleir march. He must, he slall be crushed,'' Jos said, slapping his
hand on the table.
 The Prussians were three to one at Jena, and e took their army and
kingdom iua week. They were six to one at Montmirail, and he scattered
tlem like sheep. The Austrian army is comiug, but with the Epress anl
the King of llome at its head; and the Russians, bah . the Russians will
withdraw. No quarter is to be giveu to the ELnglisl, on account of their
cruelty to our braves on board the infamous pontoons. Look here, here
it is in black and white. Here's the proclamation of his Mnjesty the
Emperor nnd King,'' said the now declared prtisan of Napoleon, and
taking the docuent from his pocket, Isidor sternly thrust it into his
naster's face, and alrendy looked upon the frogged coat and vluables as
his own spoil.
Jos was, if not seriously alarmed as yet, at least considernbly disturbed
in mind.  Gie me my coat and cap, bir,'' sail he, ``and follow me. I
will go myself and learn the truth of these reports.'' Isidor was furious as
Jos pt on the braidel froek. `Milor had better not wear that military
cont,'' snid he; ``the EFrenchmen have sworn not to give quarter to a single
British soldier.''
Silenee, Sirrall'' snid Jos, with a resolute countenanee still, and thrust
his arm into the sleee with indomitable resolution, in the perforance of
which heroic act he was found by Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, who nt this
juneture cme up to visit melia, and entered witlout ringing at the ante-
chamber door.
Rebeeca as dressed ery neatly and smartly, as usul; her quiet sleep
after Rawdon's departure had refreshed her, and her pink smiling cheeks
were quite pleasant to look at, in a town and on a day when everybody
else's countenance ore the appearance of the deepest anxiety and gloom.
She laughed at the attitude in which Jos was discovered, and the struggles
and convulsions with which the stout gentlenan thrust himself into the
braided coat.

chamber in which Amelia was.

eyes, und smelling tle cu-de-cologne with which it was scented.`'I

his hand upon the spot in question. ' You do me injustice, indecd yon

 I do, now your heart is true to your sister. Bnt I remember two
years ago-when it was false to me:'' Icbecca said, fixsing her eyes upon
him for nn instant, and then turniug away into thc window.
Jos blushed iolently. Thmt organ which he was aecused by Rebeec
of not possessing began to thump tumultuously. He recnllel the days
when he had fled from her, and the passion which had once inflamed him
-the days when he hnd driven her in his curricle : when she hnl knit the
green purse for him: wlen le had sate enraptured gazing at her whito

Is jealousy nothing P'' aaid lebeeca. e He makes me misorable
alout you. And whatever it might have been once-my heart is all his.
I am innocent now. Am I not, MIr. Sedley P''
All Jos's blood tingled with delight, as he surveyed this victim to his
ttractions. A few adroit words, one or two knowing tender glances of the
eyes, and his heart was inflamed again and his doubts and suspicions
forgotten. From Solomon downwards, have not wiser men than he been
cnjoled and befooled by women eeIf the worst comes to the worst,''
Becky thought, ``my retreat is secure; and I havce a right-hand seat in
tle brouch,''
There is no knowing into what declarations of love and ardour the
tumultous passious of Mr. Joseph might have led him, if Isidor the valet
had not made his re-appearanco at this minute, and begun to busy himself
ahout the domestic affuirs. Jos, who was just going to gasp out an avowal,
choked almost with the emotion that he was obliged to restrain. Rebecca
too bethought her that it was time she should go in and comfort her
dearest Amelia. ``u reoir,'' she suid, kissing her hand to MIr. Joseph,
and tapped gently at the door of his sister's apartent. As she entered
and closed the door on herself, he sank down in a ehair, nnd gazel and
sighed and pufed portentously. ` That oout is very tight for Mflor,''
Isidor said, still having his eye on the frogs; but his master leard him
not : his thoughts were elsewhere: now glowing, maddening, upon the
contemplation of the enchauting ebeeca : anon shriuking guiltily before
the vision of the jealous awdon Crawley, with lis curling, fierce mus-
tachios, anl his tcrrible duelling pistols londed and cocked.
Rebecca's appearance struck Amelia with terror, and made her shrink
back. It recalled her to the world and the remcmbrancee of yesterday.

feeling of anger succeeded, and from being deadly pale before, her face
flushed up red, and she returned Rebecca's look after a moment with a
steadiness which surprised and sonewhat abashed her rival.
 Denrest Amelia, you arc very unwell,'' the visitor said, putting forth
her hand to take Amelia's. e What is it? I could not rest until I kew
how you were.''
Anelia drew baek her hand-never since her life began had that gentle
sonl refused to believe or to answer any demonstration of good-will or
nffection. But she drew bacek her hand, and trembled all over.  Why
are you here, Rebecca'' she said, still looking at her solemnly with her
large eyes. Tlese glanees troubled her visitor.
 She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball,'' Rebeeca
thought.  Don't be agitated, dear Amelia,'' she said, looking down.

`Look,'' snid Amelia, ` this is his sash-isn't it a pretty colour:'' nnd
she took up the fringe and kissel it. She hnd tied it round hor waist ant
some part of the day. She had forgotten her anger, her jelousy, the very
presence of her rival seemingly. For she wnlked silcntly and almnost with
a smile on lcr face, towards tle bed, and begnn to smooth down George's
pillow.

ery unwell'' and she went nway with n very grave fnce, refusing Mr,
Sedley's entreaties that shc would stay and partuke of the enrly dinner
which he had ordered.
Releeea was of a good-naturel and obliging disposition; and she likel
Amelin rather tha otherwise. Even her hard words, reproachful as they
were, were complimentary-tle groans of a person stinging under defent.
Meeting Mrs. O'Dowd, whom the Dean's sermons hnd by no means com-
forted, nnd wlo was walking very disconsolately in thie Parc, Rebeeea
nccosted the latter, rather to the surprise of the Mnjor's wife, who was not
aecustomed to such mnrks of politeness from Mrs. Rawdon Crnwley, and
informing her that poor little MIrs. Osborne was in a desperate condition,
nnd almost mnd with grief, sent off the gool-natured Irishwoman straight
to see if she eould console her young favourite.
I've cares of my own enough,'' Mrs. O'Dowd said, grarely, '` and I
tlought poor Amclia would be little wanting for company this day. lBut
if le's so bad as you say, and you cn't uttend to her, who used to be so
fond of her, faith I 'll see if I can be of service. And so good marning to
ye, Mndnm ;'' with whicl speech and a toss of her headl, the lndy of the
repayther took a farcwell of Mrs. Crawley, whose compny she by no
means courted.
Becky wntched her mareling off, with a smile on her lip. She hal the
keenest sense of humour, and the Pnrthian look which the relreating Mrs.
O'Dowd flung over her shouller almost upset MIrs. Crawley's gravsity.
 My service to ye, me fine Mndam, and I'm glad to see ye so
cheerful,'' thought Pcggy. ``It 's not you that will cry your eyes out
writh grief, any way,'' Anl with this sle passed on, and speedily founl
her way to Mrs. Osborne's lodgings.
The poor soul was still at the helside, where Rehecca had left her, and
stood almost crazy with grief. The Major's wife, n strongcr minded
worman, endeavoured her best to comfort her young friend,  ou must

copany. hey went on till two o'clock; their hearts were with the
column as it marched further and further away. Drealful doubt and
anguish-prayers and fears and griefs uspeakable-followel the regimeut.
It was the women's tribute to the war. It taxes both ulike, and takes
the blood of the men, and the tears of tle women.
At half-past two an event occurred of daily importance to Mr. Joseph:
the dinner hour arried. Warriors msy fight and perish, but he must
ine. He came into Amelia's room to see if he could coax her to share
that meal.  Try,'' said he; `'the soup is very good. Do try, Emmy,''
nnd he kissed her hand. lExcept whcn she was arried, he had not done
aso much for years before.  Yon are very gool and kinl, Joseph,'' she
sai.  Everybody is, but, if you please, I ill stay in my room to-day.''
The savour of the soup, however, was agreeable to Mrs. O'Dowd's
ostrils: und she thought she would bear Mr. Jos company. So the two
sate down to their meal.  God bless the meat,'' said the Major's wife,
solemuly: she was tlinking of her honest Mick, riding at the hed of lis
regumnent :  'Tis but a bad dinuer those poor boys will get to-day,'' sha
sil, with a sigh, and then, like a plilosopher, fell to.
Jos's spirits rose with his meal. He would drink the regiment's health;
or, indeed, take any other excuse to indulge in n glass of champagne.
eWe 'Il drink to O'Dowd and the brave -th,'' snid he, bowing gal-
lantly to his guest.  Hey, Mrs. O'Donl. TFill Mrs. O'Dowd's glass,
Isidor.''
But all of a sudden, Isidor started, and the MIajor's wife laid down her
knife and fork. The windows of the room were open, and looked south-
ward, and a dull distant sound came over the sun-lighted roofs from that
lirection. : What is itP'' sid Jos. :Why don't you pour, you rscal ''
 C'est le fe,'' said Isidor, running to the balcony.

followed too to the window. A thousand pale and anxious fuces ight
have been seen looking from other casemcnts. And presenutly it seemed
as if the wlole population of the city rushed iato tle streets.

Crowds rushed to thc

ceeded, and mauy role

intelligence from the
ary. Each man askel
his neighbour for news;
and even great English lords and ladies condescended to speak to persons
whom they did not know. The friends of the French went abroad, wild witl
excitement, and prophecying the triumph of their Emperor. The mer-
chants closel thleir shops, anl came out to swell the general chorus of nlarm
and clamour. Women rushed to the churches, and crowded the chapels, and
knelt and prayed on thc flags and steps. The dull souud of the cannon went
on rolling, rolling. Presently carringes with travellers began to leave tle
town, galloping away by the Ghent bnrrier. The prophecies of the French
partisans egau to pass for facts. ``He has cut the armies in two,'' it was
said. IIe is marching straiglt on Brussels. He will overpower th
English, and be here to-nigll.''  IHe will overpower the Lnglish,''
shrieked Isilor to his master, ``and will be here to-night.'' The man
bounded in and out from the lodgings to the street, always returning with
some fresh particulars of disaster. Jos's face grew paler and paler.
Alarm began to take entire possession of the stout civilian. All the
champagne he drnnk brought no courage to him. Before sunset he was
worked up to such a pitch of nervousness as gratified his frienl Isidor to
behold, who uow counted surely upon the spoils of the owner of the laced
cont.
The women were away all this time. After hearing the firing for a
moment, the stout Major's wife bethought her of her friend in the next
chamber, and ran in to watch, and if possible to console, Amelia. The
idea that she had that helpless and gentle creature to protect, gwve
additional strength to the natural courage of the honest Irislwoman. She

times talking cheerlully, oftener in silecnce, und terrified mental supplica-
tion. I never let go her hand once,'' suid the stout lady afterwnrds,
`until after sunset, whcn the firing was over.'' Pauline, the loune, was
on her knees at church hard ly, prayiug for son omme a elle.
When the noise of the cannonating was over, MIrs. O'bDowd issued out of
Mmelia's room into the parlour adjoining, where Jos sate with two emptied
flasks, and courage entirely gone. Once or twsice he had entured into his
sister's bed-room, looking very much alarmed, and as if he would say
something. But the ajor's wife kept her place, and he went awuy with-
out lisburthening himself of his speech. He wns ashamed to tell her that
he wanted to fly.
But when she made her appearance in the dining-room, where he sate
in the twilight in the cheerless company of his empty clpague-bottles,
he began to open his mind to her.
Mrs. O'Dowd,'' he snil, '` hadn't you better get Amelia redy ?''
`Are you going to take her out a wnlk '' said the Major's lndy;

his foot energetically.  `I say tle horses are ordered-yes, the horses are
ordered. It's all over, and-''
 And what'' asked Mrs. O'Dowd.
eI'm off for Ghent,'' Jos anewerel. : Evoryboly is going; there'sa
place for you. We shall start in hnlf-an-hour.''
The Major's wife looked aut him with infinite scorn. ` Idon't move till
O'Dowl gives me the route,'' snid she. : You may go if you like, Mr.
Sedley; but, faith, Amelia and I stop here.''
tShe slall go,'' snid Jos, with another stamp of his foot. Mrs. O'Dowl
put herself with arms ukimbo before the bed-room door.
`Is it her mother you're goiug to take her to 2'' she said; '` or do you
want to go to Mammn yourself, Mr. Sedley? Good marning- pleasant
journcy to ye, sir. Bon oyage, as they say, nnd take my counsel, and

D-n I'' yelled out Jos, wild with fenr, rge, and mortification; nnd
Isidor came in at this juncture, swearing in his turn. Pas de chevatr,

Jos was not the only man in Brussels seized with panic that day.
But Jos's fenrs, grent and cruel ans they were nlready, were destined to
increase to an almost frnntic pitch before the night was over. It has been
mentioned ho Pauline, tle onne, had on love d elle, aleo in thc ranks
of the arny that had gone out to mcet the Emperor Napoleon. This
lover was a native of Brussels, aud a Belgian hussar. The troops of his
nation signalized themselves in this war for anytling but courage, nnd

Regulus (he had been orn in thc revolutionary times) found his great
comfort, and passed almost all his leisure moments in Pauline's kitchen;
and it was with poekets and holstere crammed full of good things from
her larder, that he had taken leave of his weeping sweetheart, to proceed
upon the campaign a few days elore.
As fur as his regiment wns concerned, this cnmpaign was ovcr now.
They hnd forcd a part of the division under the command of his Sovereign
apparent; the Prince of Orange, and as respected length of swords and
ustachios, and the richness of uniform and equipments, legulus and
his comrades looked to bc as gullant a body of men as ever trumpets
sounded for.
WYhen Ney dashed upon the advauce of the alliel troops, carrying one
position after the othcer, nntil th arrival of the great body of the British
anny from Brussels changed the aspect of the combat of uatre Bras, the
squadrons aiong which Regulus role showcd the greatest activity in
retreating before the lrench, and wcre dislodged from one post and another
whicl they oeeupied with perfect nlacrity on their part. Their movements
were only checked by the alvance of the British in their rceur. lhus
force to halt, the enemy's cnvalry (whose bloothirsty obstinacy cannot
be too severely reprehnded) had at length an opportunity of coming to
close quarters with the brave RBelgians beforo them; who preferred to
cucounter the British rather thnn the French, and at once turning tail rode
through the knglish regiments thnt were belind them, and scnttered in all
directions. The regiment in fuact lid not exist any more. It wasnowhere.
It had no head quarters. Regulus found limself galloping many miles from
the field of action, entirely alone; and whither should he fly for rcfugo so
uaturally us to that kitchen and thosc fnithful arms in which lnuline had
so often welcomed him?
At some ten o'clock the clinking of a sabre might have been heard up
the stair of the house where the Osbornes occupied n storey in thc cou-
tinental fashion. A knock might have been heard nt the kitchcn door;
and poor Pauline, come back ifron church, fainted almost with terror as
she opened it and saw before her her laggnrd hussar. He lookel as pale
as the midnight dragoon who came to disturb Leonora. Pnuliue would
have screamed, but that her cry would have culled her masters, nnd dis-
covcred her iriend. She atifled her scream, then, and lending her hero
into the kitchen, gave him beer, and the choiee bits from the dinner, which
Jos had not had the heart to taste. The hussar showed he was no ghost
by the prodigious quantity of lesh und beer whicl he devoured-and
during the mouthfuls he told his tale of disaster.
His regiment had performed prodigies of courage, and had withstood
for a while the onset of the whole rench army. But they were over-
whelmed at last, as was the whole British army by this time. Ney
destroyed ench regiment as it cameup. The lBelgians in vain iuterposed
to preent the butchery of the English. Tho Brunswvickers were routed
and had fled-their Duke wns killed. It was a genernl delicle. He
sought to drown his sorrow for the defent in floods of beer.
Isidor, wo had come into the kitchen, heard tho conversation, and
rushed out to inform his master.  `It is all ovcr,'' he shrieked to Jcs.

ofbeer. In the best French wlich hce could muster, and which was in sooth
of a very ungrammatical sort, Jos besought the hussar to tell his tale.
The disnsters deepened as Reguls spoke. He was the only man of his
regiment not slain on the field. He had seen the Duke of Brunswick full,
the blnck hussars fly, the Ecossais pounded down by the cannon.
``And the -th?'' gasped Jos.
Cut in pieees,'' said the hussar-upon which Pauline crying out, ``O
my mistress, ma boune petite dae,'' went off fairly into hysterics, and
filled the house with her screams.
Wil with terror, MIr. Sedley knew not how or where to seek for safety.
He rushed from the kitchen back to the sitting-room, and cast an appeal-
ing look at Amelia's door, which Mrs. O'Dowl had closed and loeked in
lis face; but he remembered how scornfully the latter had eceived him,
and after pausing nnd listeuing for a brief spaee at the door, he left it,
nnd resolsed to go into the street, for the first time that day. So, seizing
an candle, hc looked about for his gold-laced cap, and found it lying in its
sual place, on a console-table, in the ante-room, placed before s mirror
at which Jos used to coquet, always giving his side-locks a twirl, and his
cap the proper cock over his eye, before he wcut forth to make appearance
in publie. Such is the force of habit, that even in the midst of his terror

They will mistake me for a military man, thought he, remembering Isidor's
warning, as to the massacre with which all the defeated British army ws

the bell which summoned his valet.
Isidor answered that summons. Jos had sunk in a chair-he had torn
off his neckcloths, and turned down his collars, and was sitting with both
his hands lifted to his throat.

Isidor thought for a moment he had gone mad, and that le wished lis

or of the allied army, ulmost, who had eseaped bcing cut to picces by Ney, it
appeared that his statement was incorrect, and that a good number more
of the supposcd victimns had survived the mussaere. Mlany scores of
Regulus's comrades had found their way back to Brusscls, und-all agrce-
ing that thcy had run away-filled the whole town with an iden of the
defeat of thc allies. The nrrivnal of the French was expected hourly; the
panic continued, and preparations for flight went on everywhere. No
horsesl thoughl Ios, in terror. IIe made lsidor inquire of scores of
persons, whcther they had any to lend or sell, and his henrt sank within
him, at the negative answers returued everywhere. Should he take the
journey on foot? Even fear could not render that ponderous body so
nctive.
Almnost all the hotels occupiel by the English in 3russels face the
Parc, and Jos wandered irresolutely about in this quarter, with crowds
of other people, oppressed ans he wns by fecar and curiosity. Soe families
he saw more hnppy than hiself, having discovered a team of horses, and
rattling through the streets in retreat; others agin there were whose case
was like his own, and who could not for any bribes or cutrcaties proeure
the necessary means of flight. Amongst these wonuld-be fugities, Jos
remarked the Lady Bureaceres and her daughter, who satein theircarriage
in the prte-coelre of their lotel, all their imperials packed, and the
only lrawback to whose flight was the same want of motivce power which
kept Jos stationary.
Rebecta Crawley occupied apartments in this hotel ; and had before this
period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladics of the Bareacres
family. My Lady bBareacres cut Mrs. Crawley on the stairs when thcy
met by chance; ad in nll places whcere the latter's name was mnen-
tioned, spoke perscvcringly ill of her neighbour. The Countess was
shocked at the familiarity of (eneral lufto with the aide-dc-camp's wife.
The Lndy Blanche avoided her as if she had been nn infectious liscease.
Only the Eurl himself kept up a sly occeasional acuaintance with her, when
out of the jurisliction of his ladies.
Rebeecna lad her revenge now upon these insolent cnemies. It became
known in the hotel that Cnptain Crawlcy's horses had bcen left behind, ad
when the panic began, Lady Darecres condesccnded to send her maid to
the Cnptain's wife with her Ladyship's compliments, an a desire to know
the price of MIrs. Crawley's lorses. Mrs. Crawlcy returned a note with hcr

burgains with lalies' maids.
This curt reply brought the Earl in person to Becky's apartment ; but
he could get no more success than the first ambssador. `` Send a lady's

the auswer that the Enrl bore back to his Conntess.
What ill not neccssity do Thce Countcss herself actually came to
wait upon Mrs. Crawley ou the failure of her second cnvoy. She entrcnted
her to nnme her own price; she even ollered to invite lBecky to lareacres

two hours, and I shall be hlf way to Ghent by that time. I would not

liuons were sewed into her habit, and secreted in y Lord's padting
and boots. `Womnn, the diumonds rc at the nker's, and I ill have
the horses,'' she said. Rebecca laughed in her fuce. The infuriate Coun-

husbnnd were sent once more through the town, eacl to look for cattle; and

llebecca had the pleasure of seeing her Lalship in the horseless car-
riage, and keeping her eyes fixel upon her, nd bewailing, in the loulest
tone of voice, the Countess's perplexities. `Not to bce able to get lorsces!''
she said, `` and to have all those diamonds sewcd in to the curriage cushionsl
What a prize it will be for the French whcn they come l-the caringe and

thc landlord, to the servants, to the guests, and the innumerable stragglcrs
about the court-yard. Lady Bareaeres coult have shot her from the car-
riage-window.
It was while enjoying the humiliation of her enemy tht Rcbeeca cuglt
sight of Jos, who made towards ler directly he perceivedl her.
That altered, frightened, fat face, told his secret wecll enough. He

Besides, I don't want to desert her,'' cried te brother.  She sha't
e deserted. There is  seat for her in my carriage, and one for you, dear
Mrs. Crawley, if you will come; and if wve can get horses-'' sighed he-
I have to to sell,'' tle lady said. Jos could hase flung himself into
her arms nt the news. `' Get tle carriage, Isilor,'' he cried; ` we 'vc
found them-we have found them.''
My horses never were in harness,'' added the lady. ``Bulfinuch would
kick the carriage to pieces, if you put him in tle traces.''
But hc is quiet to ride?'' asked the ciilian.
As quiet ns a lamb, anl as fst as a hare,'' answered Rebceea.
Do you think he is up to my weiglt?'' Jos said. HIe wns already
on his back, in imagination, without ever so much as a thought for poor
Amelia. What person who loed a horse-speculation could resist such a
temptation
In rcply, Rebecea asked him to come into her room, wlither he followel
her quitc brcnthless to conclude the bargain. Jos seldom spent a hnlf
hour in his life which cost him so much money. Rebecca measuring the
valuc of the goods which she had for sale by Jos's eagerness to purchasc,
as ell as hy the scarcity of the article, put upon her horses a price so
prodigious as to makc even the civilian draw baek.  She would sell
both or ncithor,'' she snid, resolutely. Rnwdon had orderel her not to
part with the for n price less than that which she specified. Lord
lareaceres below would give her the same money-and with all her love
and regarl for the Sedley fumily, er dear Mr. Joseph must conecive that
poor pcople must live-nohody, in n word, could be more aflectionate, but
more firm about the matter of busiuess.
Jos endcd by agreeing, as might be supposel of him. The sum he ad
to givc her wns so large that he was obliged to ask for time; so large as
to be a little fortune to Rebecca, who rapidly cnleulnted that wcith this
sum, and the snle of the residue of Rawdon's effects, and her pension as a
widow should he fnll, she would now be absolutely independent of the
world, and miglt look her weeds steadily in the face.
Once or twice in the dny she certainly hal herself thought about flyiug.
But her reason gave her better counsel. ``Supposo the French do come,''
thought Becky, 'what can they do to a poor officer's widow2 Bahl tle
times of sacks and sieges arc over. We shall be let to go hoe quietly,
or I may live plesantly nbroad with a snug little income.''
Mennwhile Jos and Isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly-
purchascd cattle. Jos bade his man saddle the horses at once. He
would ride away that very night, that very hour. And he left the valet
busy in getting the horses reudy, and went homewards himself to prepare
for his departure. It must be secret. oe would go to his chmber by
the back entrance. He did not care to faee Mrs, O'Dowd and Amelia,
and own to them tlat he was about to run.
By the time Jos's bnargain with Rebeeca was completed, and his horses
had been visited anl exnmined, it was almost morning oncee more. But

thongh midnight was long passed, there was no rcst for the city ; the
people were up, the lights in the houses flamel, crowds were still about
the doors, and the streets were busy. Rumours of various natures went
still from mouth to mouth: one report nverrel that the Prussians had bcen
tterly defented; another thant it was the English who had been attacked
nnd conquered; a third tht the latter hnd held their ground. This
last rumour gradually got strength. No Frenchmen had made tlcir
appearance. Stragglers ad come in from the ary bringing reports more
and more favourable: nt lnst an aide-le-camp actunlly reached Brussels
with despatches for the Commandant of the place, who placarded presently
through the town an official annonuncement of thc success of the allies at
(uatre Bras, and the entire repulse of the French under Ney after a six
hours' battle. The aide-de-cnmp must have arrived sometime while Jos
and Rebecca were mnking their bnrgain together, or the latter was iuspeet-
ing his purchase. When ho reachel his own hotel, he found a score of its
numerous inhabitants on the threshold discoursing of the news; there was
no doubt as to its truth. Mnd he went up to communicate it to the ladies
under his carge. lIe did not think it was necessry to tell them how he
had intendel to take lenve of them, how he huad bought horses, and whata
price he huad paid for them.
But success or defeat was a minor matter to them, who had only thought
for the salety of those thcy loved. Amelia, at the news of te victory,
becme still more ngitated even thn before. She was for going that mo-
ent to the army. She besought her brother with tears to conduct her
thither. IIer loubts and terrors renchcd their paroxysm; and tle poor
girl, who for many hours had bcen plunged into stupor, raved and ran
hither and thither in hysteric insanity-a piteous sight. No man writhing
in pain on the hard-fought fiell fiftcen milecs ofl, where lay, after their
struggles, so many of the brave-no mn sufflerecd more keeuly than this
poor harmless vietim of the war. Jos could not bear the sight of her pain.
IIe left his sister in thc charge of her stouter female companion, and
descended once more to the threslold of the hotel, wherc eerybody still
lingered, anl talked, and wnitel for more ncws.
It grew to be brond lylight as they stood lere, and fresh news began
to arrive from the war, brought by men who had bcen actors in the scene.
Wnggons and long country carts laden with wounded cne rolling into tlc
towu; ghastly grons cme from within thcm, and haggard faces looked up
sadly from out of the straw. Jos Sedley was looking at one of tliese
carriages with a painful curiosity-the moans of the people within were
frightfnl-the wearied horses could hardly pull thc cart. Stopl stopl a
feeble voice cried from the struw, nd the carriage stopped opposite MIr.

in a cart, and h had been brought back to russele.
eMIr. Sedley, Mr. SedleyI'' ericd the hoy faint'y, and Jos came up
almost frightened at the appeal. IIe had not at frst distinguished who
it was that cnlled lim.
Little Tom ttulble held out his lot nnd feeble hand. I'm to be
taken in here,'' he said.  Osborne-and-and Dobbin said I was; and
you are to give the man two Napoleons : my mother will pay you.'' Tlis
young fellow's thoughts, during the long feverish hours passed in the
cnrt, had been wandering to his father's parsonnge which he had quitted
only a few montls before, and he nd sometimes forgotten lis pain in
that delirium.
Tue hotel was large, and the people kind, anl all the inmates of the
cart were taken in and placed on various couches. he young ensign
was convcyet up-stairs to Osborne's quarters. Amelia and the MIajor's
wife had rushed down to him, when the luatter had recoguized him from thc
bnl]cony. ou may fancy the fcelings of these women when they ere
told that the day was over, and both their husbands wcre safe; in what
mute rnpture Amelia fell on her good friend's neck, and embraced her;
in what n grateful passion of prayers she fell on her knees, and thanked
the Power which had snved her husband.
Our young lady, in her fevered and nervous condition, could have had
no ore snlutary medicine prcseribed for her by any physician tan tlat
which chance put in her way. She and Mrs. O'Dowd watched incessantly
by the wounded lad, whose pains were very severe, and in the duty thus
forced upon her, Amelia had not time to brood over her personal anxieties,
or to give herself up to hcr own fars and forebodings after her wont.
The young patient told in his simplc fashion the cvents of the day, and
the nctions of our friends of the gallnnt -th. They hal suffered
severely. They hd lost very many oflicers and men. The Injor's
horse had been shot under him as the regiment charged, nnd they all
thought that O'Dowd was gone, and tht Dohbin lad got lis majority,
until on their return from the charge to their old ground, the Mjor
was discovered seated on yramus's carcase, refreshing himself from a
case-bttle. It wns Cnaptain Osborue that cut down the rencl lnnoer
wlio hnd spcarcd the cnsign. Amelian turned so pale at the notion, that
MIrs. O'Dowd stopped the young ensign in this story. And it was Cap-
tain Dobbin who at thce end of thc day, tlough wounded himself, took up
the Inad in his arms and carried him to the surgeon, nnd thence to the cart
which was to bring him back to I3russels. And it wns he who promisel
the lriver two louis if he would ake his way to Mr. Sedley's hotel in
1he city; and tell Mrs. Captin Osborne that the actiou was over, and that
her husband was unhurt and well.

she thought about him.
In tending her patient, and in thinking of the wonderful esenpes of the

but it was after a severe and doubtful struggle, and with only a division of
the French army. Thce Emperor, with tle main oly, was away at Ligny,
where he had uttcrly annihilated the Prussians, and was now fre to bring
his whole forceo to bear upon tho allies. 1he Duke of Wellington was
retreating upon the capitl, and a grcat battlc must be fought under its
wulls probably, of which the chanccs were more than doubtful. The Duke
of Wellington had but twenty thousand DBritish troops on wlom he could
rely, for the Germans were raw militia, the Belginns disaffected; and with
this handful his Grace had to resist a hundred and fifty tlousanl men that
had broken into Belgium under Nanoleon. Under Nnpoleon 1 What warrior
was thcre, however famous nnd skilful, that could fight at olds witl him
Jos thought of all these tlings, anl trembled. So dil all the rest of
Brussels-where people felt that the fglt of the duy efore was but the
prelude to the grenter eombat which was imminent. One of the armies
opposed to tle Lmperor was scattered to the winds already. The few
English that could be brouglt to resist him would perish at thcir posts,
and the conqueror would pass over their bodies into the city. Woe be to
those whom he found therel Addresses were prepared, public function-
aries assembled and debntol secretly, apartments were got realy, and
tricooloured banners and triumphal emblems manufactured, to welcome tle
arrival of His Mjesty the Empcror and King.
The emigration still continued, and wlerever familics could find means
of departure, they fled. When Jos, on the afternoon of the 17th of June,
went to Rebeeca's hotel, he found that the great DDareacres' cnrriage had at
length rolled away from the porte-coclere. The Enrl had procurecd a pai
of horses somehow, in spite of Mrs. Crawley, and was rolling on the road
to Ghent. Louis the Desired, was geting ready his portmnnteau in that
city, too. It seemed as if Miafortune was never tired of worrying into
motion that unwieldy exile.
Jos felt that the delay of yesterday had been only a rcspite, and that his
dearly bought horses must of a surety le put into requisition. His
agonies were ery severe all this day. hs long as there was an Lnglish
nrmy between Brussels nnd Napoleon, there was no need aof immediate
flight; but he had his horses brouglt from their distant stables, to the
stables in the court-yard of the hotel where he lived; svo tlat tcy might
be under his own eyes, and beyond tle risk of violent abuction. Isidor
watched the stable-door constantly, and had the horses saddled, to be rcady
for the start. He longed intensely for that ovent.

her, and gave fresh wntcr to the flowers, and read oer the letter which
he had sent her.  Poor wretch,'' she said, twirling round the little bit
of paper in her fingers, ``how I could crush her with thisl-and it is for
a thing like this that she must break her heart forsooth-for a man wlo
is stupid-a eoxcomb-nnd who does ot cnre for her. My poor good
Rawlon is worth ten of this creature.'' And then she fell to tlinking
what she should do if-if anything happened to poor good Rawdon, and
what a great piece of luck it was that he had left his horses behind.
In the course of this day too, Mrs. Crawley, who saw not without anger
the Bareacrcs party drive off, becthought her of the precaution which the
countess had taken, and did a little needlewvork for own advantage; she
stitced nway the major purt of her triukets, bills, nnd bank-notes about
her person, and so prepared, was rendy for any cvent-to fly if shie
thought fit, or to stay nnd welcome the couqueror, were he Englishmau or
Frenchmnan. And I am not sure that she did not dreu that night of
becoming a duchess and Madame la Marchale, wlile Rawdon wrapped in
his cloak, and making his bivouac under the rain at Mount Saint John,
was thinking, with all the force of lis heart, about the little wife whom he
nad left behind him.
The next day was  Sunday. Anl MIrs. Mjor O'Dod hal the satis-
faction of seeing both her patients refreshcd in health and spirits by some
rest which they hal taken during the night. She lerself had slept on a
great chair in Amelia's room, ready to wait upon her poor friend or
the ensign, should eithcr need her nursing. WYhen morning came, tlis
robust woman went back to the house where she and her MIajor had their
billet; nnd here performed n claborate nnd splendid toilette, bcfitting the
dy. And it is very possible thal whilst alone in that chamber, which
her husbanl had inhabited, and where his cnp still lay on the pillow, and
his cane stood in the corner, one prayer at lenst was sent up to Heaven
for the welfare of the brave soldier, Michael O'Dowd.
WYhen she returned she brought her prayer-book with ler, and her
ncle the Dean's famous book of sermons, out of which she never fniled to
rend every Sabbath: not understanding all, haply, not pronouncing many
of the words aright, which were long and abstruse-for the Dean was a
learned mau, and loved long Latin words-but with great graity, vast
cmphasis, and with tolerable correctness in the main. How often has my
Mick listenel to these sermous, she thought, and me reading in the cabin
of a cnlm. She proposed to resuc this exercise on the present day, with
Amelia and the wounded ensign for a congregation. The same service
was read on that day in twenty thousand churches at the same hour; and
millions of British mcn anl women, on their knees, implored protection of
the Futher of all.
They did not hcar the noise which listurbed our little congregation at
Brusscls. Much louder thnn that vlich had interrupted them two day
previously, as Mrs. O'Dowd was reading the service in her best voice, the
cannon of Waterloo began to roar.

appenl to Amelia.

you must come with me. I have bought a horse for you-never mind
nt what price-and you must dress and come with me, and ride belind
Isidor.''
God forgive me, Mr. Sedley, but you are no better than a coward,''
Mrs. O'Dowd said, laying down the book.
`:I say coe, Amelin,'' the civilian went on; ``never mind what she
says; why arc we to stop here and be butchered by the Frenchmen ?''
 You forget the -th, my boy,'' said the little Stubble, the wounled
hero, Irom his bed-``and-and you won't leavse me, will you, Mrs.
O'Dowd'
No, y der fellow,'' snid she, going up nd kissing the boy. No
har shall come to you while I stand by.  I don't budge till I get the
worl from Mick. A pretty figure I'd be, wouldn't I, stuck belind that

This iage made the young patient to burst out laughing in his bed,
and even made Amelia smile.  I don't ask her,'' Jos shouted out-tI
don't ask that-that Irishwomn, but you, Amelia; once for all, will you

Without my husband, Joseph?'' Amelia said with a look of wonder,

door by which he retreated. And tlis time he really gave lis order for

for some days, were lively, nnd sprang about the street. Jos, a clumsy
and tiid horseman, did not look to udvantage in tle saddle. ` Look at
hi, Aelia, denr, driving into the parlour window. Such n bull in n

at a canter down the street lcaling in the direction of the Ghent road.

in sight.
All that day from moruing until past sunset, the cannon never cesed to
roar. It was dark when tle cannonading stopped all of a sudlen.
All of us have read of what occurred during tlat interval. The tale is
in every Englishman's mouth; and you and I, who were clildren when
the great buttle wss won and lost, are never tired of learing anl recount-

a contest, ending in a victory on their part, should ensue, elating them in
their turn, and leaving its cursed legacy of hatred and rage behind to us,

there are a number of persons living
peaceably in England wlo have to
lo with the history at present in
hand, and must comne in for their
share of the chronicle. During the
time of these battles and dangers,
old Miss Crawley was living at
Briglton, very moderately moved
by the great events that were going
on. The great events rendered the
newapapers rather interesting, to be sure, and Briggs read out the Gazette,
in which Rawdon Crawley's gallautry was mentioned with honour, and his
promotion to be Lieutenant-Colonel was presently recorded.
 What a pity that young man has taken such in irretrievble step in the
world,'' his aunt said; '' with his rank and listinction e might have married
a brewer's daughter with a quarter of a million-like Miss Grains; or have
looked to ally himself with the best fumilies in England. He would have
had my money eome day or other; or his children would-for I'm not
in a hurry to go, Miss Briggs, ualthough you may he in a hurry to be
rid of me; and instead of that, he is a doomed pnuper, with a dancing-
 girl for a wite.''
 Will my dear Miss Crawley not cast an eye of compassion upon
the heroic soldier, whose name is inscribed in the annals of his country's
glory 2'' said Miss Briggs, who was greatly excited by the Waterloo
proceedings, and loved speaking romantically when there was an occnsion.

abandoned wretch, I wonder, of whose vile arts he beceame a victim, and
of whom you used to be such an admirer Ies, I daresay you were an
nccoplice. But you will find yourself disappointed in my will, I can
tell you: and you will have the goodness to write to Mr. Waxy, and say
that I desire to see him immediately.'' Miss Crawley was now in the
habit of writing to Mr. Waxy her solicitor almost every day in the week,
for her arrangements respecting her property were all revoked, and her
perplexity was great as to the future disposition of her money.
The spinster had, however, rallicd considerably; as was proved by the
increased vigour nand frequency of her sarcasms upon Miss Briggs, all
which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness, with cowardice,
with a resiguation that was hnlf generous, and lalf hypocritical-with the
slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and station
are compelled to show. Who has not seen how women bully women:
WYhat tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily-repeated
shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by thc
tyrants of tleir sexP Poor victimsl But we are starting from our
proposition, which is, that MIiss Crawley was always particularly annoy-
ing and savage when she was rullying from illness-as they say wounds
tingle most when they are about to heal.
WVhile thus approacing, as all hoped, to convlescence, Miss Briggs
was the only victim admitted iuto the presence of the iuvalid; yet Miss
Crawley's relaties afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman, and by
a number of tokens, presents, nnd kind affectionate messages, stroe to
keep thenselves alive in her recollection.
In the first place, let us mention her nephew, Rawdon Crawley. A
few weceks after the famous fight of Watlerloo, and after the Gazette had
ade known to her the promotion nnd gullantry of that distinguishel
fficer, the Dicppe packet brouglt over to Miss Crawley at Brighton, a
oox containing presents, and a dutiful letter, from the Colonel her nephew.
In the box were a pair of French epaulets, a Cross of the ILegion of
Honour, and the hilt of a sword-rclics from the field of battle: and the
letter described with a good deal of humour low the latter belonged to a
commanding-offieer of the Guard, who havig sworn that ` the Guard
lied, but never surreudered,'' was taken prisoner the next minute by a
privute soldier, who broke the Frenchman's sword with the butt of his
musket, when Rawdon made himself master of the shattered weapon.
As for the eross d epaulets, they came from a Colonel of French
cavalry, who had fnllen under the aide-de-camp's arm in the battle: and
Rawdon Crawley did not know what better to do with the spoils than
to send them to his kindest and most affectionate old friend. Should
he continue to write to her from Paris, whither the army was marehing 
Ie might be able to give er interesting news from that capital, and
of some of Miss Crawley's old friends of the emigration, to whom she
had shown so much kindness during their distress.
The spinster caused Briggs to write back to the Colonel a gracious
nnd complimentury letter, encouragng him to continue his correspondence.
HIis first letter was so excessively lively and amusing that she should look
with pleasure for its suceessors.- Of course I know,'' she explained to
A NOVEL WITHROUT A HERO.
291
Miss Briggs, '` thnt Rawdon could not write such a good letter any more
thn you could, my poor Briggs, and that it is that cleer little wretcl ol
na ebecca, who dictates cvery word to him; but that is no reason why
my nephew should not amuse me; and so I wish to let him understand
that I am in high good-hnmour.''
I wonder whether she knew thut it was not only llecky who wrote the
letters, but thnt Mrs. Rnwlon actually took and sent home the trophies-
which she bought for n few franes, from one of the innunerable pedlars,
who immediately becgn to deal in relics of the war. The novelist, who
knows cverything, knuows this also. Be this, however, ns it may, Miss
Crawley's gracious reply greatly encouraged our young fricnds Hawdon
nnd his lady, who hoped for the bcst from their aunt's eidently pacified
humour: and they took care to entertnin her with muany deligltful
letters from Pris, whither, ns Ruwdon snid, they had the good luck to go
in the truack of the conquering army.
To the rector's ldy, who went off to tend her husband's broken
collar-bone at the Ilectory at ueen's Crawley, the spinster's comuni-
cations were by no means so gracious. Mrs. Bute, that brisk, manag-
ing, lively, imperious womnn, had committed the most fatal of all errors
with regrd to her sister-in-law. She hnl not crely oppressed her and
her household-she had bored Miss Crawley : and if poor Miss Briggs
hal been a woman of any spirit, she might havc been made happy by
the comnmission which her principal gwve her, to write a letter to Mrs.
Bute Cruwlcy, sying thut Miss Crawley's health was gcatly improved
sinee Mrs. ute had lcft her, and begging the lulter on no account to pt
herself to trouble, or quit her fmily for Miss Crawley's sake. This
triumphi over a ldy who hal been very hauglty and cruel in her beha-
viour to Miss Briggs, woull have rejoicel most women; but the truth
is, Briggs was a woman of no spirit at nll, anl the moment her enemy
was discomfited she began to fcel compassion in her fnvour.
eeHIow silly I was,'' Mrs. lBute thought, nnd with reason, ``ever to
Iint that I was coming, as I did, in that foolish lettor when we sent Miss
Crawley tle guinea-fowls. I ought to have gone without n word to tle
poor lcnr doting old creature, nnd taken her out of the hands of th:at
niuny bBriggs, and that harny of a fene de elambre. Oh. Butc, Butc,
why did you break your collar-bone?''
Why, indeedP We have secn how Mrs. Bute, having the game in her
hands, hal really playedl her cards too well. She hal ruled over Miss
Crawley's household utterly and completely, to be utterly and completely
routed when n favouruable opportunity for rebellion came. She and her
household, however, considercd thnt she had been the victim of horrible
selfishness and trenson, and that her saecrifices in Miss Crnwley's hehalf
had met with the most saage ingratitude. Rawdon's promotion, and the
honourable mention mado of his nane in the Gazette, filled this gool
Christian lady also with alarm. Woull his aunt relent towarls him now

syllble of it. He had Pitt Crawley for one of his auditors-Pitt, who had
come with his two half-sisters, to church, which the old Baronet could now
by now menns be brought to frequeut.
Since the departure of Becky Sharp, that old wretch had given himself
up entirely to his bad courses, to the great scandal of the county and the
mute horror of his son. The ribbons in Miss Horrocks's cap became more
splendid than ever. The polite families fled the hll and its owner in
terror. Sir Pitt went about tippling at his tenants' houses; and drank
rum-and-water with the farmers at Mudbury and the neighbouring places
on market-days. He drove the family conch-and-four to Southampton
with Miss Horrocks inside: and the county people expected, every week,
as his son did in speechless agony, that his marnage with her would be
announced in the provincial paper. It was indeed a rude burthen for Mr.
Crawley to bear. His eloquence was palsied at the missioary meetings,
and other religious assemblies in the neighbourhood, where he had been in
tle habit of presiding, and of speaking for hours; for he felt, when he
rose, that the audience said, ``That is the son of the old reprobate Sir
Pitt, who is very likely drinking at the publia-house at this very moment.''
And once when he was speaking of the benighted condition of the king of
Timbuctoo, and the number of his wives who were likewise in darkness,
some tipsy miscrennt from tle orowd asked,  How many is tlere at
ueen's Crawley, oung quaretoesP'' to the surprise of the platform,
and the ruin of Mr. Pitt's speech. Md the two daughters of the honse
of ueen's Crawley would have been allowed to run utterly wild (for Sin
Pitt swore that no governess should ever entcr into his doors again), had
not Mr. Crawley, by threatening the old gentleman, forced the latter to
scnd them to school.
MIceanwhile, as we hae said, whatever individual differenees there might
be bctwcen them all, Miss Crawley's dear nephews nnd nieces were
unnnimous in loving her and sending her tokens of affection. Thus Mrs.
Bute sent guinea-fowls, and somc remnrknably fine cauliflowers, and a pretty
purse or pincushion workel by her darling girls, who begged to keep a
little place in the recollection of their dear aunt, while Mr. Pitt sent
peaclecs and grapes and venison irom the Hnll. Thce Southampton coach
used to cnarry these tokens of afection to Miss Crawley at Brighton : it
used somctimes to convey Mr. Pitt thither too : for his differences with Sir
Pitt causel Mr. Craley to absent limself a good deal from home now:
nd besides, he had an attraction at Brighton in the person of the Lady
Jane Sheepshanks whose engagement to Mr. Crawley has been formerly
mentioned in this listory. Her Ladyship and her sisters lived at Brighton
with their mamma, the Countess Southdown, that stroug-minded woman
so favourably known in the serious world.
A few words ought to be said regarding her Lalyship nd her noble
fuaily, who are bound by ties of present and future relationslip to the
house of Crawley. Respecting the clief of the Southdown family, Clement
William, fourth Enrl of Southdown, little need be told, exeept that his
Lordship came into Parliamcnt (as Lord WVolsey), under the auspices of
M. WilbUerforce, and for a time was a credit to is political sponsor, and
dcciledly a seious young man. But words cannot describe the feelings

of his admirable mother, when she learmned, ery shortly after her noble
husband's demise, that her son was a member of several worldly clubs, had
lost largely at play at Wattiers and the Cocoa ITree; that he hd raised
money on post-obits, and encumbered the family estate; that he droe
four-in-hand, and patronized the ring; and that he actually had an opera-
box, where he entertained the most dangerous bachelor company. His
name was only mentioned with groans in the dowager's circle.
The Lndy Emily was her brother's senior by many years; and took
considerable rank in the serious world as author of some of the delightful
traets before mentioned, and of many hymns and spiritual pieces. A
mature spinster, and having but faint ideas of marriage, her love for the
blacks occupied almost nll her feelings. It is to her, I believe, we owe
that beautiful poem,-
 Lead us to eome sunny iale,
Yonder in the western deep;
Where the skies for ever smile,
And the blacks for ever weep,'' &a
She hnd correspondences with elerical gentlemen in most of our
East and West India possessions; and was secretly attached to
the Reverend Silas Hornblower, who was tattooed in the South Sen
Islands.
As for the Lady Jane, on whom, as it has been said, Mr. Pitt
Crawley's affection had been placed, she was gentle, blushing, silent,
and timid. In spite of his falling away, she wept for her brother, and was
quite ashamed of loving him still. Even yet she used to send him little
hurried smuggled notes, and pop them in the post in privute. The one
lreadful seeret which weighed upon her life was, that she and the old
housekeeper had been to pay Southdown a furtive visit at his chambers in
the Albany; and found him-O the naughty dear abandoned wretchl
smoking a cigar with a bottle of Curacoa before him. She admired her
sister, she alored her motler, she thought Mr. Crawley the most delight-
ful and accomplished of men, after Southdown, that fallen angel: and her
mamma and sister, who were ladies of the most superior sort, managed
everything for her, and regarded her wvith that amiable pity, of which
your really superior woman always has such a share to give aay. Her
mamma ordered her dresses, her books, her bonnets, and her ideas for her.
She was made to take pony-riding, or pino-exercise, or any other sort of
bodily medicament, according as my lady Southdown saw meet; and her
ladyship would have kept her daughter in pinafores up to her preseent age
of six-and-twenty, but that they were tlrown off when Lady Jane was
presented to ueen Charlotte.
When these ladies first came to their house at Brighton, it was to them
alone that Mr. Crawley paid his personal visits, contenting himself by leaving
a card at his aunt's house, and making a modest inquiry of Mr, Bowls or his
assistant footman, with respect to the health of the inlid. When he met
Miss Briggs coming home from the library with a cargo aof novels under
her arm, Mr. Crawley blushed in a manner quite unusual to him, as he
stepped forward and shook Miss Crawley's companion by the hand. Hc

introduced Miss Briggs to the lady with whom he hasppened to be walking,

to you my aunt's kindest friend and most affectionate companion, Miss
Briggs, whom you know under another title, as authoress of the delightfal
`Lyrics of the Heart,' of which you are so fond.'' Lady Janeblushed too
as she held out a kind little hand to Miss Briggs, and said something very
civil and incoherent about mamma, and preposing to call on Miss Crawley,

Crawley; and with soft dove-like eyes saluted Miss bBriggs as they
separated, while Pitt Crawley treated her to a profound courtly bow, such

wlich he remembered to have seen at ueen's Crawley, with a dedication
from the poetess to his father's late wife; and he brought the volume with
him to lrighton, readiug it in the Southampton coacl, and marking it
with his own pencil, before he presented it to the gentle Lady June.
It was he, too, who laid before Lady Southdown the great advantageswhich
might occur from an intimney between her family and Miss Crauley,--
advantages oth worldly and spiritul, he said: for Miss Crawley was now
quite lone; the monstrous dissipation and alliance of his brother Rawdon,
had estrangel her afections fron that rcprobute young man; the grecdy
tyranny and avnrice of Mrs. Bute Crawley had caused the old lady to
revolt against the exorbitant pretensions of tht prt of the fuamily; and
though he hiself had hell off all his life from cultivating Miss Crawley's
friendship, with perhaps an improper pride, he thought now that every
becoming means should be taken, both to sne her soul from perdition, and
to secure lcr fortune to himself as the heuad of the house of Crawley.
The strong-mindel Lndy Southdown quite agreed in both proposals of
her son-in-luw, and was for converting Miss Crawley of hand. At ler
own home, both at Soutludown and at Trottermore Cnstle, this tall and
awful missionary of the truth rode about the country in her barouche with
outriders, launched packets of tracts among the cottagers nnd tennnts, and
woull orler Gaffer Jones to be converted, as she would order Goody HIicks
to take a James's powder, without appeal, resistunce, or benefit of clergy.
My Lord Southdown, her late husbnd, an epileptic and simple-minded
nobleman, was in the habit of approving of everything which his Matilda
lid and thought. So that whatever changes her own belief might undergo
(and it aeeomolated itself to a prodigious variety of opinion, taken from
all sorts of doctors among the Dissenters) shc had not the least scruple in
ordering all hcr tenants and inferiors to follow nnd believe after her. Thus
whether she received the Reverend Saunders McNitre the Scotch
livine; or thc lleverend Luke Waters the mild Wesleyan; or the Reverend
(iles Jowls the illuminated Cobbler who duhbed himself Reverend as
npoleon erowned himself Emperor-the louseholl, ehildren, tenantry
of my Lady Southdown were expected to go down on their knees with
her Ladyship, and sny Amen to the praycrs of either Doctor. During tlese
exercises old Southdown, on aceount of his invalid condition, was allowed
to sit in his own room, and ave negus and the paper read to him. Lady
Jane was the old Enrl's favourite daughter, and tended him and loved lim
sineerely: as for Lady Emily, the autloress of the  Waslerwoman of
Finchley Common,'' her denunciation of future punishments (nt this period,
for her opinions modified afterwards) wcre so awful that thcy used to
frighten the timid old gentleman her father, and the physicians declarel
his fits always occurred after one of her Ladyslip's sermons.

exhortation of her daughter's preendu, Mr. Pitt Crawley-' Who is

Mr. Crawley mentioned the namc of Mr. Crenmer.

nistered to him; but alasl it was too late. His death was delightful,
however; and his change was only for the better: Creamer, my dear Pitt,

Pitt expressed his perfeet aequicscence. He too had been carried along
by the energy of his noble kinswoman, and future mother-in-law. He
had been made to aceept Saunders McNitre, Luke Waters, Giles Jowls,
Poger's Pills, Rodger's Pills, Pokey's Elixir, every one of her Ladyship's
remedies spiritual or temporal. He never left her house without carrying
respectfully away with him piles of her quack thieology and medicine. O

does not know and suffer under such benevolent despotsP It is in vain
you say to them, ``Dear Madam, I took Podger's specific at your orders

she cannot conince by argument, bursts into tears, and the recusant finds
himself, at the end of the contest, taking down the bolus, and saying,

`Stop, my dear ladies,'' ssil Pitt the diplomatist,  With every deference
to the opinion of my beloved and respected Lady Southdown, I think it
would be quite unadvisable to commence so early upaon serious topics with
Miss Crawley. Remember her delicate condition, and how little, how sery
little aceustomed she has hitherto been to considerations connected with
her immortal welfare,''
`Can we then begin too early, Pitt%'' said Lady Emily, riasing with six
little books already in her hand.
 If you begin abruptly, you will frighten her altogether. I know my
aunt's worldly nature so well as to be sure that any abrupt attempt at
conversion will be the very worst means that can be employed for the
welfare of that unfortunate lady. Iou will only frighten and annoy her.
She will very likely fling the books away, and refuse all acquaintanee with
the givers.''
You are as worldly as MIiss Crawley, Pitt,'' aaid Lady Emily, tossig
out of the room, her books in her hand.

 Of course, of course,'' Lady Southdown remarked. ``Jane, my love,
you need not send that note to Mr. Irons. If her health is such that dis-
cussions fatigue her, we will wait her amendment. I will cull upon Miss
Crawley to-morrow,''
``And if I might suggest, my sweet laly,'' Pitt said in a bland tone,
`it would be as well not to take our precious Emily, who is too euthu-
siastic; but rather that you should be accompanied by our sweet and dear
Lady Jnne.''
``Most certaiuly, Emily would ruin everything,'' Lady Southdown snid;
and this time agreed to forego her usual practice, which was, as we have
said, before she bore down personally upon any individual whom she pro-
posed to subjugate, to fire in a quantity of tracts upon the menaced party;
(as a charge of the French was always preceded by n furious cannonale).
Lady Soutldown, we say, for the sake of the invalid's health, or for the
sake of ler soul's ultimate welfare, or for the sake of her money, agreed to
temporise.
The next day the great Southdown female family carriage, with the
Earl's coronet and the lozenge (upon which the three lambs trottant
argent upon the field ert of the Southdowns, were quartered with sable

Binkie), drove up in state to Miss Crawley's door, and the tall serious foot-
man handed in to Mr. Bowls her Ladyship's cards for Miss Crawley, and
one likoewise for Miss Briggs. By way of compromise, Lady Emily sent in
a packet in the evening for the latter lady, containing copies of the
: Washerwoman,'' nnd other mild and favourite tracts for Miss B.'s own
perusal; and a few for the serants' hall, viz. : `'Crubs from the Pantry;''
The Frying Pan and the Fire,'' and  The Livery of Sin,'' of a much

to speak a good word for the

Southdown family had been pre-
sented to Miss Crawley. A

little pleasing to the poor friend-

a card upon yo, I wonder, Mfiss Briggs ?'' said the republicun Miss
Crawley ; upon which thc companion meekly said ``that she hoped
there could be no harm in a lady of runk taking notice of a poor
gentlewoman,'' and she put away this card in her work-box amongst her
mest cherished personal trensures. Furthermore, Miss Briggs cxplained
how shc had met Mr. Crawley walking with lis cousin and long-affianeed
brile the day boefore: and she told how kind and gentle-looking the lady
wvas, and what a plain, not to say common, dress she had, all the articles
of which, from the bonnet down to the boots, she described and estimated
with female accuracy.
Miss Crawley allowel Briggs to prattle on without interrupting her toa
much. As she got well, she was pining for society. Mr. Creamer, her
edical man, would not hear of her returning to her old haunts and dissipa-
tion in London. The old spinster was too glad to find any companionslin
at Briglton, and not only were the cards acknowledged the very next day,
but itt Crawley ws graciously invited to come and see his aunt. He
came, bringing with him Lady Southdown and her daughter. The dowager
lid not say n word about the state of Miss Crawley's soul; but talked
with much discretion about the weather: about the war and the dowhnfall
of the monster Bonnparte: and above all, about doctors, quacks, and the
particular merits of Dr. Podgers, wlom she then patronised.
During thcir interview Pitt Crawley made a greut stroke, anl one which
showel that, had his diplomatic creer not been blighted by erly negleet,
he might have risen to a high rank in his profession. When the Countess
Dowager of Southdown fell foul of the Corsican upstart, as the fashion
was in those days, and showed that he was a monster stained with eery

conceivable crime, a coward mnd a tyrant not fit to live, one whose fall was
predicted, &c., Pitt Crawley suddenly took up the cudgels in favour of thc
an of Destiny. le described the First Consul as he saw him at Taris
at the Peace of Amiens; when he, Pitt Crawley, had the gratification of
making the acquaintanee of the great and good Mr. Fox, a statesan
whom, however much he might differ with him, it was ipossible not to
admire fervently-a statesman who had always had the highest opinion
of the lEmperor Napoleon. And he spoke in terms of the strongest
indignation of the fuaitlless conduct of the allies towarls tlis dethroned
monarch, who, after giving himsclf generously up to their mercy, as
consigned to an ignoble and cruel banishment, while a bigotted opisl
rabble was tyrannising over France in his stead.
This orthodox horror of Romish superstition saved Pitt Crawley in Lady
Southdown's opinion, whilst his admiration for ox and Napoleon raised
him immeasurably in Miss Crawley's eyes. Her friendship with that
defunct British statesmnn was mentioned when we first introduced her in
tlis history. A true Whig, Miss Crawley had been in opposition all
through the war, aud though, to be sure, the downfall of the Emperor did
not very much agitate the old lady, or his ill-treatment tenl to shorten
her life or natural rest, yet Pitt spoke to her heart when he lauded both
her idols; and by that single speech made immense progress in her favour.
`And what do you tlink, my dear'' Miss Crawley snid to the young
lady, for wlom she had taken a liking at first sight, as she always lid for
pretty and modest young people; though it must be owned her affcctions
cooled as rapidly as they rose.
Lady Jane blushed very much, and said ``that she dil not understand
politics, which she left to wiser heads than cr's; but though Mamma was,
no doubt, correet, Mr. Crawley hal spoken beautifully.'' And wlen the
ladies were retiring at the conclusion of their visit, Miss Crawley hoped
` Lady Southdown would be so kind as to send her Lndy Jane somctimes, if
she could be spared to come down and console a poor sick lonely old
woman.'' This promise was graciously aecorded, and they separated upon
great termns of amity.
`Don't let Lady Southdown come again, Pitt,'' said the old lady.  She
is stupid and pompous like all your mother's family, whom I never could
endure. But bring that nice good-aturcd little Ludy lane as often as ever
you plese.'' Pitt promised that he would do so. He did not tell the
Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladysip,
who, on the contrary, thought that she had mude a most delightful and
majestic impression on Miss Crawley.
And so, nothing loth to comfort n sick lady, and perlaps not sorry in
her heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the
Reverend Bartholomew Irons, and the serious tondies who gathered round
the footstool of the pompous Countess, her mamm, Lady Jane became a
pretty constant visitor to Miss Crawley, accompanied her in her drives, and
solaced many of her evenings. She was so naturally good and soft, that
even Firkin was not jealous of her; and the gentle Briggs thought her
friend was less cruel to her, when kind Lady Jane was by, Towards her

Ladyship Miss Crawley's mnnners were charming. The old spinster told her
a thousand anecdotes about her outh, talking to her in a very dilferent
strain from that in which she had been accustomed to converse with the
godless little Rebecca; for there was that in Lady Jane's innocence which
rendered light talking impertinence before her, and Miss Crawley was too
much of a gentlewoman to offend such purity. The young lady herself
had never received kindness except from this old spinster, and her brolher
and futher : and she repaid Miss Crawley's engoient by artless sweetness
anl frienlship.
In the autumn evenings (when Rebecca was flannting at Paris, the
gayest among the gay conquerors there, and our Amelia, our dear wounded
Amelia, ahl where was sle ) Lady Jane would be sitting in Miss Crawley's
drawing-room singing sweetly to her, in the twilight, her little simple
songs and hymns, while the sun was setting and the sea was ronring on
the beach. The old spinster used to wake up when these ditties ceased,
and ask for more. As for Briggs, and the quntity of tears of happiness
which she now shed as she pretended to knit, and looked out at the
splendid ocean darkling before the windows, and the lamps of heaven
beginning more brightly to shine-who, I say, can measure the happiness
and sensibility of Briggs'
Pitt meanwhile in the dining-room, with a pamphlet of the Corn Laws
or a Missionary Register by his side, took that kind of reereation which
suits romantie and unromantic men after dinner. He sipt Madeira : built
castles in the air: thought himself a fine fellow : felt himself much more
in love with Jane than he had been any time these seven years, during
which their liaison had lastel without the slightest impatience on Pitt's
part-and slept a good deal. When the time for coffee came, Mr. Bowls
used to enter iu a noisy manner, and summon Squire Pitt, who would be
found in the dark very busy with his pamphlet.
I wish, my love, I could get somebody to play picquet with me,''
Miss Crawley said, one night, when this functionnry made his appearanee
with the candkes and the coffee. `Poor Briggs can no more play than an
owl, she is so stupid'' (the spinster always took an opportunity of absing
Briggs before the servants) ; ``and I think I should sleep better if I had
my game.''
At this Lady Jane blushed to the tips of her little ears, und down to the
ends of her pretty fingers; and when Mr. Bowls had quitted the room,
and the door was quite shut, she said:
Miss Crawley, I can play a little. I used to-to play a little with
poor dear papa.''
Come and kiss me. Come and kiss me this instant, you dear good
little soul,'' eried Mis Crawley in an ecstacy; and in this picturesque and
friendly oeeupation Mr. Pitt found the old Iady and the young one, when
he came up-stairs with his pamphlet in his hand. How she did blush all
the evening, that poor Lady Janel

shire and Sussex lie very close together, and Mrs. Bute had friends in the
latter county who took care to inform her of all, and a great deal more
than all, that passed ut Miss Crawley's house at Brighton. Pitt was there
more and more. He did not come for months together to the Inll, where
his abominable old father abandoned himself completely to rum and water,
anl the odious society of the Horrocks family. Pitt's success renderel
the Rector's family furious, and Mrs. Bute regretted more (though she
confessed less) than ever her monatrous fault iu so insulting Miss bBriggs,
nnd in being so haughty and parsimonious to Bowls and Firkin, that
she had not a single person left in Miss Crawley's household to give her
information of what took place there.  It was nll Bute's eollar-bone,''
she persisted in snying; '` if that hnd not broke, I never would have left
her. I am a martyr to duty and to your odious unelerical labit of

``Jim might go down and see her, certainly,'' the housewife snid;
ndling, with a sigh, `` If we could but get one of the girls into the house;
but she could never endure them, bceause they are not pretty.'' Those
unfortunate and well-educated women made themselves heard from the
neighbouring drawing-room, where they were thrumming awuy, with hard
fingers, an elaborate music-piece on the piano-forte, as their mother spoke;
and indeed they were at musie, or at backboard, or at geography, or at
history, the whole day long. But what avail all these accomplishments, in

her hands; and Jim coming in from the stable at this minute, through
the parlour window, with a short pipe stuck in his oil-skin cap, he and his
father fell to talking about odds on the St. Leger, and the colloquy between
the Rector and his wife ended.
Mrs. Bute did not argue much good to the cause from the sending of
her son James as an ambussalexr, und saw him depart in rnther a despairing
mood. Nor did the youug feuow himself, when told what his mission was
to be, expect mueh plensure or benefit from it; but le was consoled by
the thought that possibly tho oll lady would give him some handsome
remembrance of her, which would pay a few of his most pressing bills nt
the commencement of the esuing Oxford term, and so took his place by
the conch from Southampton, and was safely lanled at Brighton on the same
evening, with his portmanteau, his faourite bull-dog Towzer, and an
immense basket of farm and garden produce, from the denr lectory folks
to the dear Miss Crawley. Considering it was too late to disturb the
iuvalid lady on the first night of his arrival, he put up at an inn, and
lid not wait upon Miss Crawley until a late hour in the noon of next day.
James Crawley, when his aunt had Inst behell him, wsas a gawky lnad, at
that uncomfortable age when the voice varics between an uncnrthly trehle
anda preternatural base; when the face not uncommonly hlooms out with
appearances for which Rowlnand's Kalydor is said to nct ns a cure; when
boys are seen to shave furtiely with their sister's scissors, and the sight
of other young women produces intolerable sensntions of terror in them;
when the great hands and ankles protrude a long way from garments which
have grown too tight for them; when their presenee after dinnier is at onee
frightful to the ladies, who are whispering iu the twilight in the drawing-
room, und inexpressibly odious to the gentlemen over the mahogany, who
nre restrined fromu freedom of intercourse nnd delightful interchange of
wit by the presence of that gawky innocenee; when, at the conclusion of
the second glass, papas say, ``lack, my boy, go out and see if the evening
holds up,'' and the youth, willing to be free, yet hurt at not being yet a
man, quits the incomplete bnnquet. James, then a hobbadehoy, was now
become a young man, having had the benefits of a university education,
nnd aequired the inestimable polish, which is gained by living in a fast set
at a small college, and contracting debts, und being rusticated, and being
plucked.
He was  handsome lad, however, when he cnme to present limself to
his aunt at Brighton, and good looks were always a title to the fekle old
lady's fuvour. Nor did his blushes and awkwardness take away from it:
she was pleased with these healthy tokens of the young gentleman's
ingenuousness.
He said `he hal come down for a couple of days to see a man of his
college, and-and to pay my respects to you, M'am, and my father's and
mother's, who hope you are well.''
Pitt was in the room with Miss Crawley when the lad was announced,
and looked very blank when his ne was mentioned. The old lady had
plenty of humour, and enjoyed her correct nephew's perplexity. She
nsked after all the people at the Rectory with great interest ; and said she
was thinking of paying them a visit. She pruised the lad to his faee, and

his sisters had not some of his good looks; nnd finding, on inquiry, that
he had taken up his quarters at an hotel, would not henr of his stopping
there, but bnle Mr. Bowls senl for Mr. James Crawley's tlings instuutly;
``and hark ye, Bowls,'' she adled, with great grciousness, ``you will
have the goodness to pay Mr. James's bill.''
She flung Pitt a look of arch triumph, which caused that diplomntist
almost to choke with envy. Much ns he had ingratiated himself with lis
aunt, she had never yet invited him to stay under her roof, and here wns
a youug whipper-snapper, who at first sight wns made welcome there.

bow; ``what otel, Sir, shall Thomas fetch the lugguge from P''

Miss Craswley burst out laughing at tis title. Mr. Bowls gare one
nbrupt guffaw, as a conlilential servant of the family, but choked the rest
of the volley; the diplomntist only smiled.
I-I diln't know any better,'' snid James, looking down.  I'venever

teller1 The fact is, that on the Southampton coach, the dny previous,
James Crawley had met the Tutbury Pet, who was coming to Brighton to
make a mntch with the Rottingdean Fibber; and enchantel by the et's
conversation, had passed the evening in company with that scientific man
anl his friends, at the inn in question.
I-I'd best go and settle the score,'' James continued. "Couldi'I
think of asking you, Ma'am,'' he alded, generously.
This delicacy made his sunt laugh the more.
Go and settle the bill, Bowls,'' she said, with a wave of her hand,
` and bring it to me,''
Poor lndy, she did not know what she had donel eThere-there'ssa

He bites footmen's calves.''
All the party cried out with laughing at this deseription; even Briggs
and Lady Jane, who wns sitting mute during the interview between Miss
Crawley and her nephew; and Bowls, without a word, quitted the room.
Still, by way of punishing her elder nephew, Miss Crawley persisted in
being gracious to the young Oxonian. There were no limits to her kind-
ness or her compliments when they once began. She told Pitt he might
come to dinner, and insisted that James should accompany her in her drive,
and paraded him solemnly up and down the clif, on the baek seat of the
barouche. During all this exeursion, she condescended to say civil tlings
to lim: she quoted Italin and French poetry to the poor bewilderel
lad, and persisted that he wus a fine scholar, and was perfectly sure h
would guin a gold medal, and be a Senior Wrangler.
: Haw, haw,'' lsughed James, encouraged by thcese compliments,;
 Senior Wrangler, indeed; that 's at the other shop.''

dressel in white flannel coats, with mother-of-pearl buttons, his friends
the Tutbury Pet and the Rottinglean Fibber, with three other gentlemen
of their aequaintance, who all saluted poor James there in the carriage as
he sate. This incident damped the ingenuous youth's spirits, and no word
of yea or nay could he be induced to utter during the rest of the drive.
On his return he found his room prepared, and his portmanteau ready,
and might have remarked that MIr, Bowls's countenanee, when the latter
conducted him to his apartment, wore a look of graity, wonder, anl
compassion. But the thought of Mr. Bowls did not enter lis head. He
was deploring the dreadful predicament in which he found himself, in a
house full of old women, jabbering French and Italian, aul talking peetry
to him. ` Reglarly up a tree, by jingol'' exclaimel the molest boy, who
could not face the gentlest of her sex-not even Briggs-when she began
to tulk to him ; whereas, put him at Iffley Lock, and le could out-slang
the boldest bargeman.
At dinuer, James appenred choking in a white neckcloth, and had the
honour of hanling my Lady Jane down stairs, wlile Briggs and Mr.
Crawlcy followed afterwards, conducting the old lady, with her apparatus
of bundles, and shawls, aud cushions. Half of Briggs's tie at dinne
was spent in supcrintending the invalid's comfort, and in cutting up
chicken for her fat spaniel. James didnot talk much, but le ade a point
of asking all the ladies to drink wine, and accepted MIr. Crawley's chal-
lenge, anud consumed the greater part of a bottle of champagne which Mr,
Bowls was ordered to produce in his honour. The ladies having with-
lrawn, and the two cousins eing left together, Pitt, the ex-diplomatist,
became very communicative and friendly. He asked after James's career
at college-what his prospects in life were-hopel heartily he would get
on: nnd, in a word, was frank and amiable. James's tongue unloosed
with the Port, and he told lis cousin his life, his prospects, his debts, his
troubles at tle little-go, nnd his rows with the proctors, filling rapidly
from the bottles before hin, and flying from Port to Mndeira with joyous
activity.
 The chief plcasure wlich my auut has,'' said Mr. Crawley, flling his
glass, ``is that people should do as they like in her house. This is Liberty
HInll, James, and you can't do Miss Crawley a greater kindness tlan to do

me in the country for being n ory. Miss Crawley is liheral enough to
suit auy faney. She is a Republican in princiyple, and despises everything
like rank or title.''
Why are you going to marry an Earl's daughter ?'' said James.
My denr friend, remember it is not poor Lady Jane's fault that she is
well born,'' Pitt replied with a coutly air.  She canuot help being a
laty. Besides, I am a Tory, you know.''

absurdity,-'` yo don't care about a dawg or a rat; it's all onsense.

No; by the way,'' Pitt continued with inereased blaniness, ``it was

derive from patrician birth. Here's the fresh bottle.''

at Oxford, the men passed round the bottle a little quicker than you youg
fellows seem to do.''
``Come, come,'' said James, putting his hand to his nose nl winking
at lis cousin with a pair of vinous eyes, `` no jokes, old boy; no trying it
ou on me. ou want to trot me out, but it'sno go. In vino veritas, old
boy. MIars, Bacchus, Apollo virorum, hny? I wish my aunt would send

At the lectory, when the bottle of port wine was opened after dinner, the
young ladies had each a glass from a bottle of currant wine. Mrs. Bute
took one glass of port, honest James had a couple commonly, but as his
fatler grew vcry sulky if e made further inroads on the bottle, thce good
lad generally refrained from trying for more, and subsiled either into the
currant wine, or to some private gin-and-wuter in the stablcs, which hc
enjoyed in the company of the coachmau and his pipe. At Oxford, thc

could appreciate them indeed; and lardly needed any of his cousin's
encouragement in draining of the second bottle supplied by MIr. Bowls.
When the time for coflee came, however, and for a return to the ladies,
of whom he stood in awe, the young gentleman's agreecable frankness left
him, and he relapsed into his usual surly timidity: contenting himself by
saying yes and no, by scowling at ILady Jane, and by upsetting one cup of
coffee during the evening.
If he did not speak he yawned in a pitiable manner, and his presence
threw a damp upon the modest proceedings of the evening, for Miss
Crawley and Lady Jane at their piquet, and Miss Briggs at hcr work, felt
that his eyes were wildly fixed on thenr, and were uneasy under that
audlin look.
He seemns a very silent, awkward, bashful lad,'' said Miss Crawley to
Mr. Pitt.
He is more cormunicative in men's society than witl ldies,'' Machia-
vel dryly replied: perhaps ratler disappointed that the port wine had not
made lJin speak more.,
IIe had spent the early part of the next morning in writing homc to
his mother a ost flourishing account of his reception by Miss Crawley.
But ahl he little knew what evils the day was bringing for him, and how
short his reigu of favour was destined to be. A cireumstaneo which Jim
had forgotten-a trivial but fatal circumstanee-had taken place at thc
Cribb's Ars on the night before le hal come to his aunt's house. It
was no otler than this-Jim, who was nlways of a generous disposition,
aund when in his cups especially hospitable, had in the course of the night
treated the Tutbury champion and the Roltingdean man, and tleir friends,
twice or thrice to the refreslment of gin-and-water-eo that no less than
cightcen glasses of that fluid at eight-pence per glass were charged in
MIr. Jnmes Crawley's bill. It was not the amount of eight-pences, but
the quantity of gin wlich told fatally against poor James's character, when
his aunt's butler, Mr. Bowls, went down at his mistress's request to pay
the young gentleman's bill. The landlord, fearing lest the nceount should
be refused altogether, swore solemnly that the young gent had consumcd
personally every farthing's worth of the liquor: and Bowls paid the bill
finally, and showed it on his return hone to MIrs. Firkin, who was
slocked at the frightful prodigality of gin; and took the bill to Miss
Briggs as accountant-general; who thought it her duty to meution the
circumstanee to her principal, Miss Crawley.
HIad he drunk a dozen bottles of claret the old spinster could hare
pardoned him. Mr. Fox and MIr. Sheridan drank claret. Gentlemen
drank claret. But eighteen glasses of gin cousumed among boxers in an
ignoble pot-house-it was an odious crime and not to be pardoned readily.
Everything went against the lad: e came home pertumed from the
stubles, whither he had been to pay lis dog Towzer a visit-and whence
he was going to take his friend out for an airing, when le met Miss Crawley
and her wheezy Blenheim spanicl, which Towzer would have eaten up
ld not the Blenleim fled squealing to the protectiou of Miss Briggs,
while tle atrocious master of the bull-dog stood laugliug at the horrible
persecution.

A NOYEL WIOUT A HERO.

This day too the unlucky oy's modesty had likewise forsaken himn.
IIe wus lively and faecetious at diuuer. During the repast he lcvellel one
or two jokes against Pitt Crnwley: he drank as much wine as upon the
previous day : and going quite unsuspiciously to thc drawing-room began
to entertain the ladies there with some choice Oxsford stories. IIe deseribed
the different pugilistie qulities of Molyneus anl Dutch Sam, offered
playfully to give Lndy Jane the odls upon the Tutbury Pet against the
Rottingdean man, or take them, ns her Lalyship chose: and crowned thc
plecnsntry by proposing to back himself against his cousin Pitt Crawley,
either with or without tle gloves. `And that 's an fair offer, my buck,'' he
said, with a loud laugh, slapping Pitt on thce shoulder, ``and my father
told me to make it too, nnd he'll go hlves in the bet, ha hal'' Sa
saying, the engaging youth nodded knowingly at poor MIiss Briggs, and
pointed his thumb over his shoulder at IPitt Crawley in a jocular and
exulting manner.
Pitt was not pleased altogether pcrhaps, but still nol unhappy in th
ain. Poor Jim had his laugh out : and staggerel neross the room witl
his aunt's candlc, when the old lady moved to retire, and oflerei to salut.
1er with the blandest tipsy smile: :nd he took his own lcave and went up-
stairs to his bel-room perfectly satisfied with hiself, and with a pleased
otion that his atnt's money would be left to him in preference to hie
father and all the rest of his fmily.
Once up in the bet-room, one wonld havc tlouht he could not make
mnatters worse; and yet this tnlucky boydid. ho manon was shining

blowing inwards and a fiue thorough draft being esthlished, the clouds of
tobacco were carried down-stairs, and arriscd with quite undiminished
iragrance to Miss Crawlcy and Miss lriggs.
That pipe of tobacco finished the business: nnd the Bute-Crawleys
ncver knew how many thousnnd ponnd it cost them. Firkin rushed dowvn-
stairs to Bowls who was reading out the `` Fire and tle Frying Pan'' to
his aide-de-camp in a loud and ghostly voice. The dreadful secret was
told to him by Firkin with so frightened a look, thst for the first moment
Mr. Bowls and his young man tlought that fblbers were in the house
the legs of whom had probbly been diseovered by the woman under MIiss
Crawley's bed. When made aware of the fact however-to rush up-stairs
nt three steps at a time-to enter the unconscious James's apartment,
calling out,  MIr. James,'' in n voice stiflel with alarm, and to cry ' For
Gawl's sake, Sir, stop that 'are pipe,'' was the work of a minute with
MIr. Bowls. :O, Mr. James, what 'are you lone,'' he snid in a voice of
the deepest pathos, ns he threw the implement out of the window. e Wlat

beard which he was so anxiouly expeeting, handed a note into Mr. James
in bed, in the handwriting of Miss Briggs.
` Dear Sir,'' it said, `` Miss Crawley has psssed an exceelingly dia
turbed night, owing to the shoeking manner in which the house has been
polluted by tobacco; Miss Crawley bids me say she regrets that she is too
unwell to see you before you go-and above all, that she ever induced yon
to remove from the ale-house, where she is sure you will be much more
eomfortable during the rest of your stay at Brighton.''
And herewith honest James's career as a candidate for his aunt's faour
ended. He Iad in fact, and without knowing it, done what he menaeed
to do. He hal fought his cousin Pitt with the gloves.

after Waterloo, and were passing the winter of 1815 at Paris in great
splendour and gaiety. Rebecen was a good economist, and the price
poor Jos Sedley had paid for her two horses was in itself sufficient to
keep their little establishment afloat for a year, at the least; there was no
occasion to turn into money `` my pistols, the sme wlich I shot Cnptain
Mnrker,'' or the gold dressing-case, or the cloak lined with snble. Becky
had it made into a pelisse for eraelf, in which she rode in the Bois de

between her and hcr delighted husband, whom she rejoinel after the army
had entered Cnmbray, and when she unsewed herself, and let out of her dress

she hnd secreted in the wudding, previous to hcr editated flight from

lanughter, and swore that she was better thnn any play he eer suw, by

with infinite fur, carried up his delight to a pitch of quite insane enthu-
siasm. He believed in his wife as much as the Frencl soldiers ins

their grace, their liveliness, their manner. Her husband was stupid cer-
tainly-all English are stupid-and, besides, a dull husband at Paris is
always a point in a lady's favour. He was the heir of the rich and
spiritelle Miss Crawley, whose honse had been open to so many of the
French noblesse during the emigration. They received the Colonel's wife

If you could have seen the spite of a certain stupid Milali Bnreacres,
(whose eagle-beak and toque and feathers may be seen peering over the
heads of all assemblies) when Madame, the Duchess of AngoulEme, the
nugust daughter and companion of kings, desired especially to be presented
to Mrs. Crawley, as your dear daughter and protee, and thanked her in the
name of Frannce, for all your benevolence towrds our unfortunntes during

any means advunce Mre. Beeky's interest with her admirable, her respect-

ciously she had mde use of Miss Crawley's name, to get an entrce into
Parisian society. Too much slaken iu mind and body to compose a lctter
in tle Frcnch lguage in reply to that of her correspondent, she dictated
to Briggs a furious answer in her own natie tongue, repudiating Mrs.
Rawdon Crawlcy altogether, and waruing the public to beware of her as
a most artful and dangerous person. But as adame the Duchess of
N- had ouly been twenty years in England, she did not understanda
single word of the languaoge, and contented lcrself by informing Mrs.
Rawlon Crawley at their next meeting, that she had received a charing
letter from that clre lIees, and tlat it was full of beneolent thiugs for
MIrs. Crawley, wlho began seriously to hae hopes that the spinster would
relent.
Meanwhile, she was the gayest and most admired of Englishwomen: and
had a little European congress on her reeeption-night-Prussians and Cos-
sacks, ipaniarls and English-all the world was at Paris during this famous
wiuter: to lace seen the stars and cordons in Rebecca's humble saloon
woull hae made nll Baker Strcet pale with envy. Famous warriors rode

there were parties every duay at Vdry's or Beauillicrs'; play was plentiful
and his luck good. Tufto perhaps was sulky. MIrs. Tufto huid come
over to Pnris at her own invitation, and besides this conteteps, there
were a score of geuerals now rounl Becky's chair, and she miglt take her
choice of a dozen bouquets wen she went to the play. Lndy Bareacres
and the chiefs of the English society, stupid and irreproachable females,
writhed with anguish at the suceess of the little upstart Beeky, whose
poisoned jokes quivered and rankled in thcir chaste breasts. But she had
all the mcn on ler side. Sle fought tle women with indomitable courage,
and they could not talk scandal in any tongue but their own.
So in feites, pleasures, and prosperity, the winter of 1815-10 passed
away with MIrs. Rawdon Crawley, who accommodated herself to polite life
ns if her ancestors had been people of fnshion for centuries past-and
who from her wit, talent, and energy, indeed merited a place of houour
in Vanity Fuir. In the early spring of 1816, Galignani's Journal con-
tained the following anouncement in an interesting corner of the paper:
On the 26th of MInrch-the Laly of Lieutenant-Colonel Orawley, of the
Life Guards Green-of a son and heir,''
This event was copicd into the London papers, out of whieh Miss
Briggs read the statement to Mliss Crawley, at breakfast, at Brighton.
The intelligence, expeectedl as it might have been, caused a crisis in the
affairs of the Crawley family. The spinster's rage ose to its height,
and sending instantly for Pitt, her nephew, and for the Lody Southdown,
from Brunswick Square, she requested an immediate celebration of the
marriage which had been so long pending between the two families.
And she announced that it was her intention to allow the young eouple a
thousand a year during her lifetime, at the expiration of which the bulk
of her property would be scttled upon her nephew and her der niece,
Lady Iane Crawley. Waxy came down to ratify the deeds-Lord

therefore, anl lived witl Miss Crawley: and (greatly to the anuoyance of
poor Pitt, who conceived himself a most injured chlaracter-being subject
to the humours of his aunt on one side and of his mother-in-law on thc
other,) Lady Southdown, from ler neighbouring house, rcigued over the
whole family-Pitt, Lady Jue, Miss Craley, riggs, Bowls, Firkin, nnd
all. Shc pitilessly dosed them witl her tracts and her medicine: she
dismissed Creamer, she installed Iodgers, and soon stripped Miss Crawley
of even the semblance of authority. The poor soul grew so timil that
she actually left of bullying Briggs any more, and clung to her niece,
more fond and more terrified every day. Pence to thce, kiud and selfish,
vain and generous old henthen I-We shall see thee no more. Let us
hope that Lndy Jane supported her kinly, and led her with gentle hnnd
out of the busy struggle of Vanity Fuir.

HE news of the great fights ol
uatre Bras and Waterloo
reached England at the same
time. The Gazette first pub-
lished the result of the twa
battles; at which glorious in-
telligence all England thrilled
with triumph and fear. Par-
ticulars then followed; and
anfter the announcement of the
victories came the list of the
wounded and the slain. Who
can tell the drcad with which
that cutalogue was opened and
rend. Fancy, at eery village
and homestead almost tlrough
the three kingdoms, the great
news coming of the battles of
Flanders, and the feelings of exultation and gratitude, bereavement and
sickenin;g dismny, when the lists of the regimcntal losses were gone
through, and it became know whether the dear friend and relative
had escaped or had fallen. Anybody who will take the trouble of
looking back to a file of the newspapers of the time, must, even now,
feel at second-hand this breathless pause of expectation. The list of
casualties are carried on from day to day: you stop in the midst as in n
story wichl is to bc continued in our next. Think wvhat the feelings must
have been as those papers followed cnch other fresh from the press; and if
such an interest could be felt in our country, and about a battle where but
twenty tlousand of our people wecre engaged, think of the condition ol
Europe for twenty years before, where people were fighting, not by thou-
sands, but by millions; each one of whom as e struck his enemy wounded
horribly some other innocent heart far away.
The news which that famous Gazette brought to the Osbornes gare a
dreadful shock to the family und its chief. The girls indulged unrestrained
in their grief. The gloom-stricken old father was still more borne down
by his fate and sorrow. He strove to think that a judgment was on the
boy for his disobedience. He dured not own that the severity of the
sentence frightcned him, and that its fulfilment had come too soon upon
his curses. Sometimes a shuddering terror struck him, as if he had been
the anthor of the doom which he had cnllcd down on his son. There was

n chance before of reconciliation. The boy's wife might have diel; or he
might have come back and sni, Father I have sinned. But tlere wns no
hope now. He stood on the other side of the gulf impassable, haunting
lis parent with sad eyes. He remembered them once before so in a feer,
when every one thought the lad was dying, and e lay on his bed spcech-
less, and gazing with a dreadful gloom. Gdood Godl how the father clung
to the doctor then; and with what n sickening anxiety he followed him:
wvhat a weight of grief was off his mind when, after the crisis of the feer,
the lad recovered, and looked nt lis father once more with eyes that recog-
nized him. But now there was no help or cure, or chance of reconcile-
ment: nbove all, there were no humble words to soothce vanity outraged
and furious, or bring to its natural flow the poisoned, angry blood. And
it is hard to say which pang it was tore the proud father's heart most
keenly-that his son should hnve gone out of the rench of his forgive-
ness, or that the apology which his own pride expected should hnve
eseaped him.
WFhatever his sensations might have been, however, the stcrn old man
would have no confidant. He nevcr mentioned his son's name to his
dughters ; but ordered the elder to place all the females of the cstablisl-
ment in mourning; and desired thant the male servants should be similarly
anttired in deep black. All parties and entertainments, of course, were to
be put off. No eommunications were made to his future son-in-law, whose
marriage-day had been fixel; but there was enoughl in MIr. Osborne's
appearance to prevent Mr. Bullock from making any inquiries, or in any
way pressing forward that ceremony. IIe and the ladies whispered about
it under their voices in the drawing-room sometimes, whither the fnther
never came. He remained constantly in his own study; the whole front
part of the housc being closed until some time after the completion of the
general mourning.
About three weeks nfter the 18th of June, Mr. Osborne's acquaintanee,
Sir William Dobbin, clled at Mr. Osborne's house in Russell squre, with
a very pale and agitated face, and insisted upon seeing that gentleman.
Ushered into his room, and after a few words, whlich neither the speaker
nor the host understood, the former produeed from an inclosure a lettet
sealed with a large red seal.  My son, Mnjor Dobbin,'' the Alderman
said, with some hesitation, `` dispatched me a letter by an officer of the
--th, who anrrived in town to-dny. My son's lcetter contains one for you,
Osborne.'' The Alderman placed the letter on the table, and Osborne
stared at him for a moment or two in silenee. His looks frightened the
ambassador, who, after looking guiltily for a little time at the grief-stricken
man, hurriel away without a farther word.
The letter was in George's well-known bold hnnd-writing. It was that
one which he had written before day-break on the 16th of June, anl just
efore he took leae of Amelia. The great red seal was emblazoned with
the sham coat of arms which Osborne had assumed from the Peerage, with
Pax in bello'' for a motto; that of the ducal house with which the vain
old man tried to fancy himself connected. The hand thnt signed it would
nerer hold pen or sword more. The ery seal that sealed it had been
robbed from George's dead body as it lay on the field of battle. The

What dark, cruel comments upon Life and Vanitiesl Most of us have

The poor boy's letter did not say much. He had heen too proud to
neknowledge the tenderncss which his heart felt. He only said, that on
the eve of a great buttle, e wishel to bid his father farewell, and solemuly
to implore his good offices for the wife-it might be for tle child-whom
he 1eft behind him. He owned with contrition that his irregularities and
extravagance had already wnsted a large part of his mother's little fortune.
He thanked lis futher for his formcr generous conduct; and he promised
him, thnt if he fell on the field or survived it, he would act in a manner
worthy of the name of George Osborne.
IIis English habit, pride, awkwardness perhaps, had preventel him
from saying more. Iis father could not see the kiss George had placed on
the superscription of his letter. MIr. Osborne dropped it with the bitterest,
lcndliest pnng of balked affection and revenge. His son was still beloved
nnd unforgiven.
About two months afterwards however, as the young ladies of the
family went to church with their father, they remarked how he took a
lifferent seat from that which he usually occupied when he chose to
attend divine worship; and thut from his cushion opposite, he looked up
at the wall over their heads. This caused the young women likewise
to guze in the direction towards which the father's gloomy eyes pointed:
and they saw an elaborate monument upon the wall, where Britannia was
represented weeping over an urn, nd a broken sword, and a couchant
lion, indicated that the piece of sculpture had been erected in honour of a
leceased warrior. The sculntors of those days had stocks of such funerenl
emblems in hand; as you may see still on the walls of St. Paul's, which
are covered with hundreds of these braggart heathen allegories. There
was a constant demand for them during the first fifteen years of the
present century.
Under the memorial in question were emblazoned the well known and
pompous Osborne arms; and the inscription said, that the monument was
Sacred to the memory of George Oborne, Junior, sq., late a Captain

The siglt of that stone agitated the nerves of the sisters so much, that
Miss Maria was compelled to leave the church. The congregation made

the son and fathcr caused by the former's arriage, s to the chance ol a
reconciliation withl the young widow. There were bcts aong the
gentlemen both about Russell Square and in the City.
If the sisters had any anxiety regarding the possible recoguition of
Amelia as a duughter of the family, it was increased presently, and towards
the enl of the autumn, by their fatler's announceent tht he wns goiug
abroad. He did not say whitler, but they knew at once that his steps
woull be tumned towards Belgium, and were aware that George's widow
was still in Brussels. Tley had pretty aecurate news indeed of poor
Amelia from Lly Dobbin nnd her daughters. Our honest Captain had
been promoted in consequenee of the death of the secoud hIajor of the
regient on the field; anl the brnve O'Dowd, who had distinguished
himself greatly here as upon all occasions where he had a chance to sho
his coolness and valour, was a Colonel and Companion of the Bath.
Very many of the brae -th, who had suflered severely upon both dys
of action, were still at Brussels in the autumi, recovering of their wounds.
The city was a vast military hospitul for months alter the greuat battles;
and as nen and officers began to rally from their hurts, the .gardens and
places of public resort swarmed with maimed warriors old and young,
who, just reseuel out of death, fell to gambling, and gaiety, and love-
making, as people of Vanity Fair will do. Mr. Osborne found out some
of thc -th easily. He kuew their uniform quite well, and had een
usel to follow all the promotions and exchanges in the regiment, nnd
loved to talk about it and its oficers as if he had been one of tle number.
On the day after his arrival at Brussels, and as he issued from his hotel,
which faced the park, he saw a soldier in the well-known facings, reposing
on a stone-bench in the garden, and went and sate down trembling by the
wounded convalescent man.
eWere you in Captain Osborne's companyP'' he said, and added, after
a pause, "`he was my son, Sir,''
The man was not of the Captain's company, but he lifted up his
unwoundel arm and touched his cap sadly and respeectfully to the haggasrd
broken-spirited gentleman who questioned him. ` The whole aruy didn't
eontain a fner or a better officer,'' the soldier said. :The sergeant of
the Captain's company (Captain Rayond had it now), was in town
though, and was just well of a shot in the shoulder. His honour might
see him if he liked, who could tell him anything he wanted to know about
-about the -'s actions. But his honour had seen Msjor Dobbin no
doubt, the brave Captain's great friend; and Mrs. Osborne, who was
here too, anl had been very bad, he heard everybody say. They say she
as out of her minud like for six weeks or more. But your lonour knows
all about that-and asking your parlon ''-the man added.
Osborne put a guinea into the soldier's hand, und told him he should
have another if he would bring the sergeant to the IIotel du Pare;: a
promise which very soon brought the desired officer to MIr. Osborne's
presence. And the first soldier went away; and after telling a comrade
or two how Captain Osborne's father was arrivel, and what a free-handed
generous gentleman he was, they went and made good cheer with drink

and feasting, as long as the guineas lasted which had come from the prud
purse of the mourning old fuather.
In the Serjent's company, who was nlso just convalescent, Osborne
made the journey of Waterloo nnd uatre Bras, a journey which
thousands of his countrymen were then taking. He took the Sergeant
with lim in his carriage, and went tlrough both fields under his guidance.
He saw the point of the road where the regiment marched into action
on the 16th, and the slope down which they drove the French caalry
wvho were pressing on the retreating Belgians. There was the spot where
the noble Captain cut down the French officer who was grappling with the
young Ensign for the colours, the Colour-Sergeants haing becn shot
down. Along this road they retreated on the next day, and here was the
bank nt which the regiment bivouaeked under the rain of the night of the
seventeenth. Further on was the position which they took and held during
the day, forming time after time to receive the charge of the enemy's
horsemen, and lying down under shelter of the bnnk from the furious
kFrench cannonade. And it was at this declivity when at evening the
whole English line receivel the orler to advance, ns the enemy fell back
nfter his lnt charge, that the Captain hurraying and rushing down the
hill waving his sword, received a shot nnd felllead. `` It was Major Dobbin
who took back the Captain's body to Brussels,'' the Sergeant said, in a
low voiee, ``and had him buricd, as your IIonour knows,'' The peasante
nnd relic-hunters nbout the place were screaming round the pair, as the
sollier told his story, offering for snle all sorts of mementoes of the fight,
crosses, and epaulets, nnd shattered cuirasses, and eagles.
Osborne gave a sumptuous reward to the Sergeant whcn he narted with
him, nfter having visited the scenes of his son's lust exploits. His burial
place he had already seen. Indeel he hal driven thither immcdiately
nfter his arrival at Brussels. George's body lny in the pretty burial-
ground of Lncken, near the city ; in which place, having once visited it on
n party of pleasure, he had lightly cxpressed a wish to have his grave
male. And there the young oflticer was lnid by his friend, in the uncon-
seerated corner of the garden, separated by a little hedge from the temples
nnd towns and plantations of flowers and shrubs, under which the Roman
Cathiolic lead repose. It seemed a humiliation to old Osborne to think
that his son, an kEnglish gentleman, a Captain in the famous British army,
should not be found worthy to lie in ground where mere foreigners were
buried. WVhich of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our
warmest regnard for others, and how selfish our love is Old Osborue
did not speculate much upon the mingled nature of his feelings, and how
his instinct and selfishness were combating together. He firmly believed
that everything he lid was right, that he ought on all oeeasions to have
his own way-and like the sting of a wasp or serpent his hatred rushed
out nrmed and poisonous against anything like opposition. He was
proud of his hatred as of everything else. Always to be right, always to
trample forward, and never to doubt, are not these the great qunlities with
which dullness takes the lead in the world

were a couple of ladies and a gentleman, and by the side of which an
officer was riding. Osborne gave a astart back, and the Sergeant, seatel
with him cast a look of surprise at his neighbour, as he touched his cap
to tle ofhicer, who mechanically returned his salute. It was Amelia, with
the lamo young Ensign by her side, and opposite to her her faithful friend
Mrs. O'Dowd. It was Amelia, but how changel from the fresl nud
comely girl Osborne knew. Her face was white and thin. ler pretty
brown hair was parted under a widow's cap-the poor child. ller eyes
were fixed, and looking nowhere. They stared blank in the fnce of
Osborne, as the carriages crossed each other, but she did not know him;
nor dil he recognise her, until looking up, he saw bDobbin ridiug by her,
and then he knew who it was. He hated her. He did not know how
much until he saw her there. When her carriage had pussed on, he
turned and stared at the Sergeant, with a curse and defiance in his eye,
cast at his companion, who could not help looking at him-as uch
as to sny. `` How dnre yo look at me Damn you: I do hate her.
It is she who has tumbled my hopes and all my pride down.''  Tall
the scoundrel to drive on quick,'' he shouted with an oath, to the lackey
on the box. A minute afterwards, a horse came clattering over the pave-
ment behind Osborne's carriage, and Dobbin rode up. His thoughts had
been elsewhere as the ecarriages passed euch other, and it was not util he
had ridden some paces forward that he remembered it was Osborne who
had just passed him. Then he turned to examine if the sight of her
father-in-law had made any impression on Amelia, but the poor girl did
not know who had passed. Then Willium, who daily uscd to accompany
her in his drives, taking out his watch, made some excuse nbout an
engagement which he suldenly recolleeted, and so rode ofl. She did not
remark that cither: but sate looking before her, over te homely landscape
towards the woods in the distance, by which Gcorge marehed away.
Mr. Osborne, Mr. Osbornel'' oeried Dobbin, as he rode up and held
out his hand. Osborne made no motion to take it, but shouted out once
nore and with another curse to his servant to drive on.
Dobbin laid his hand on the carriage side. I will see you, Sir,'' he
said. ``I huve a message for you.''
From thut wonan P'' snil Osborne, fiercely.
No,'' replied the other, ``from your son;'' at which Osborne fell back
into the corner of his carriage, and Dobbin allowing it to pass on, rode
close behind it, and so through the town until they reached Mr. Osborne's
hotel, and without a word. There he followed Osborne up to lis apart-
ments. George had often been in the rooms; they were the lodgings
which the Crawleys had occupied during their stay in Brussels.
 Pray, hwve yoeu any commands for me, Captain Dobbin, or, I cg
your pardon, I should sny Maior Dobbin, since better men than you are
dead, and you step into their sloes,'' snid Mr. Osborne, in that sarcastic
tone which he sometimes was pleased to assume.

remain in good temper, and went on without hceding the interruption.

reason almost have been shaken by the blow wlich has fallen on her. It
is ery doubtful whether she will rally. There is a chance left for her
however, and it is about this I came to speak to you. She will be a
mother soon. Will you visit the parent's offence upon the child's head:
or will you forgive the ehild for poor George's sukeP''
Osborne broke out into a rhapsody of self-praise and imprecatios. By
the first, excusing himself to his own conscienee for his conduct; by the
second, exaggerating the undutifulucess of George. No father in all
England could have behaved more generously to a son, who had rebelled
agaiust him wickedly. IIe had died without even so much as confessing
he was rong. Let him take the consequences of his undutifulness and
folly. As for himself, Mr. Osborne, he was a man of his word. He
had sworn never to speak to that womn or to recognise er as his son's
wife.  And that's what you may tell her,'' he coneluded with an oatl;
`'and tbhnt 's wvhat I will stick to to the last day of my lite.''
There was no hope from that quarter then. The widow ust lie on
her slender pittancce, or on such aid ss Jos could give her. I might tell
her, andl she would not heed it,'' thought Dobbin sadly: for tle poor
girl's thoughts were not lere nt nll since her catastrophe, and stupified
under the pressure of her sorrow, good and eil wcere nlike indifferent

her grief.

portion of that time in a sorrow so profound and pitiable, that we who
have been watching and lescribing some of the eiotions of thant weak
and tender heart, must draw baek in the presence of the cruel grief under
whiceh it is bleeding. Tread silently round the hapless couch of the poor
prostrate soul. Shut gently the door of the dark chamber, wherein she
suffers, as those kind people did wlo nursed her through the first montls

was to hear its first cry1 How she laughed and wept over it-how love,

and lcad which the persons, wlo had constantly been with hcr, had
passed, to see her eyes once more beamiug tenderly upon them.
Our friend Dobbin was one of them. It was he who brought her back
to England and to her mother's house; when Mrs. O'Dod, receiving a
peremaptory summons from her Colonel, had been foreed to quit her
patient. To ee Dolbin holding the infant, and to hear Amelia's laugh of
triumpl as she watched him, would have done nny man good who had a
sense of humour. William was the godfather of the child, and exerted his

little Christin.
How his mother nursed him, and dressed him, and livel upon him; low
she drove away all nurses, and would scarce allow nny hand but her own
to touch him; how she considered that the greatest favour sle could
confer upon his godfather, Major Dobbin, was to allow the MIajor occa-
sionally to dandle him, need not be told here. This child was her being.
IIer existenee was a maternal caress. Shc enveloped the fceble and
unconscious creature with loe and worship. It was her life which thc
baby drank in from her bosom. Of nights, and when alone, she hal
stealthy and intense rapturcs of motherly loe, such ns God's marvellous
care has awarded to the female iustinet-joys how far higler anl lowcr
than reason-blind beautiful devotions which only women's hearts kow.
It was William Dobbin's task to muse upon these movecnts of Aelia's,
and to watch her heart ; and if his love mde him divine almost all thc
feelings which agitated it, alas l he could see with n fatal pcrspicuity that
there was no place there for lim. And so, gently, he bore lis fute, kuowing
it, and content to bear it.
lI suppose Amelin's father and mother saw tlough the iuteutions of the
Major, and were not ill-disposed to encourage him; for Dobbin risitced
tleir louse daily, and stayed for hours with them, or with Amclia, or with
the honest landlord, Mr. Clapp, nd his family. He broughlt, on one
pretext or anotler, prcsents to everybody, and almost every day; anl
went with the landlord's little girl who was rather a fuvourite with
Amelia, by the name of Mjor Sugarplums. It was this little child who
commonuly acted as mistress of the ceremonies to introducc him to Irs.
Osborne. She laughed one day when Mlajor Sugarplums' cab drove up to
Fulhm, and he descendel from it, bringing out a woolen lorse, a urum,
a trumpet, and other warlike toys, for little Gcorgy, who was scnrcely sixs
months old, and for whom the articles in question were entirely premature.
The child was asleep. `Hushl,'' sid Amelia, annoyed, perhas, at the
creaking of the Mlajor's boots; and she hecld out her hand; smiliug beeause
William could not take it until he had ril limself of his cargo of toys.
 Go down stasirs, little Mary,'' said he prcsently to the elild, 'I wnt to
speak to Mrs. Osborne.'' She looked up rather astonisled, and laid down
the infant on its bed.
 I am come to say good-bye, Amelia,'' said he, taking ler slender little
white hand gently.
Good-bye?' and where are you going 2'' she said, with a smile.
`Send the letters to the agents,'' he snid; `` tley will forward them;
for yon will write to e, won't you? I shall be uway a long time.''

The little pink hands of the clild elosed meehasnically round the honest
soldier's finger, and Amelia lookel up in his face with bright maternal
plesure. The cruellest looks could not have wounded him more than that
glance of hopeless kindness. He bent over the child and mother. He
could not speak for a moment. And it was with ll his strength that he
could force himself to say a God bless you. ``Gol bless you,'' said Amelia,
aul held up her face and kissed him.
Hush.l Dont wake Georgy I'' she added, as William Dobbin went to
the door with heavy steps. She did not hear the noise of his cab-wheele
as he drove away: she was looking at the child, who was laughing in his

Vanity Fir of ours so little

times about the worldly affairs

I know the equipage is only job-

three men and the carriage must represent an expense of six hundred
a-year at the very least-and then there are the splendid dinners, the
two boys at Eton, the prize governess and masters for the girls, thc
trip abroad, or to Enstbourne or Worthing in the autumn, the annual
ball with a supper from Gunter's (who, by the way, supplies most of thc
frst-rate dinners which J. gives, as Iknow very well, having been invited to
one of them to fill a vacant place, when I saw at onee that these repasts

last year from Boulognef
eI,'' is here introduced to personify the world in general-the Mrs.
Grundy of each respected reader's private circle-every one of whom can
point to some families of his acquaintance who live nobody knows how.
Many a glass of wine have we all of us drunk, I have very little doubt,
hob-and-nobbing with the hospitable giver, and wondering how the leuce
he paid for it.
Some three or four years after his stay in Paris, when Rawdon Crawley
and his wife were established in a very small comfortable house in Curzon
Street, Mayfair, there was scareely one of the numerous friends whom they
entertained at dinner that did not ask the above question regarling them.
The novelist, it has been said before, knows everything, anl as I am in
a situation to be able to tell the publie how Crawley and his wife livel
without any iucome, may I entreat the public newspapers wlich are in the
habit of extracting portions of the arious periodical works now published,
not to reprint tle following exaet narrative and calculuations-of which I
ouglt, as the discoverer, (nnd at some expense, too,) to have tle benefit,
My son,-I would say, were I blessed with a child-you may by deep
inquiry and constant intereourse with him, learn how a man lies com-
fortably on nothing a-year. But it is best not to be intimate with gentle-
men of this profession, and to take the calculations at second-land, as you
do logarithms, for to work them yourself, depend upon it, will cost you
something considerable.
On nothing per annum then, and during a course of some two or three
years, of which we can aforl to give but a very brief istory, Crawley
and his wife lived ery happily and comfortably at Paris. It was in this
periol tlat he quitted the Guards, and sold out of the army. When we
find him again, his mustaehios and the title of Colonel on his card are the
only relics of his military profession.
It has been mentioned that Rebecca, soon after her arrival in Paris, took
n very smart and leading position in the society of that capital, and was
welcomed at some of tle most distinguishel houses of the restorel French
nobility. The English men of faslion in Pris courted her, too, to the
disgust of the ladies their wives, who could not bear the prvenue. For
some montls the salons of the Faubourg St. Germain, in which her
place was secured, and the splendours of the new Court, where she was
received with uch distinction, delighted, and perhaps a little intoxicated
MIrs. Crawley, wlo may have been disposed during this period of elation
to slight tle people-honest young nilitary men mostly,-who formed
hcr husband's chief society.
But the Colonel yawned sadly among the duclesses and great lalies of
the Court. The old women who played eart made such a noise nbout a
five-iranc piece, tbat it was not worth Colonel Crawley's while to sit down
at a card-table. The wit of their conversation he could not appreciate,
being ignorant of their languge. And what good could his wife get, he
urged, by making curtsies every night to a whole circle of Princessesf
He left Rebecca presently to frequent these parties alone; resuming his
own simple pursuits and amusements amongst the amiable friends of his
owm choice.
A NOYEL WITHOUT A HERO.

The truth is, when we say of a gentleman that he lives elegantly on nothing
a-year, we use the word '`nothing,'' to signify something unknown; mean-
ing, simply, that we don't know how the gentleman in question defrays the
expenses of his establishment. Now, our friend the Colonel had a great
aptitude for all gsmes of chanee: and exercising himself, s he continually
did, with the cards, the dice-box, or the cue, it is natural to suppose that
he attained a much greater skill in the use of these articles than men cana
possess who only occasionally handle them. To use a cue at billiards
well is like using a pencil, or a German flute, or a small-sword-you
cannot master any one of these implements at first, and it is only by
repeated study and perseveranee, joined to a natural taste, that a man can
excel in the handling of either. Now Crawley, from being only a brilliant
amateur had grown to be a eonsummate master of billiards. Like a great
general, his genius used to rise with the dasnger, and when the luck had
been unfaourable to him for a whole gume, and the bets were consequently
against him, he would, with consummute skill and boldness, make some
prodigious hits which would restore the battle, and come in a victor at the
end, to the astonishment of everybody-of everybody, that is, who was a
stranger to his play. Those who were aceustomed to see it were cautious
how they staked their money against a man of such sudden reeources, and
brilliant, and overpowering skill.

and making sueh blunders, that new comers were often inclined to think
meanly of his talent; yet when roused to acetion, and awakened to
caution by repeated small losses, it was remarked that Crawley's play
became quite different, and that he was pretty sure of beating his enemy
thoroughly before the night was over. Indeed, very few men could sasy
that they ever hadl the better of him.
His successes were so repeated that no wonder the envious and the
vanquished spoke sometimes with bitterness regarding them. And as the
French say of the Duke of Wellington, who never suffered as defeat, thnt
only an astonishing series of lucky aecidents enabled him to be an invario
able winner; yet even they allow that he cheated at Waterloo, and was
enabled to win the last great trick:-so it was hinted at head-quarters in
England, that some foul play must have taken place in order to acoount
for the continuous suceesses of Colonel Crawley.
Though Frasscati's and the Salon were open at that time in Paris, the
mania' for play was so widely spread, that the public gnmbling-rooms did
not suffice for the general ardour, and gumbling went on in private houses
as much as if there had been no public means for gratifying the passion.
At Crawley's charming little reinions of an evening this fatal amusement
commonlywas practised-muchto good-natured littleMrs, Crawley's annoy-
ance. She spoke about her husband's passion for dice with the deepest
grief; she bewailed it to everybody who came to her house. She besought
thc young fellows never, never to touch a box; and when young Green,
of the lifles, lost a very considerable sum of money, ebecca passed a
whole night in tears, as the servant told the unfortunate young gentleman,
nnd actually went on her knees to her husband to beseech him to remit
the debt, and burn the ackowledgment. How could he He had
lost just as much himself to Blackstone of the Hussars, and Count
Punter of the Hanoverian Cavalry. Green might have any decent time;
but pay ?-of course he must pay;-to talk of burning I O U's was
child's-play.
Other officers, chiefly young-for the young fellows gathered round Mrs.
Crawley-came from her parties with long face, having dropped more or
less money at her fatal card-tables. Her house began to have an unfor-
tunate reputation. The old hands warnel the less experienceed of their
dnnger. Colonel O'Dowd, of the -th regiment, one of those occupying
in Paris, warned Lieutenant Spooney of that corps. A loud and violent
fracas took place between the infantry-colonel and his lady, who were diuing
nt the Cafe le Paris, and Colonel and Mrs. Crawley, who were also taking
their meal there. The ladies engaged on both sides. Mrs. O'Dowd snapped
her fingers in Mrs. Crawnley's face, and cnlled her husband '` no betther
than a black-leg.'' Colonel Crawley challenged Colouel O'Dowd, C.B.
1he Commander-in-Chief hering of the dispute sent for Colonel Crawley,
who was getting ready the same pistols, `which he shot Captain Marker,'
nd hnd such a conversation with hi that no duel took place. If Rebeecca
had not gone on her knees to General Tufto, Crawlcy would have been
sent back to England; and he did not play, exeept with civilians, for
some weeks after.
ut in spite of Rawdon's undoubted skill and constant suceesses, it

became evident to Rebecca, considering these things, that their position
was but a prccarious one, and that even, although they paid scarcely any-
body, their little capital would end one day by dwindling into zero.
 Gambling,'' she would say, `` dear, is good to help yonr income, but not
as an income itself. Some day people may be tired of play, and then
where nre we'' Rnwdon uaequiesced in the justice of her opinion; nnd
in truth he had remarked that after a few nights of his little suppers, &c.,
gentlemen ere tired of play with lim, anud, in spite of Rebeeca's charms,
did not present themselves very eagerly.
Ensy and pleasant as their life at Paris wns, it was after all only an
idle dallianee and amiable tritling ; nnd Rebecc saw that she must push
Ruawdon's fortune in their own country. She must get him a place or
appointment at home or in the colonies; and she determined to make a
move upon England as soon as the way could be cleared for her. As a
first step she had made Crawley sell out of the Guards, and go on hnlf-
pay. His function as aide-de-cnp to Gcneral Tufto had censed pre-
viously. Rebecea laughed in all companies nt that officer, at his toupee
(which he mounted on coming to Pnris), at his wistband, at his falsc
teeth, at his pretensions to be a lady-killer above all, and his absurd
vuanity in faneying every woman whom he came uear was in love with him.
It wus to Mrs. Brent, the beetle-browed wife of Mr. Commissary Brent, ta
whom the General transferred his atteutions now-his bouquets, his
dinners at the restaurateurs, his opera-boxes, and his knick-knacks. Poor
Mrs. Tufto was no more happy than before, and hnl still to pass long
eenings alone with ler daughters, knowing that her General was gone off
scented and curled to stand behinl Mrs. Brent's chair at the play.
Becky had a dozen admirers in his place to be sure; and could cut her
rival to picees with her wit. But as we have said, she was growing tired
of this idle social life: opera-boxes and restaurateur-dinners palled upon
her: uosegays could not be laid by as a provision for futuro years: and
she could not live upon knick-knaeks, laced handkerchiefs, and kid gloves.
She felt the frivolity of pleasure, and longed for more substantial benefits.
At this juncture news arrived which was spread among the many
ereditors of the Colonel at Paris, and which cnusel them great satisfaction.
Miss Crawley, the rich ant from whom he expeeted his imense inherit-
ance, was dying; the Colonel must haste to her bed-side. Mrs. Crawley
and her child would remain behinl until he came to reclaim them. He
departed for Culais, and having reachel that place in safety, it might have
been supposed that he went to Dover; but instead he took the Diligenc
to Dunkirk, and thence trnvelled to Brussels, for which place he had a
former predilection. The fact is, he owed ore money at London than at
Paris; and he preferred the quiet little Belgian city to either of the more
noisy capitals.
Her aunt was dead. Mrs. Crwley ordered the most intense mourning
for herself and little Rawdon. TheColonel was busy arranging the affairs
of the inheritanee. They could take the premier now, instead of the little
entresol of the hotel which they occupied. Mrs. Crawley and the landlord
had a consultation about the new hangings, an amicnble wrangle about the
carpets, and a final adjustment of everything except the bill. Bhe went

off in one of his carriages; her French onne with her; the child by her side;
the admirable landlord and landlady smiling farewell to her from the gate.
General Tufto was furious when he heard she was gone, and Mrs. Brent
furious with him for being furious ; Lieutenant Spooney was cut to the
heart; and the landlord got ready his best apartments previous to the
return of the fascinating little woman and her husband.  He erred the
trunks which she left in his charge with the greatest care. They had
been especially recommende to him by Madame Crawley. They were not,
howeer, found to be particularly valuable when opened some time after.
But before she went to join her husband in the Belgic capital, Mrs.
Crawley made an expedition into England, leaving behind her her little
son upon tle continent, under the care of her French maid.
The parting between Rebeccea and the little Rawdon did not cause either
party much pain. She had not, to say truth, seen much of the young
gentleman since his birth. After the nmiable fuashion of French mothers,
she hal placed him out at nurse in a village in the nciglbourhood of Paris,
where little Rawdon passed the first month of his life, not unhappily, with

Reheecca did not care much to go and see the son and heir. Once he
spoiled a new doe-culure peliseo of hars. He preferred his nurse's
caresses to his mamma's, and whon finally he quittod that jolly nurse und
almost parent, he cried loudly for hours. IIe was only consoled by lia
mother's promise that hc should return to his nurse the next day; indeed
the nurse herself, who probably would have been pained at tle parting
too, was told that the child would immedintely be restored to her, and for
some time awaited quite anxiously is return.
In fact, our friends may be snid to have been nmong the first of that
brood of hardy English adventurers who have subsequently invadel tle

happy days' of 1817-18, was very great, for the wealth and honour of
Britons. They had not then learned, as I am told, to laggle for bargains
with the pertinacity which now distinguishes them. The great citics of

accents as he spoke of that catastrophe.
Rebeccn's object in her journey to London was to effect a kindl
of comprorise with her husbnd's numerous creditors, and by offer-
ing them an dividend of ninepence or a shilling in the pound, to
secure a return for him into his own country. It loes not become us
to trace the steps which she took in the conduct of this most difficult
negotiation; but, having shown them to their satisfaction, that the sum

which she was empowered to offer was all her husband's nvailable capital,
and having convinced them that Colonel Crawley would prefer a perpetual
retirement on the continent to a residence in this country with his debts
unsettled; having provel to thoma tat tlere was no possibility of money
aeeruing to him from othr quurtera, and no earthly chance of their getting
a larger dividend than that wlich she was empowered to offer, she brought
the Colonel's creditors unanimously to accept her proposals, and purchased
with fifteen hlred pounds of ready money, more than ten times that
amount of debts.
Mrs. Crnwley employed no lawyer in the transaction. The matter was
so simple, to hase or to leave, as she justly observed, that she made the
lawyers of the crelitors themselves do the business. And Mr. Lewis
representing Mr. Davids of Red Lion quare, and Mr. Moss acting for
Mr. Manasseh of Cursitor Street, (chief creditors of the Colonel's), compli-
mented his lady upon the brilliant way in which she did business, and
deelared that there was no professional man who could beat her,
Rebecca received their congratulations with perfect modesty ; ordered a
bottle of sherry and a bread cake to the little dingy lodgings where she
dwelt, while conducting the business, to trcat the enemy's lawyers; shook
hands with them at puarting, in excellent good humour, and returned
straightway to the continent, to rejoin her husband and son, and aequint
the former with tle glad news of his entire liberation. As for the latter,
he had been considerably neglected during his mother's absence by
Mademoiselle Gcnevieve, her Freneh maid; for that young woman, con-
tracting an attaehment for a soldier in the garrison of Calais, forgot her
charge in the society of this nilitaire, and little Rawdon very narrowly
escaped drowning on Calais snnds at this period, where the absent Genevieve
had left and lost him.
And so, Colonel and Mrs. Crawley came to London : and it is at their
honse in Curzon Street, May Fair, that they really showed the skill which
must be possessed by those who would live on the resources abovre named.

necessity, we are bound to describe how a house
may be got for nothing a-year. These mansions
are to be had either unfurnished, where, if you
have credit with Messrs. Gillows or Bantings,
yeu can get them splendidly arranged and deco-
rated entirely, according to your own faney; or
they are to be let furnished; a less troublesomec
and complicated arrangement to most parties.
It was so that Crawley and his wife preferred to
hire their house.
Before Mr. Bowls cme to preside over Miss
Crawley's house and cellar iu Park Lane, that
lady had had for a butler, a Mr. Raggles, wha
was born on the family estate of Queen's Crawley,
and indeed was u younger son of a gardeuer
there. By good conduct, a handsome person
and calves, and grave demeanour, Raggles rose from the knife-board to
the foot-board of the carriage; from the foot-board to the butler's pantry.
When he had been a certain number of yenrs at the head of Miss Crawley's
establishment, where he had had good wages, fat perquisites, and plenty of
opportunities of saving, he announeed that he was ubout to contract n
matrimonial alliance with a late cook of Miss Crawley's, who lad subsisted
in an honourable manner by the exercise of a tnangle, and the keeping of a
emall green shop in the neighbourhood. The truth is, that te ceremony
had been clandestinely performed some years back; although the news of
Mr. Raggle's marriage was first brought to Miss Crawley by a little boy
and girl of seven and eight years of age, whose continual presence in the
kitchen had attraeted the attention of Miss Briggs.
Mr. Raggles then retired and personally undertook the superintendenee
of the small shop and the greens. He added milk and eream, eggs and
country fed pork to his stores, contenting himself, whilst other retired
butlers were vending spirits in public houses, by dealing in the simplest
ocountry produce. And having a good connection amongst the butlers in
tha neighbourhool, and a snug back parlour where he and Mrs. Raggles
received them, his milk, cream, and eggs got to be adopted by many of
the fraternity, and his profits increased every year. Year after year he
quietly and modestly amassed money, anl when at length that snug and
eemplete bachelor's residenee at No. 201, Curzon Street, Mny Fair, lately

the residence of the Hanourahle Felerieck Deuceaet, gone abroad, with
its rich and appropriate furniture by the first makers, was brought to the
hammer, who should go in and purchsse the lease and furniture of tho
house but Charles Raggles? A part of the money he borrowed, it is true,
and at ratler a high interest, from a brother butler, but the chief part he
paid lown, and it was with no smnl pride that Mrs. Raggles fouud herself
sleeping in a bed of carved mahogany, with silk curtains, with a prodigious
chevnl glass opposite to her, and a wardrobe which would contain her, and
Raggles, and all the family.
Of course, they did not intend to occupy permanently an apartment
so splendid. It was in orler to let the house again that Raggles pur-
chased it. As soon as a tenant was found, he suhsided into the green-
grocer's slop once more; but a happy thing it was for him to walk out of
that tenement and into Curzon Street, and there survey his house-his
own house-with geraniums in the window and a cnrved bronze knocker.
The footman occasionally lounging at the area railing, treated him with
respect; tle cook took her green stuff at his louse and called him Mr.
Lundlord; and there was not one thing the tenants did, or one dish
which they hal for dinner, that Raggles might not know of, if he liked.
He was a gool man; good nd happy. The house brought him in so
handsome a yearly incoe, that he was determined to send his children to
good schools, and nccordingly, regardless of expense, Charles was sent to
boardiug at Dr. Swishtail's, ugar-cue Lodge, and little Matildn to Mis
Peekover's, Luurentinum House, Clapham.
Raggles lovel and adored the Crawley fnmily as the author of all his
prosperity in life. He had a silhouette of his mistress in his back shop,
and a drawing of the Porter's ILodge at ueen's Craswley, done by that
spinster herself in India ink-and the only addition he mtde to the deco-
rations of the Curzon Street Ionse was a print of ueen's Crawley in
Hampshire, the Seat of Sir Walpole Crawley, Baronet, who was repre-
sented in a gilded car drawn by six white horses, and passing by a lake
covered with swans, and barges containing ladies in hoops, and musicians
with flags and periwigs. Indecd, Raggles thought there was no such
palace in anll the world, anl no such august family.
As luek woull have it, Raggles' house in Curzon Street was to let when
Rawdon and his wife returued to London. The Colonel knew it and its
owner quite well; the latter's connexion with the Crawley family had been
kept up constantly, for Raggles helped Mr. Bowls whenever Miss Crnwley
receivced friends. And the old man not only let his house to the Colonel,
but officiated ns his butler whenever he had company; Mrs. Iaggles
operating iu the kitchen below, and aending up dinners of which old Miss
Crnwley herself might have approved. This was the way, then, Crawley
got his house for nothing : for though Raggles had to pay taxes and rates,
and the interest of thc mortgage to the brother butler; and the insurance
of his life,; and the charges for his children at school ; and the value of the
meat and drink which his own family-and for a time that of Colonel
Crawley too-consumed; and though the poor wretch was utterly ruined
by the trnnsnction, his children being flung on the streets, and limself
drion into the Fleet Prison; yet somebody must pay even for gentlemen

who live for nothing a-year-and so it was this unlucky Raggles was
made the representative of Colonel Crawley's defective capital.
I wonder how many families nre driven to roguery nnd to ruin by great
practitioners in Crawley's wuy -how many great noblemen rob their petty
tradesmen, condescend to swindle their poor retainers out of wretehed
little sums, and cheat for a few shillings Whn we rend that n noble
nobleman has left for the continent, or that another noble nobleman hns
an execution in his house-and thnt one or other owe six or seven
millions, the defeat seems glorious evenaand we respect the victim in the
vastness of his ruin. But who pities a poor barber who can't get his
money for powdering the footmen's hends; or a poor carpenter who has
ruined himself by fixing up ornaments and pailions for my lady's
lieun' or the poor devil of n tailor whom the steward patronises, and who
has pledged all he is worth, and more, to gct the liveries rcady, which my
lorl has lone him the honour to bcspcak -When the great house
tumbles down, these miserable wretches fall under it unnoticed: as they
say in the old legends, before a man goes to the devil limself, he sends
plenty of other souls thither.
Rawdon and his wife generously gave their patronage to all sueh of
Miss Crawley's tradesmen and purveyors ns chose to serve them. Some
were willing enough, especially the poor ones. It was wonderful to see
te ertinacity with wlich the washerwoman from Tooting brought the
cnrt every Saturday, and her bills week after week. Mr. Raggles himself
hnd to supply the green-groceries. The bill for serants' porter at the
Fortune of Wur public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of heer.
Every servant also was owel the greater part of his wages, and thus kept up
perforce an interest in the housce. Nobody in fact wss paid. Not thoe
blacksmith who openel the lock; nor the glazier who mendet the pane;
or the jobber who let the carriage; nor the groom who drove it; nor the
butcher who provided the leg of mutton; nor the conls which roasted it;
nor the cook who basted it; nor the servants who ent it: and this I am
given to understand is not unfrequently the way in which pcople live
elegntly on nothing n-year.
In a little town such things cannot be done without remark. We know
there the qunntity of milk our neighhour takes, and espy thc joint or the
ftowls which are going in for his dinner. So, probbly, 200 and 202 in
Curzon Street might know what was going on in the house between
them, the servants communicating through the area-railings; but Crawley
and his wife and his friends did not know 200 and 202. When you came
to 201 there was a hearty welcome, a kind smile, a good dinner, and a
jolly shake of the hand from the host and hostess there, just for all the
world, as if they had been undisputed mnsters of three or four thousand a
year-and so they were, not in money, but in produce and labour-if they
did not pay for the mutton, they had it: if they did not gie bullion in
exchange for their wine, how should we know? Never wns better claret at
any man's table than at honest Rawdon's; dinners more gay and neatly
served. His drawing rooms were the prettiest, little, molest salons con-
ceivable: they were decorated with the greatest taste, and a thousand knick-

songs with a lightsome heart, the stranger voted himself in a little paradise
of domestic comfort, and agreed that if the husband was rather stupid, tle
wife was charming, and the dinners the pleasantest in the world.
Rebecca's wit, cleverness, and flippney, made ler speedily the vogue in
London among a certain class. ou saw demure chariots at her door, out
of which stepped very great people. ou beheld her carriage in the park,
surroundel by dandies of note. The little box in the third tier of the
Opera was crowded with heads constantly changing; but it must be con-
fessed that the ladies held uloof from her, and that their doors were shut
to our little adventurer.
With regard to the world of femnle fashion and its customs, the present
writer of course can only speak at second hand. hA mnn can no more pene-
trate or understand those mysteries than he can know what the ladies talk
about when they go up stairs after dinner. It is only by inquiry and per-
seerance, that one sometimes gets hints of those secrets; and by a similar
diligence every person who treads the Pall Mall pavement and frequents the
elubs of this metropolis, knows, either through his own experience or
through some aequaintance with whom he plays at billiards or shares the
joint, something about the genteel world of London, and how, as there
are men (such as Rawdon Crawley, whose position we mentioned before),
who cut a good figure to the eyes of the ignorant world and to the appren-
tices in the Park, who behold them consorting with the most notorious
dandies there, so there are ladics, who may be called men's women,
heing welcomed entirely by all tho gentlemen, und cut or slighted by all
their wies. Mrs. Firebrace is of this sort; the lady with the heautiful
fair ringlets whom you see every day in Hyde Park, surrounded by the
greatest and most famous dandies of this empire. Mrs. lockwood is
another, whose parties are announced laboriously in the fashionable news-
papers, and with whom you see that all sorts of ambassadors and great
noblemen dine; and many more might be mentioned had they to do with
the history at present in hand. But while simple folks who are out of
the world, or country people with ns taste for the genteel, behold these
ladies in their seeming glory in public places, or envy them from alfar off,
persons who are better instrueted could inform them that these envied
ladies have no more chance of establishing themselves in ``society,'' than
the benighted squire's wife in Somersetshire, who reads of their doings in
the Morning Post. Men living about London are aware of these awful
truths. You hear how pitilessly many ladies of seeming rank and welth
are excluded from this ``aociety.'' The frantic efforts which they make
to enter this circle, the meannesses to which they submit, the insults
which they undergo, are matters of wonder to those who take human ar
womankind for a study; and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties
would be s fine theme for any very great person who had the wit, th
leisure, and the knowledge of the English Ilanguage neeessary for the
compiling of such a history.
Now the few female aequaintances whom Mrs Crawley had known
abronsd, not only declined to visit her when she came to this aide of the
channel, but cut her severely when they met in public places. It was
curious to see how the great ladies forgot ler, and no doubt not ltogether

a pleasant study to Rebececa. When Lady bBareacres met her in the waiting-
room at the Opera, she gathered her daughters about her as if tley would
be contaminated by a touch of Beeky, and retreating a step or two, plaeed
herself in front of them, and stared at her little enemy. To stare Beeky
out of countenance required n severer glance than even the frigid old
Barencres could shoot out of her dismal aeyes. When Lady de la Mole, who
hal ridden a seore of times by HBesky's side at Brussels, met Mrs. Crawley's
open carriage in Hyle Park, her Ladyship was quite blind, and could not in
the lcast reeognize her former friend. Even Mrs. Blenkinsop, the banker'as
wife, cut her at church. Becky went regularly to church now ; it was edi-
fying to see her enter there with Rawdon by her side, carrying a couple of
large gilt prayer-books, and afterwards going through the ceremony with
the gravest resignation.
Rawdon at first felt very acutely the slights which were passed upon his
wife, and was inelined to be gloomy andsavage: He talkel of calling out
the husbands or brothers of every one of the insolent women who did not
pay a proper respeet to his wife; and it was only by the strongest com-
mands and entreaties on her part, that he was brought into keeping n
deeent behaviour. ' ou can't shoot me into society,'' she said good-
naturedly. ``' Remember, my dear, that I was but a governess, and

breach of intercourse. Rwdon Crawley's conduct, on the other hand,
who got but a hundred pounds, was such as to astonish his brother and
delight his sister-in-law, who was disposed to look kindly upon all thc
members of her husband's family. He wrote to lis brother a very frank,
manly, good-umoured letter from Paris. He wns aware, he said, that
by his own marriage he had forfeited his aunt's faour; and though he
did not disguise his disappointment that she slould have been so entirely
relentless towards him, he was glad that the money was still kept in their
branch of the family, and heartily congratulated his brother on his good
fortune. He sent his affectionate remembrances to his sister, and hoped
to have her gool-will for Mrs, Crawley; and the letter concluded with a
postscript to Pitt in the latter ldy's own hand-writing. She, too, begged
to join in her husband's congratulations. She shoull ever remember Mr
Crawley's kindness to her in early days when she was a friendless orphan,
the instructress of his little sisters, in whose welfare she still took the
tenderest interest. She wisled him every happiness in his murried life,
and, asking his permission to offer her remembrances to Lady Jane (of
whose goodness all the world informed her), she hoped that one day she
might be allowed to present her little boy to his uncle and aunt, and
begged to bespeak for him their good-will and protection.
Pitt Crawley received this letter very graeiously-more graciously than
Miss Crawley had received some of Rebecca's previous compositions in
Rawdon's hand-writing; and ns for Lady Jane, she was so charmed with
the letter, that she expected her husband would instantly divide her
aunt's legacy into two equal portions, and send off one-half to his brother
at Paris.
To her ladyship's surprise, however, Pitt declined to aceommodate his
brother with a check for thirty thousand pounds. But he made Rawdon
a handsome ofer of his hand whenever the latter slould come to England
and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs, Crawley for her good opinion of
himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to take
any opportunity to serve her little hoy.
Thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers.
When Rebecca came to town Pitt nnd his wife were not in London. Many
a time she drove by the oll door in Park Lane to see whether they had
taken possession of Miss Crawley's house there. But the new fumily did
not mske its appearence; it was only through aggles that she heard of
their movements-how Miss Crawley's domestics had been dismissed with
deeent gratuities, and how Mr. Pitt hnd only once made his appearance in
London, when le stopped for a few days at the house, did business with
his lawyers there, and sold off nll Miss Crawley's French novels to a book-
seller out of Bond Street. Bccky had reasons of her own which caused
her to long for the arrival of her new relation. ``When Lady Jane comes,''
thought she, `` she shall be my sponsor in London socicty; and as for
the womenl bah l-the women will ask me when they find the men want
to see me.''

commonly, and didn't much meddle with te conversation except when it
was about horses and betting.

down continued.
`I mean a moral shepherd's dog,'' said Becky, lauging, and looking
up at Lorl Steyne.

`'A log to keep the wolves off me,'' Rebecca continued. "A com-

Dear little innocent lamb, you want one,'' said the MIarquis; and his
jaw thrust out, anl he began to grin hideously, his little eyes leering
towards Rebecca.
The great Lord of Steyne was standing by the fire sipping coffce. The
fire crackled and blnzed pleasantly. There was a score of candles sprkling
round the mantelpicce, in all sorts of qunint sconces, of gilt and bronze
nnd porcelain. Thcy lighted up Rebecca'as figure to admiration, as she
sate on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers. She was in a pink
dress, that looked as fresh as a rose; her dazzling white arms and shoulders
were hulf covered ith a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled; her
hair hung in curls round her neck; one of her little feet peeped out from

The candles lighted np Lord Steyne's shining bld head, which was
fringed with red hair. He had thick bushy eyebrows, with little twinkling
bloodsliot eyes, surrounded by a thousand wrinkles. His jaw was under-
hung, and whenu he laughed, two white buck-teeth protruded themselves
anl glistened savagely in the midst of the grin. He had been dining
with royal personages, and wore his gurter and ribbon. A short man was
his Lordship, broad-chested, and bow-legged, but proud of the fineness of
his foot and ancle, and always caressing his garter-knee.
`And so the hepherd is not enough,'' said he, ``to defend his lambkin''
The Shepherd is too fond of playing at cards and going to his clubs,''
answered Becky, laughing.

Rebecca's eyes shot out gleams of seornful humour.  My lord,'' she
said, ``you are a knight of the Ordcer.'' He had the collar round his neck,
indeed-a gift of the restored Princes of Spain.
Lord Steyne in early life had been notorious for his daring and his
success at play. He hal sat up two days and two nights with Mr. Fox at
haznrl. He lad won money of the most august personages of the realm:
he had won his marquisate, it was sid, at the gaming-table ; but he did
not like an allusion to those by-gone fredaies. Rebecca saw the scowl
guthering over his heavy brow.
Bhe rose up from her sofa, and went and took his coffee cup ont of his
hand, with a little curtsey.  Yes,'' she said, ` I must get a watch-dog.
But he won't bark at you.'' And, going into the other drawing-rooma, she
sate down to the piano, and began to sing little Freneh songs in such a
charing, thrilling voice, that the mollified nobleman speedily followed
her into that chamber, and might be seen nodding his head and bowing
time over her.
Radon and lis friend meanwhile played ecare until they had enough.
The Colonel won; but, say that he won ever ao much and often, nights

domestic remained in Mr. Crawley's fanily, and when the renchwsoman

ack to the company when he found that honest Dolly was consoling the
child. The Colonel's dressing-room was in those upper regions. He used
to scee the boy there in private. They had intervicws together every
morning when he shaved; Rawdon minor sitting on a box by his fnther's
side and watching the operation with never ceasing pleasure. le and
the sire were great friends. The father would bring him sweet-meats from
the lessert, anl hile them in a certain old epaulet box, where the child
went to seek them, and Iaughed with joy on discovering the treasure:
Iaughed, but not oo loud: for mamma was blow asleep and must not
be listurbed. She did not go to rest till very lte, and seldom rose
till after noon.
Rawlon bought the boy plenty of picture-books, and crammedl his
ursery with toys. Its walls were coverel with pictures pasted up
by the father's own hand, and purchased by him for ready money.
When he was of duty with Mrs. Rawdon in the Prk, he would sit up
here, passing hours with the boy; who rode on his chest, who pulled his
great mustachios ns if they were driving-rcins, and spent duays with him
in indefatignuble gnmbols. The room was a low room, and once, when the
child was not five years old, his fatler, who was tossing him wildly up in
his arms, hit the poor little chap's skull so violently against the ceiling
that he almost dropped the child, so terrified was he at the disaster.
Rawdon minor had made up his fce for a tremendous howl-the
severity of the blow indeed authorised tlat indulgence: but just as le
wns going to begin, the father interposed.
`For God's sake, Rawdy, don't wake mamma,'' he cried. Ad the
child looking in a very hard and piteous way at his father, bit his lips,
clenched his lands, and didn't cry a bit. Rnwdon told tht story nt the
clubs, at the mess, to everyody in town. ` By Gad, Sir,'' he explained
to the public in general, `` what a good plucked one that boy of mine is-

boy, who looked up from his dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was
painting. Wen sle left the room, an odour of rose, or some other magical
fragrance lingered abont the nursery. She was an unearthly being in his
eyes, supcrior to his father-to all the world: to be worshipped and
ndmired at a distance. To drive with that lady in the carriage was an
awful rite: he sate up in the back seat, and did not dare to speak: he gazed
with all his eyes nt the besutifully dressed princess opposite to him.
Gentlemen on splendid prancing horses came up, and smilel and talkel

One Sunay moruing, as Rawvdon Crawley, his littlc son, and the pony
were taking their accustomed walk in the Park, they passed by an old
aequaintancee of the Colonel's, Corporal Clink, of the reginent, who was in
conversetion with a friend, nn oll gentleman, who held a boy in his
arms about the age of little Rawdon. This other youngster had seized
hold of the Waterloo mclal which the Corporal wore, and was examining
it with delight.
 Good morning, your Honour,'' snid Clink, in reply to the '` How-do,
Clink2'' of the Colonel.  This ere young gentlcman is about the little
Colonel's age, Sir,'' continuel the Corporal.
His fathcr was a Waterloo man, too,'' said the old gentleman, who
carried the boy. :Wasn't he, Georgy ?''
 es,'' said Georgy. lIe and the little chap on the pony were looking
at each other with all their might-solemnly seanning cach other as
children do.
 In a line regiment,'' Clink said with a patronising air.
IIe was a Captain in the -th regiment,'' snid the old gentlcman
rather pompously, Cnptain Gcorge Osborne, Sir-perhaps you knew
him. He diel the death of a hero, Sir, figlting against the Corsicnn
tyrant.''
Colonel Crawley blushed quite red. `I kuew him very well, Sir,'' hc
said, '` and his wife, his dear little wife, Sir-how is she?''
She is my daughter, Sir,'' said the old gentleman, pulling down the
boy, and taking out a card with great soleuity, wlich he handel to the
Colonel. On it was written-
MrF. Sedley, Sole Agent for the Black Diamond and Anti-Cinder Coal
Association, Buuker's Wharf, Thames Street, and hnua-MIaria Cottages,

Litle Georgy went up and lookel at tle Shetland pony.

Yes,'' said Georgy. The Colonel, who had been looking at him with
some interest, took up the child and put him on the pony belind Rawdon
ninor.
Take hold of him, Georgy,'' he said-`` take my little boy round the
waist-his name is Rawdon.'' And both the children began to laugh.
 Yonu won't see a prettier pair, I think, tli summer's day, Sir,'' said the
good-natured Corporal; and the Colonel, the Corporal, and old Mr. Sedley
with his umbrella, walked by the side of the children.

Our worthy fat friend Joseph
Sedley returned to India not
long after his escape from Brussels. Eithcr his furlough was up, or he
dreaded to meet any witnesses of his Waterloo flight. HIowever it might
be, he went back to his duties in Bcngal, very soon after Napoleon had
taken up his residence at Suint Helena, where Jos saw the ex-emperor.
To heasr Mr. Sedley talk on board slip you would have supposed that it
was not the first time he and the Corsican had met, nnd that the civilian
had bearded the French General nt Mount St. John. He had a thousand
anecdotes about the famous bttles; he knew the position of eery regi-
ment, and the loss which each had incurred. He did not deny tlat he
had been concerned in those victories-that he had been with the ary,
and carried dispatches for the bDuke of Wellington. And he deseribel
what the Duke did and snil on every conceivable moment of the day of
Waterloo, with such an accurate knowlelge of his Grace's sentiments and
proceedings, that it was clear he must have been by the conqueror's sidc
throughout the day; though, as a non-combatant, his name was not men-
tioned in the public documents relative to the battle. Perhaps he actually
worked himself up to believe that he had been engaged with tle army;
certain it is that he made na prodigious sensation for some time at Calcutta,
and was callel Waterloo Selley during the whole of his subsequent stay
in RBengal.
Thle bills which Jos had given for the purchase of those unlucky horses
wcre paid without question by him and his agents. He never was heard
342
vANITY FAII.
to allude to the bargain, and noboly knows for n certainty what becamc
of the horses, or ow he got rid of them, or of Isidor, his Belgian servant,
who sold a grey horse, very like the one which Jos rode, at Valencicnnes
sometime during the autumn of 1815.
Jos's London agents had orders to pay one hundred nnd twenty pounds
yearly to his parents at Fulham. It wns the chief support of the old
couple; for Mr. Sedley's speculations in life subsequent to his bankruptey
did not by any means retrieve the broken old gentleman's fortune. He
tried to be a wine-merchant, a coal-merchant, n commission-lottery agent,
kc., &c. He sent round prospectuses to his friends whenever he took a
new trade, and ordered a new brass plate for the door, and talked pomp-
ously nbout making his fortune still. But Fortune never came back to the
feeble and stricken old mun. One by one his friends dropped off, and
were wenry of buying dear conls and bnd wine from him; and there was
only his wife in all the world who fancied, wlen he tottered off to thce city
of a morning, that he was still doing any business there. At evening he
erawled slowly back; nnd he usel to go of nights to a little club at a
tavern, where he disposed of the finances of the nation. It was wonder-
ful to hear him talk about millions, and agios, nnd discounts, and what
Rothschill was doing, and Baring Brothers. He talked of such vast
sums that the gentlemen of the club (the apothecary, the undertaker, the
great carpenter and builder, the parish elerk, who was allowed to come
stealthily, and Mr. CIapp, our old aequaintance) respected the old geutle-
man. I was better off once, Sir,'' he did not fail to tell eerybody who
`used the room.'  My son, Sir, is at this minute chief magistrate of
Ramgunge in the Presidency of Bengal, and touching his four thousand
rupees per mensem. My daughter might be a Colonel's lady if she liked.
I might draw upon my son, the first magistrate, Sir, for two tlonsand
pound to-morrow, nnd Alexander would cnsh my bill, down Sir, down onthe
counter, Sir. But the Sedleys were alwnys n proud family.'' You and I,

Had Mrs. Sedley been a woman of energy, she would hae exerted it

house lndlady's husband; the Munoz of private life; the titular lord
and master: the carer, house-steward, and humble husband of the occupier
of the dingy throne. I lave seen men of good brins and breeding, and
of good hopes and vigour once, who feasted squires nd kept hunters in
their youth, meekly cutting up legs of mutton for rancorous old harridans,
nnd pretending to presido oer their drenry tables-but Mrs. Sedley, we
sny, had not spirit enough to bustle about for ``'a few select inmates to
join n cleerful musicnl family,'' such as one reads of in the Tmes. She
was content to lio on thc shore where fortune had stranded ler-and
you could see that thc career of this old couple was over.
I don't think they were unhappy. Perhaps they were a little prouder
in their dlownfall thau in their prosperity. Mrs. Sedley was always a
great person for her lanudlady, Mrs. Clapp, when she descened and passed
many hours with her in the basement or oramentel kitchen. The Irish
maid Betty Flanagan's bonnets and ribbons, hcr sauciness, her idleess,
her reckless prodigality of kitchen candles, ler consumption of tea and
sugar, and so forth, occupied and amused the old lady alost as much as
tle doings of her former houselold, when she had Sambo nnd the coachi-
man, and a groom and n footboy, and a lousekeeper with a regiment of
female domestics-her former household, about which the good lady talked
a hundred times u-day. And besides Betty EFlanagan, Mrs. Sedley had
nll the maids-of-all-work in the street to superintend. She knew how
each tenant of the cottages paid or owel his little rent. She stepped
aside when Mrs. Rougemont the actress paseed with her dubious family.
She flung up her head when Mrs. Pestler, the apothecary's laly, drove by
in her husband's professional one-horse chaise. She had colloquies with
the green-grocer about the pennorth of turnips which Mr. Sedley loved:
she kept an eye upon the milkman, and the baker's boy: nnd made visita-
tions to the butcher, who sold hundreds of oxen very likely with less ado
than was made about Mrs. Selley's loin of mutton: and she countedt the
potatoes under the joint on 3undays, on which days, drest in her best, she
went to church twice and read Blair's Sermons in the eening.
On that day, for ``business'' prevented him on week days from tking
such a pleasure, it wns old Sedley's delight to take out his little grnndson
Georgy to the neighbouring Parks or Kensington Gardens, to sce the
soldicrs, or to feed the lucks. Georgy loved the red-cots, and his
grandpapa told him how his father had been a famous soldier, and
introduced him to many scrgents and others with WYaterloo melnls on
their breasts, to whom the old grandfather pompously presented the child
as the son of Captain Osborne of .the -th, who died gloriously on the
glorious cighteenth. IIe has been known to treat some of these non-e
commissionel gentlemen to a glass of porter, and, indeed, in their first
Sunday walks was disposed to spoil little Georgy, sadly gorging the boy
with apples and purliament, to the detriment of his heulth-until Amelia
declared that George should never go out with his grandpapa, unless the
latter promised solemnly, and on his honour, not to give tle child any
cakes, lollipops, or stall produce whaterer.
Between Mrs. Sedley and her daughter there was a sort of coolness
about this boy, and a secret jealousy-for one evening, in George's ery

early dasys, Amelia, who had been seated at work in their little parlour
scarcely remarking that the old lady had quitted the room, ran up astairs
instinctively to the nursery at the eries of the child, who had been asleep
until that moment-and there found Mrs. Sedlley in the act of surrepti-
tiously administering Daffy's Elixir to the infant. Amelia, the gentlest
and sweetest of every-day mortals, when she found tis meddling with
her maternal authority, thrilled and trembled ull over with anger. Her
cheeks, ordinarily pale, now flushed up, until they were as red as they used
to be when she was a child of twelve years old. She seized the baby out
of her mother's arms, and then grasped at the bottle, lcaving the old
laly gaping at her, furious, and holding the guilty tea-speon.

Amelia flung the bottle crashing into the fire-place. ` I will not hase baby
poisoned, Mamma,'' cried Emmy, roeking the infant about violently with
both her arms round him, and turning with flashing eyes at her mother.
Poisoned, Amelial'' sail the old lady; `' this language to me''
He shall not have any medicine but that which Mr. Pestler sends
for him. He told me that Daffy'as Elixir was poison.''
Very good: you think I'm a murderess, then,'' replied Mrs. Sedley.
t This is the langunge you use to your mother. I have met with
misfortunes : I have sunk low in life: I hae kept my carriage, and now
walk on foot : but I did not know I was a murderess before, and thank
you for the nees.''

 Mamma,'' nid the poor girl, who was always ready for tears-`` you
shouldn't be hard upon me. I-I didn't mean-I mean, I did not wish
to say you would do any wrong to this dear child; only-''
O, no, my love-only that I was a murderess; in which case, I had
better go to the Old Bailey. Though I didn't poison yov, when you werea

money could procure. es; I've nursed five children, and buried three;
and the one I lovel tle best of all, and tended through croup, nn teething,

I never hnd when I was a girl-when I was too glad to honour my father
and mother, that I might live long in the land, and to be useful, and not
to mope all day in my room and act the fine lady-says I'm a murderess.
Ah, Mrs. Osborne! may you never nourish n viper in your bosom, that's
my prayer.
Mamma, Mammal'' eried the bewildered girl: and the child in her
arms set up a frantic chorus of shouts.
`A murderess, indeed1 Go lown on your knees and pray to Got to
cleanse your wicked uugrateful heart, Amclia, and may IIe forgive you as I
do;'' and Mrs. Sedley tossed out of the room, hissing out the word poison,
onee more, and so ending her charitanble beneliction.
Till the termination of her ntural life, tlis breach between Mrs. Sedley
and her daughter was never thoroughly mended. The quarrel gavc the
elder laly numberless advantages which she did not fail to turn to account
with female ingenuity and perseverancc. For instance, shc scnrcely spoke
to Mmelia for many weeks afterwards. She warned the domestics not to
toneh the echild, as Mrs. Osborne might he offendel. She asked her daughter
to see and satisfy herself that there was no poisen prepared in the little
daily messes that were concocted for Georgy. When neighbours asked
after the boy's henlth, she relferred them pointedly to Mrs. Osborne. Sla
never ventured to ask whether the bay was wcll or not. Sle wonld not
touch the child although he was her grndson, and own precious darling,
for she was not used to children, and miglt kill it. Mnd wlenever Mr.
Pestler came upon his healing inquisition, she received the Doctor with
such n sarcastic and scornful demeanour, as made the surgcon declare that
not Lady Thistlewood herself, whom he had the honour of attending pro-
fessionally, eould give herself greater airs than old Mrs. Sedley, from
whom he never took a fee. And very likely Emmy was jealous too, upon
her own part, as what mother is not, of tlose who would manage her
children for her, or become candidutes for the first place in their auffeetions '
It is certain that when anybody nursed the child, she was uneasy, and
that she would no more nllow Mrs. Clapp or the lomestic to dress or tend
him, than she would have let them wash her lusband's miniature which
hung up over er little bed;-the same little bel from which the poor girl
had gone to his; and to which she retirel now for many long, silent, tcarful,
but happy years.
In this room was all Amelia's heart and treasure. Here it wns that she
tended her boy, and wntched him through the many ills of childhood, with
n constant passion of love. The elder George returned in him somehow,

only improved, and as if come back from heaen. In n hundred little tones,
looks, and movements, the echild was so like his father, that the widow's
heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would often ask the csuse
of her tears. It was because of his likeness to his father, she did not
scruple to tell him. She talked constantly to him ahout this dead father,
and spoke of her love for George to the innocent and wondering child;
much more than she eer had done to George himself, or to any confidante
of her youth. To her parents she neer talked about this matter: shrink-
ing from baring her heart to them. Little George ery likely could under-
stand no better than the; but into his ears she poured her sentimental
secrets unreservedly, and into his only. The very joy of this woman was
a sort of grief, or so tender, at least, that its expression was tears. Her
sensihilities were so weak and tremulous, that perhaps they ought not to
be talked about in a book. I was told by Dbr. Pestler, (now a most
flourishing lady's physician, with a sumptuous dark-green carriage, a pros-
pect of speedy knighthood, and a house in Manchester quare,) that her
grief at weaning the child was a sight that would have unmanned a Herod.
He was very soft-hearted many yenrs ago, and his wife was mortally jealous
of Mrs. Amelia, then and long afterwards.
Perhaps the Doctor's lady had good reason for her jealousy: most
women shared it, of those who formed the small circle of Amelia's
aequaintance, and were quite angry at the enthusiasm with whioh the
other sex regarded her. For almost all men who came nenr her loved
her; though no doubt they would be at n loss to tell you why. She was
ot brilliant, nor witty, nor wise overmueh, nor extraordinarily handsome.
But whereer she went she touched and charmed eery one of the male
sex, as invuariably as she awakened the scorn and inerelulity of her own
sisterhood. I think it was her weakess which was her principal charm:-
a kind of sweet submission and softness, which seemed to appeal to each
mnn she met for his sympathy and protection. We have seen how in the
regiment, though she spoke but to few of George's comrades there, all the
swords of the young fellows at the mess-table would have leapt from their
scnbburds to fight round her: and so it was in the little narrow lodging-
house and cirele of Fulham, she interested and pleased everybody. If she
had been Mrs. Mango herself, of the great house of Mango, Plantain, and
Co., Crutched RFriars, and the magnificent proprietress of the Pineries,
ulham, who gavre summer dieines frequented by Dukes and Earls, and
drove about the parish with magnificent yellow lieries and bay horses,
such as the royl stables at Hensington themseles could not turn out-I
say had she been Mrs. Mango herself, or her ason's wife, Lady Mary
Mango, (daughter of the Earl of Castlemouldy, who condeseended ta
marry the heal of the firm,) the tradesmen of the neighbourhood could
not pay her more honour than they invariably showed to the gentle young
widow, when she passed by their doors, or made her humble purchses at
their shops.
Thus it was not only Mr. Pestler, the medical man, but Mr. Linton, the
young assistant, who doctored the servant maids and small tradesmen,
and might be seen any day reading the Times in the surgery, who openly
deelared himself the slavo of Mrs. Osborne. He ws a personable young

gentleman, more welcome at Mrs. Sedley's lodgings than his principal;
and if anything went wrong with Georgy, he would drop in twice or thrice
in the day, to see the little chap, and without so much as the thought of
a fee. He would abstract lozenges, tamarinds, and other produce from the
surgery-drawers for little Georgy's benefit, nnd compounded draughts and
mixtures for him of miraculous sweetnuess, so that it wns quite a pleasure
to the child to be ailing. IIe and Pestlcr, his chief, sate up two whole
nights by the boy in that momentous nand awful week wheu Georgy had
the measles; and when you would have thought, from the mother's terror,
that there had never been mesles in te world before. Would they have
done as much for other people id they sit up for the folks nt the
Pineries, when Ralph Plantagenet, nnd Gwendoline, and Guinever Mango
had the same juvenile complaintP Did they sit up for little Mnry Clapp,
ths landlord's daughter, who actually caught the disease of little Georgy'
Truth compels one to say, no. They slept quite undisturbed, at lenst as
far as she was concerned-pronounced hers to be a slight cnse, which
would nlmost cure itself, sent her in n draught or two, and threw in buark
when the ehild ralliel, with perfect indifference, nnd just for form's sake.
Again, there was the little French chevalier opposite, who gave lessons
in his native tongue at various schools in the neighbourhood, amnd who
might be heard in his apartment of nights playing tremulous old guvottes
and minuets, on a wheezy old fidlle. Whenever this powdered and
courteous old man, who never missed a Sunday at the convent chapel at
Hammersmith, and who was in all respeets, thoughts, conduct, and bear-
ing, utterly unlike the bearled savages of his nution, who curse perfidious
Albion, and seowl at you from over their cignrs, in the uadrunt arcades
at the present day,-whenever the old Chevalier de Talonrouge spoke of
Mistress Osborne, he would first finish his pinch of snuff, flick awsy the
remaining particles of dust with a graceful wnve of his hand, gatler up
his fingers again into as bnnch, and, bringing thm up to his mouth, blow
them open with a kiss, exelaiming, Al, la dioine creture I IIe vowed and
protested that when Amelia walked in the Brompton Lnnes flowers grew
in profusion under her feet. He called little Georgy Cupid, nnd asked him
news of Yenus, his mamma ; and told the astonished Betty Flanagun that
she was one of the Graces, and the fuavourite attendant of the Reine des
fmora.
Instanees might be multiplied of this ensily gained and unconscious
popularity. Did not Mr. Binny, the mild and genteel urate of the district
chapel, which the family attended, call assiduously upon the widow, dandle
the little boy on his knee, and offer to teach him Lntin, to the anger of the
elderly virgin, his sister, who kept house for him2 There is nothing in
her, Bcilby,'' the latter lady would sny.  When she comes to tea here
she does not speak a word during the whole evening. She is but a poor
lackadaisicnl ereature, and it is my belief has no heart nat all. It is only
her pretty face which all you gentlemen admirc so. Miss Grits, who has
five thousand pounds and exrpectations besides, has twice as much character,
and is a thousaud times more agreeable to my taste; and if she were good-
looking lI know that you would think her perfection.''
Very likely Miss Binny was right to a great extent. It is the pretty

face which creates sympathy in the hearts of men, those wickel rogues.
A woman may possess the wisdom and chastity of Minerva, and we gie
no heed to hcr, if she has a plain face. Whnt folly will not a pair of bright
eyes make pardonahleP What dullness may not red lips and sweet aceents
render pleasant And so, with their usual sense of justice, ladies argue
that because a woman is handsome, therefore she is a fool. Oh ladies,
ladiesl some there are of you who are neither handsome nor wise.
These are but trivial incidents to recount in the life of our heroine.
Her tale does not deal in wonders, as the gentle reader has already no
oubt perceivel; and if a jounal had been kept of her proceedings during
the seven years after the birthi of her son, tlere would be found few inci
dents more remarkable in it than that of the measles, recorded in the fore-
ging page. Ies, one day, and greatly to her wonder, the Reverend MIr.
Binny just mentioned, asked her to change her name of Osborne for his
own; when, with deep blushes, and tears in her eyes and voice, she
thanked him for his regard for her, expressed gratitude for his attentions
to her and to her poor little boy, but said that she never, neer could think
of any but-but the husband wlom she had lost.

(nnd we do not know how many hours of solitary night-thought, her littlo
boy sleeping in his crib by her bed-side) to the memory of that departed'
friend. bDuring the day she wns more actise. She had to teach George to
read and to write, and a little to draw. She read books, in order thast she
miglt tell him stories from them. As his eycs opened, and his mind
expanded, under the influence of the outward nnture round about him, she
taught the child, to the best of her humble power, to acknowledge the
Maker of all; and every night and every morning he and slc-(in thnt
anwful nnd touching communion which I think must bring a thrill to the
henrt of every man who witnesses or who remembers it)-the mother nnd
the little boy-prayed to Our Father together, the mother pleading with
all her gentle heart, the child lisping after as she spoke. And each time
they prayed to God to bless dear papa, as if he were alive and in the room
with them.
To wash and dress this young gentleman-to take him for n run of the
mornings, before breakfast, and the retreat of grandpupa for'`busincss''--
to make for him the most wonderful and ingenious dresses, for which end
the thrifty widow cut np and altered every nvailable little bit of fiuery
which she possessed out of her wardrobe during her marriage-for Mrs.
Osbore herself, (greatly to her mother's vexation, who preferred fine clothes,
especially since her misfortuncs) always wore n black gown, aud n straw
bonnet with a blaek ribbon-oceupied her many hours of the dny. Others
she had to spare, at the service of her mother nnd her old father. She had
taken the pains to learn, and used to play eribbage with this gentleman on
the nights when he did not go to his clb. She sang for him when he was
so minded, and it was a good sign, for he invriably fell into a comfortable
sleep during the music. She wrote out his numerous memorials, letters,
prospectuses, and projects. It was in her hand-writing tht most of thc
old gentleman's former acquaintances were informed that he hnd become
an ngent for the BIaek Diamond and Anti-Cinder Coal Company, and
could supply his friends and the public with the best coals at -s. pe
chaldron. All he did was to sign the circulars with his flourish and signu-

was sent to Major Dobbin, - Regt., cnre of Messrs. Cox and Greenwood;

growths of ports, sherries, and claret wines at reasonable prices, and under

everybody whom he knew in thePresidency, and sent home to Sedley nnd
Co. orders for wine which perfectly astonishcd Mr. Sedley and Mr. Clapp,

first burst of goo fortune, on which poor old Osborne was about to build

dents all over the world. The old gentleman's former taste in wine had

gone: the curscs of the mess-room assailed MIajor Dobbin for the vile
drinks he had been the means of introducing tlere; and he bought bck
a great quantity of the wine, und sold it at public outcry, at an eormous
loss to himself. As for Jos, who was by this time promoted to a seat at
the Revenue Board at Calcutta, he was wild with rage when the post
brouglt him out a bundle of these Bacehnalian prospectuses, with a
private uote from his father, telling Jos that his senior counted upon him
in this enterprise, and had oonsigned a quantity of seleet wines to him, as
per invoice, drawing bills upon him for the amount of the same. Jos, who
would uo more have it supposed that his father, Jos Sedley's father, of
the Board of Revenue, was a wine merchant asking for orders, than that
hc was Juaek Ketch, refused the bills wit seorn, wrote baek contueliously
to te old gentleman, bidding lim to mind his own affairs; and the pro-
tested papcr coming back, Sedley and Co. had to take it up with the
profits which they had made out of the Madras venture, and with a little
portion of Lmmy's savings.
Besides ler pension of fifty pounds a-year, there had been five hundred
pounds, as her husband's executor stated, lelt in the agent's hands at the
time of Osborne's demise, which sum, as George's guardian, Dobbin pro-
posed to put out at  per cent. in an Indian houso of agency. Mr.
Sedley, who thought the Major had some roguish intentions of his own
about te money, was strongly against this plan; and he went to the agenta
to protest personally against the employment of the money in question, when
he learned, to his surprise, that there had been no such sum in their
hands, that all the late Captaiu's assets did not amount to a lndred pounds,
and that the five hundred pounds in question must be a separate sum, of
which Major Dolbin kuow the partioulars. More than ever convinced
that there was some roguery, old Seley pursued tho Major. As his
daughter's nearest friend, he demanded, with a high hand, a statement of
the late Captain's aecounts. Dobbin's stammering, blushing, and
awkwardness added to the other's convictions that he had a rogue to deal
with; and in a jestic tone he toll that officer a piece of his mind, as he
called it, simply stating his bclief tlut the Major was unlawfully detaining
his late son-in-laws money.
Dobbin at this lost all pationce, and if his accuser hnd not been so old
nnd so broken, a quarrel might have ensued between them at the Slaughter
Coffee-house, in a box of which place of entertainment the gentleen had
their colloquy. ``Come up stairs, Sir,'' lisped out the Major. :I
insist on your coming up the stairs, and I will show which is the
injured party, poor George or I;'' and, dragging the old gentloman up to
his bed-room, he produced from his desk Osborne's aceount, and a bundle
ofI O U's which the latter hnl given, who, to do him justice, was always

paid all the fees and charges incideut upon the calamity and removal of
poor Amelia.
About these expenses oll Osborne had never given himself any trouble
to think, nor any other relative of Amelia, nor Amelia hersell, indeed.
She trusted to Major Dobbin as an aecountant, took his somewhat con-
fused calculations for granted: and never once suspected how much she
was in his debt.
Twice or thriee in the year, aceording to her promise, she wrote him
letters to Madras, letters all about little Georgy. Iow le treasured these
papersl Whenever Amalia wrote he answered, anl not until then. lBut
he sent over endless remembrances of himself to his godson and to her.
He ordered and sent a box of scnrfs, and a grand ivory set of chess-men
from China. he pawns were little green and wlite men, with real swords
and shields; the knights were on horseback, the castles were on the backs
of elephants. : Mrs. Mango's own set at the Pineries was uot so fine,''
Mr. Pestler remarked. These chess-men were the delight of Georgy's
life, who printed his first letter in acknowledgment of this gift of his
godpapa. He sent over preserves and piokles, wlich latter the young
gentleman tried surreptitiously in the sideboard, and half-killed himsell
with eating. He thought it was a julgment upon him for stealing, thcy

Major: it pleasel him to think that her spirits were rllying, and that she
eould be merry sometimes now. le sent over a pair of shawls, n white
one for her, and a black one with palm-leaves fcr hcer mother, antd a pair
of red scearfs, as winter wrappers, for old Mr. Sedley and George. The
shawls were worth fifty guineas a picce at the very least, as Mrs. Selley
knew. She wore hers in state at church at rompton, and was congratu-
lated by her female friends upon the splenlid acquisition. Emmy's, too,
became prettily her modest black gown. `What a pity it is she wont tlink
of him,'' Mrs. Selley remarked to Mrs. Clapp, and to all her friends of
Brompton. ``Jos never sent us such presenuts, I am sure, and grudges us
eerything. It is evident that the Mlajor is over head and ears in love
with her: and yet, whcnever I so much ns lint it, she turns red and bcgins
to cry, and goes and sits up stairs with her miniature. Im sick of
that miniature. I wish we had neer seen those odious purse-proud
Osbornes,''
-Amidst such humble seenes and associates George's early youth was
passed, and the boy grew up delicate, sensitive, imperious, woman-brel-
domineering the gentle mother whom he loved with passionate affection.
He ruled all the rest of the little world round about him. As he grew, the
elders were amazed at his haughty manner and his constant likeness to lis
father. He asked questions about eerything, as inquiring youth will do.
The profundity of his remarks nnd iuterrogatorics astonished his old
grandfather, who perfectly ored the club at the tavern with stories about
the little lad's learning und genius. He suffered his granlmother witha
good-humoured indifference. The small circle round about hin believel

nnd hopel he would acquit himself with eredit there: or would he have a
good tutor at home it was time that he should begin to leaurn; nnd his
godfather anl guardian hintel that he hoped to be allowed to defray the
charges of the boy's edueation, which would fall heasvily upon his mother's
straitened income. The Mjor, in a word, wns always thinking about
Amelia and her little boy, and by orders to his agents kept the latter pro-
viled with picture-books, paint-boxes, desks, and all conceivable imple-
ments of amusement and instruction. Three days before George's sixth
birth-dsy, a gentleman in a gig, aeeompanied by a servant, droe up tao
Mr. Sedley's house, and asked to see Master George Osborne : it was
Mr. Woolsey, military tailor, of Conduit Street, who came at the Major's
order to measure the young gentleman for a suit of eloth clothes. He had
had the honour of making for the Cnptsin, the young gentleman's father.
Sometimes too, and by the Major's desire no doubt, his sisters, the
Misses Dobbin, would call in the family carriage to take Amelia and the
little boy a drive if they were so inclined. The patronage and kindness
of these lalies was very uncomfortable to Amelia, but she bore it meekly
enough, for her nature was to yield; and, besides, the carriage and its
splendours gave little Georgy immenee pleasure. The ladies begged
oceasionally that the child migkt pass s day with them, and he was always
glad to go to that fine garden-house at Denmark Hill, where they lived,
and where there were such fine grapes in the hot-houses ad peaches on
the walls.

sure would dclight ler-something ery interesting about their dear

when she put tle child down ; and she scaroely spoke a word during the
whole of the drive-though she was so very happy indeed.

cHAPTER XXXIX.
A cYICAL CHANTER.
UR duty now takes us back for a brief space to
some old Hampshire aequaintances of ours,
whose hopes respeeting the disposal of thcir
rich kinswoman's property were so wofully
disappointed. After counting upon thirty
thousand pounds from his sister, it was a
heavy blow to Bute Crawley to reccive but
five; out of which sum, when he had paid
his own debts and those of Jim, his son at
college, a very small fragment remained to
portion off his four plain daughters. MIrs.
Bute never knew, or nt least never ucknowledged, how fur ler own tyruan-
nous behaviour had tended to ruin her husband. All that womnn could
do, she vowed and protested she had done. Was it her fault if slc did
not possess those syeophantic arts which er hypoecritical ncphew, itt
Crawley, practised' She wished him all the happiness which he meritcd
out of his ill-gotten gins. ''At least ths money will remain in the
family,'' she sid, charitably.  Pilt wiil never spen it, my dear, that
is quite certain; for a greater miser does not exist in England, and he is
as odious, though in a different way, as his spendthuift brther, the
abandoned Rawdon,''
So Mrs. Bute, after the first shoek of rage and disappointment, began
to accommodate herself as best she could to her altered fortunes, and to
savse and retrench witl nll her might. She instrueted her ulaughters how
to bear poverty cheerfully, and invented a thousand notable methods to
conceal or cvade it. She took them about to balls and public places in
the neighbourhood, with praiseworthy energy; nay, she entertained hcr
friends in a hospitable comfortable manner at the Rectory, and much more
frequently than before dear Miss Crawley's legsey had fallen in. From
her outward bearing nobody would have supposed that the family hud
been disappointed in their expectations: or have guessed from her frequent
appearance in publie how she pincled and starved at home. Her girls
had more milliner's furniture than they hnd ever enjoyel before. They
appeared perseveringly at the Winechester and Southampton assemblies;
they penetrated to Cowes for the race-alls and regatta-guieties there ; and
their carriage, with the horses taken from the plough, was at work per-
petually, until it began almost to be believed that the four sisters had had
fortunes left them by their aunt, whose name the family ever mentionel

in publie but with the most tender gratitude and regard. I know no sort
of lying which is more frequent in Vanity Fair than this;: and it may be
remarked how people who praetise it take credit to themselves for their
hypocrisy, and fancy that they are exceedingly virtuous and praiseworthy,
because they are able to deceive the world with regard to the extent of
their means.
Mrs. Bute certainly thought herself one of the most virtuous won en
in England, and the sight of her happy family was an edifying one to
strangers. They were so cheerful, so loving, so well-educated, so simplel

What will not a mother do for the benefit of her beloved ones ?
Between such a woman and her hrother-in-law, the odious Baronet at
the IInall, it is manifest that therc could be very little in common. The
rupture between Bute and his brother Sir Pitt was complete; indeed,
between Sir Pitt and the whole county, to which the old man mas a
ascandal. His dislike for respectable society inereased with age, and the
lolge-gates had not opened to a gentleman's carriage-wheels since Pitt
and ILady Jane came to puy their visit of duty after their marriage.
That was an awful and unfortunate visit, never to be thought of by the
family withont horror. Pitt begged his wife, with a ghastly countenancc,
never to speak of it; and it was only through Mrs. Bute herself, who till
kne everything which took plaee at tle Hall, that the circumstances of
Sir Bute's reception of his son and daughter-in-law were ever known
at nll.
As they drove up the avenue of the Park in their neat and well-appointed
carriage, lPitt remarked with dismay and wrath great gaps among the trees
-his trees,-which the old Baronet was felling entirely without license.
The park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin. The drives were ill
kept, and the neat carriage splashed and foundered in muddy pools along
the road. The great swcep in front of the terrace nnd entrance stair was
black and covered with mosses; thc once trim flower-bcls rank and weedy.
Shutters were up along almost thc whole line of the house; the geat hall-
oor wvas unbarred aufter much ringing of the bell; an individual in ribbons
was seen litting up the blaek oak stair, as Horrocks at length admitted
the heir of ueen's Crawley and his brile into thc halls of their futhers.

Hle lel the way into Sir Pitts `' Library,'' as it was called, the fumes of
tobaceo growing strouger as Pitt and Lady Jane approached that apart-
ment. Sir Pitt ain't very well, Horrocks remarked apologetically, anl
hinted that his master was aflieted with lumbugo.
The library looked out on the front walk and purk. Sir Pitt had
opened one of the windows, and was bawling out thence to the postillion

said he, `` my dear; it belonged to my mother, and afterwards to the first

 What hae you a been and given Pitt's wite'' said tle individual in
ribbons, when Pitt and Lndy Jane had taken leave of the old gentleman.
It was Miss HIorrocks, the butler's langhter-tle cause of the seandal
throughout the country-the lady whlo reigned ow almost supreme at
ueen's Crawley.
The rise and progress of those Ribbons had been marked with dismay
by the county and family. The ibbons opened an acount at the MIud-
bury Branch Savings Bank; the Ribbons drove to Church, monopolising
the pony-chaise, which ws for the use of the servants at the Hall. The
domestics were lismissed at her pleasure. The Scotch gnrdener, who still
lingcered on the premises, taking a pride in his walls and hothouses, aud
indced making a pretty good livelihood by the garden, whieh he farmed,
nnd of which he soll the produce at Southampton, found the Ribbons
eating pcncles in n sunshiny morning at the south-wall, and had his cars
boxed, whcu he remonstrated about this attack on his property. He and
his Seotch wife anl his Scotch children, the only respectable inhabitauts of
ueen's Crawley, were forcel to migrate, with their goods and their chattels,
and left the statcely comfortable gardens to go to wuste, and the flower-
bels to run to secd. Poor Lady Crawley's rose-gnrden bccame the
dreariest wvilderness. Ouly two or three domestics shudderel in the bleak
old serant's hall. The stables and offices were vacant, and shut up, and
half ruined. Sir Pitt lived in priate, and boozed nightly with Horrocks,
his butler or house-stewarl (as he now began to be called), and the aban-
doned Ribbons. The times were very much changed since the period
when she drove to Mulbury in the spring-cart, and called the asmall
tradesmen '' Sir.'' It may have been shame, or it may have been dislike
of his ncighbours, but the old Cynic of ueen's Crwley hardly iasued
from his park-gates at all now. e quarrelled with his agents, and
screwed his tenants by letter. IIis days were past in conducting his own
correspondence ; the lawyers and farm-bailiffs, who had to do business with
him, could not reach him but through the Ribbons, who received them at
the door of the housekeeper's room, which commandedl the baek entrance
by which they were admitted; nd so the Baronet's daily perplexzities
increased, and his embnrrassments multiplied round him.
The orror of Pitt Crawley masy be imagined, as these reports of his
father's dotage reached the most exemplary and correct of gentlemen.
He trembled dnily lest he should hear that the Ribbons was proclaimed
his second legal mothier-in-law. After that first and last visit, his father's
name was never mentioned in Pitt's polite and genteel establishment. It
was the skeleton in his house, and all tle family walked by it in terror
and silence. The Countess Bouthdown kept on dropping per eoach at the

lodge-gate the most exciting traets, traets whieh ought to frighten the
hair ofl your head. Mrs. Bute at the pareonage nightly looked out to see
if the sky was red over the elms behind which the Hall stood, and the
mansion was on fire. Sir G. Wapshot and Sir H. Fuddlestone, old friends
of the house, would'nt sit on the bench with Sir Pitt at uarter Sessions,
and cut him dead in the High-street of Southampton, where the reprobate
stool offering lis dirty old hands to them. Nothing had any effect upon
him; he put his hands into lis pockets, and burst out laughing, as he
serambled into his carriage and four; he used to burst out lughing at
Lndy Southdown's tracts; and he Iaughed at his sons, anl at the world,
nnd ut the Ribhons when she was angry, which was not seldom.
Miss Horrocks was installed as housekeeper at ueen's Crley, and
ruled all the domestics there with great majcsty and rigour. All th
servants were instructed to address her ns ' Mum,'' or  Mudam''-nnd
there was one little maid, on hcr promotion, who persistedl in calling her
 My Lnly,'' without any rebuke on the part of the housekeeper. `There
has been better Indies, and there has been worser, Hester,'' was Miss
Horrocks' reply to this compliment of her inferior: so she ruled, having
supreme power over all except her fnther, whom, however, she treated
with considerable haughtiness, warning him not to be too familiar in his
behaviour to one ``ns was to be n Baronet's laly.'' Indeel, she rehenrsed
that exalted part in life with great satisfaction to herself, and to the
amusement of old Sir Pitt, who chucklel at her airs and graces, nnd
would laugh by the hour together at ler assumptions of dignity anl
imitations of genteel life. lIce swore it was as good as a play to see her in
the character of n fine dnme, and he made her put on one of the first Ludy
Craley's court-dresses, swearing, (entirely to Miss HIorrocks' own con-
currence,) that the dress became her prodigiously, nd thrcatening to
rive her off that very instant to Court in a coach-nnd-four. She had
the ransneking of the wrdrobes of the to defunct ladies, and cut and
haeked their posthumous finery so as to suit her own tastes and figure.
And she would have liked to take possession of their jewels anl triukets
too; but the old Baronet hnd locked them away in his private cnbinet, nor
could she coax or wheelle him out of the keys. And it is a fact, that
some time after she left ucen's Crawley a copy-book belonging to this
lady was discovered, which showed that she hmad tnken great pains in
private to lenrn the art of writing in general, nnd especially of writing her
own name as Lndy Crawley, Lady Betsy Horrocks, Lady Elizabeth
Crawley, &c.
Though the good people of the Parsonage never went to the Hall, and
shunned the horrid old dotard its owner, yet they kept a strict knowledge
of all that happened there, and were looking out every day for the cata-
strophe, for which Miss Horroeks was also eager. But Fate intervened
enviously, and prevented her from receiving the reward due to such
immaculate love and virtue.
One day the Baronet surprised ``her ladlyship,'' as he jocularly
cnlled her, seated at that old and tuneless piano in the drawing-room,
which hal scarcely been touched since Becky Sharp played quadrilles
upon it. Seated at the piano with the utmost gravity, and squalling

to the best of her power in imitation of the music which she had sometimes
heard. The little kitchen-maid on her promotion was standing at her
mistrese's side, quite delighted during the operation, ad agging her
head up and down, and crying '`Lor, Mum, 'tis bittiful,''-just like a
genteel sycophant in a real drawing-room.

This incident made the old Baronet roar with laughter, as usual. He
narrated the circumstanee a dozen times to Horrocks in the course of the
evening, and greatly to the discomfiture of Miss Horrocks. He thrummed
on the table as if it had been a musical instrument and squalled in imitation
of her manner of singing. He vowed that sueh a beautiful voice ought to
be cultivated, and declared she ought to have singing-masters, in which
proposals she saw nothing ridiculous. He was in great spirits that night;
and drank with his friend and butler an extraordinary quantity of rum-
and-water-at a very late hour the faithful friend and domestie conducted
his master to his bed-room.
Half an hour afterwarls tlere was a great hurry and bustle in the house.

Lights went about from window to window in the lonely desolate old Hnll,
whereof but two or three rooms were ordinarily oceupied by its owner.
Presently, a boy on a pony went galloping off to Mudbury, to the Doc-
tor's house there. And in another hour (by which fact we aseertain how
carefully the excellent Mrs. bBute Cruawley had always kept up an under-
standing with the great house), that lady in her clogs and calash, the
Reverend Bute Crawley, and James Crawley, her son, had walked over
irom the kectory through the prk, and had entered the mansion by
the open hall-door.
They passed through the hall and the small oak parlour, on the table of
which stool the three tumblers and the empty rum-bottle which had served
for Sir Pitt's carouse, and through thnt apartment into Sir Pitt's study,
where they found Mliss Horrocks, of the guilty ribbons, with a wild air,
trying at the presses and escritoires wit a bunch of keys. She dropped
them with a scream of terror, us little MIrs. Bute's cyes flushed out at her
from under her black calash.
`Look at thsat, James unl Mr. Crwvley,'' oried Mrs. Bute, pointing at
the scared tgure of the black-eyed, guilty wench.

Bear witness, Mr, Crwley, we found this good-Io-nothing woman in the

always said-ghewould.''
Betsy looeks quite dauntel, flung hcrself down on her kiees, bursting
into teas. ,lut tkgse who know a really good woman are nwire that
she is not i a hurry t forgive, aud that the huiliation of an enemy is
triumph to her soul.

and which she had just appropriated out of one of the bookcases in the

``And here 's a candle, Mum, and if you please, Mum, I can show you

keeps eaps nnd heaps of things, Mum,'' cried out the enger little Hester
with a profusion of curtscys.

she knew perfectly well.
Bute went up stairs, and found the Doctor from Mulbury, with the
frigltened Horrocks over his master in a chair. They were trying to
bleed Sir Pitt Crawley.
WGth the early morning an express was sent of to Mr. Pitt Crawley by
the ector's lady, who assumed the command of everything, and bad
watched the old Baronet through the night. He had been brought back
to a sort of life; he could not speak, but seemed to recognise people.
Mrs. Bute kept resolutely by his bed-sile. She never seemed to want to
sleep, tht little woman, and did not close her fiery blnck eyes once, though
the Doctor snored in the arm-chair. Horrocks made some wild eforts
to assert his authority and assist his mnster: but Mrs. Bute called him
n tipsy old wretch, nnd bade him never show his face agin in that house
or he should be transportel like his abominahle daughter.
Terrified by her manner he slunk down to the oak parlour where Mr.
James was, wlo, aving tried the bottle standing there and found no liquor
in it, ordered Mr. Horroeks to get another bottle of rum, which he
fetehed with clean glasses, and to which the Rector and his son sate down:
ordering Horrocks to put down the keys at that instant and never to show
lis face again.
Cowed by this behaviour Horroeks gare up the keys: and he and his
daughter slunk off silently though the night, and gae up possession ol
the house of Gueen's Crawley.

 IIE heir of Crswley arrived nt
=r f
home, in due time, after this
catustrophe, and henceforth may
be said to have reigned in
ueen's Crawley. or though
the old Baronet survived many
months, he never recovered thc
uso of lis intellect or his specch
completcly, and the government
of the estate devolved upon his
elder son. In a strange condition
Pitt found it. Sir Pitt was always
buying anl mortgaging: he had
twenty men of business, and
quarrels with each; quarrels with
ull his tenants, and lawsuits with
them ; lawsuite with the lawycrs;
lnwsuits with the Mining and
Dock Companies in which he was
proprietor; and with every person
with wlom he hnl business. 1o
unravel these lifficulties, nnl set the estate elear, was a task worthy of the
orderly and persevering diplomatist of Pumpernickel : and he set himself
to work with proligious assiduity. His whole fmily, of course, was
transported to ueen's Crawley, whither Lady Southdown, of course, canc
too,; and she set about converting the parish under the Rector's nose, and
brought down her irregular clergy to the dismay of the angry Mrs. Bute.
Sir Pitt had concluded no bargain for the snle of tho living of ucen's
Crawley; when it should drop, er Iayship propese to take the patroagse
into ler own hands, nnd present a young protege to the Rectory ; on which
subject the liplomatic Pitt said nothing.
Mrs. Bute's intentions with regard to Miss Betsy Horrocks were not
carried into effeet: and she paid no isit to Southampton Gaol. She
and her father left the Hall, when the lstter took possession of the
Crawley Arms in the illage, of which he had got a lease from Sii
itt. The ex-butler had obtained a small freehold there likewise, which
gave him a vote for the orough. Tle Reetor had another of these votes,
nnd these and four others formed the representatie body which returned
the two members for ueen's Crnwley.
3s2
vANIIY FAII.
Thcre was n show of courtesy kept up between tho Rectlory and the
1Hall ladies, between te younger oues at least, for Mrs. Bute and Lady
Southdown never could meet without batlles, and gradually ceased seeing
each utler. Her Ladyship kept her room when the ladies from the Rectory
visited their cousins at the IIall. Perhaps Mr. Pitt was not very much
displeased uat these occasional absences of his mamma-in-law. le believed
the Binkie fumily to be the greatest and wiscst, and most interesting in
the world, aud her Ladyship and his aunt had long leld ascendancy orer
him; but sometimes he felt that she commanded him too much. To be
considered young as complimentary doubtless; but at six-and-forty to be
treated as a boy was sometimes mortifying. ILady Jane yielded up every
thiug, howcver, to hcr mother. She was only fond of her children in
priate; and it was lucky for her that Lady Southdown's multifarious
business, her conferenees with inisters, and her correspondence with all
the issionaries of Africa, Asia, and hustralasin, &c. occupied the venerable
Countcss a great deal, so that she had but little time to devote to her
granldauguter, the little Matilda, and her grandson, Master Pitt Crawley.
1he latter was a feeble child: and it was only by prodigious quantities of
calomel that Lady Southlown was able to keep him in life at all.
As for Sir TPitt he retired into those very npartments where Lady
Crawley had bcen previously extinguished, and here was tended by Miss
Hester, the girl upon ler promotion, with constant care and assiduity.
What love, what fidelity, what constancy is there cqual to that of a nurse
with good wages: lhey sooth pillows: and make arrow-root: they get
up at ights: they bear complais anl qucrulousness: they see the sun
shining ot of doors anl doirtant lo go abrond : they sleep on arm-
clairs, and eat their mels in solitide: thy pass long long evenings doing
uothing, watching thce cubers, and te paticnt's driuk simmering in the
iyg: they rcad tle weelly paper tle whole week through; and ILaw'
Serious Call or le Wlole Iuty ol Mln sulfiees thiem for literuature for thce
year-and we qarrei wit tl bca, when their relations come to see
them once a wcek, :a Il gu is muggled in in their linen-basket.
Lndies, whct man's love is thlerc tat would stand a year's nursing of the
objccet of his aflection? Whereas a nirse will stand by you for ten pounds
a quarter, and we think her too highly pnid. At lcast Mr. Crawley grum-
bled a good deal about ping half as much to Mis Hester for her
constant attendance upon tk Baronet his father.
Of sunshiny days this old gentleman was-takcn out in a chair on the
terrace-tle very elair which Miss ey hd had at Brighton, and
whiech had been transported thence witfi a number of ILady Southlown's
elects to ueen's Crawley. Laly Jane ulways walked by the old man:
nnd was an evident favourite with him. Ie used to nod many times to
er and smile when she came in, and utter inarticulate deprecatory moans
when she was going away. Whwen tle door shut upon her he would cry
and sb-whereupon Hester's face and manner, whicl wns always exceed-
ingly bland and gentle while her lady was present, would change at once
and she would make faces at him, and clench her fist, and scream out
IIold your tongue, you stoopid old fool,'' and twirl away his chair from
the fire which he loved to look at-at which he would cry more. or

this was all that wns left after more than seventy years of cunning and
struggling, nnd drinking anl scheig, nd sin and selfishness-a whim-
pering old idiot put in and out of bed and cleanel and fed like n baby.
At last a day came when the nurse's oecupation was over. Early one
morning as Pitt Crawley was at his steward's and bailiff's books in the
study, a knock came to the door, and Hester presented herself dropping a
curtsey, and said,
 If you please, ir Pitt, Sir Pitt died this moruing, Sir Pitt. I was
a-making of his toast, Sir Pitt, for his gruel, Sir Pitt, wlich he took eery
morning reglar at six, Sir Pitt, aud-I thought I henrd a onn-like, Sir
Pitt-and-and-and--''. She dropped nnother curtsey.

money,'' he thought, and rapidly calculated its incumbrances and the
improvements which he would muke. lIe would not use his aunt's
money previously, lest Sir TPitt should recover, und his outlay be in vain.
All the blinds were pulled down at the Hall ind Rector : the church
bell was tolled, and thec clancel hung in black; nud Bute Crawley dil'nt
go to a coursing meeting, but went nd dinel quietly at Fuddlestone,
where they talked about his deceased brothcr and young Sir Pitt over
thcir port. Miss Betsy, who was by this time nrried to a suaddler at
Mudbury, cried a good deal. The family surgeon role over and paid
his respecetful compliments, and inquiries for the henltl of tlcir lady-
ships.  The death was talked about ant Mulbury and at the Crawley
Arms; the landlord wherceof had bccome reconciled with the Rector of
late, who was occasionally known to step into the parlour annd taste Mr,
Horrocks' mnild beer.
 Shnll I write to your brother-or will you '' asked Lady Jane of her
husband, Sir Pitt.
I will write, of course,'' Sir Pitt said, ``and invite him to tho funeral:
it will he but beeoming.''
`And-and- Mrs. Rawdon,'' asaid Lady Jane, timilly.

 Mrs. Rawdon must of course be asked,'' snid Sir Pitt, resolutely.
eNot whilst I am in the lousel'' snid Lndy Southlown.
ee Your Ladyship will be pleased to recollect that I nm the hend of this
family,'' Sir Pitt replied. `If you please, Lady Jane, you will write a
letter to Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, requesting her presence upon this
melancholy occasion.''
' Jane, I forbid you to put pen to paperl'' cried the Countess.
I believe I am the head of this fumily,'' Sir Pitt repeated; ``and
however much I may regret any circumstauce which may lead to your
Ladyship quitting this house, must, if you please, continue to govern it
as I see fit,''
Lady Southdown rose up as magnificent as Mrs. Siddons in Lady

sorrows somewhere in loneliness and pray for their conversion to better
tloughts.
We don't turn you out of our house, Mnmma,'' said the timid Lady
Jane imploringly.
You invite such company to it as no Christian lady should meet, and
I will have my horses to-morrow morning.''
IHnve the goodness to write, Jane, under my dictation,'' said Sir Pitt
rising anl throwing himself into an attitule of command likc the Por-
trait of a Gentleman in the Exhibition, '`nd begin. ueen's Crawley,
September 14, 182.-My der brother--'
Hearig these decisive and terrible words, Lndy MIacbeth, who had
een waiting for a sign of weakness or acillation on the part of her
ason-in-law, rose, and with a scnrel look, left the librry. Lady Jane
looked up to her husband ns if she sould fain follow ani soothe her
inamma; but Pitt forbade his wife to move.
`She won't go away,'' he said. She has lct her house at Brighton,
and has spent her last half-year's dividends. A Countess living at an in
is a ruined woman. I hae been waiting long for an opportunity to tnke
this-this decisive step, my love; for, as you must perceive, it is impos-
sible that there should be two ehiefs in a inmily: and now, if you please,
we will resume the dictation. My dear brother, the melancholy intelligenee
which it is my duty to convey to my family must hae long been anticipated
by,''' c.
In a word, Pitt hnving come to his kingdom, and having Uy good luck,
or desert rather, as he considered, assumed almost nll the furcune which
his other relatives had expected, ws determined to treat his family kindly
nnd respcctably, anl make a house of neen's Crnley once more. It
plesed him to think thnt he should be its chief. He proposed to use the
vast influence that his commanding talents and position must speedily
acquire for him in the county to get his brother placed and his cousins
decently proided for, and perhaps had na little sting of repentance as he
thought that he was the proprietor of all that tley had loped for. In the
course of three or four lays' reign his bearing was changed, and his plans
quite fixed : he determined to rule justly and honestly, to depose Lady
Southlown, and to be on the friendliest possible terms with all the rela-
tions of his blood.
So he dictated a letter to his brother Rawdon-a solemn and elaborate
letter, containing the profoundest observations, couched in the longest
words, and filling with wonder the simple little secretary, who wrote under
her husband's order. What an orator this will be,'' thought she, ``when
he enters the House of Commons'' (on which point, and on the tyranny of
Lady Southdown, Pitt hnd sometimes dropped hints to his wife in bed);
`` how wise and good, and what a genius my husband isl I fancied him
n little eold; but how good, and what a genius l''
The fact is, Pitt Crawley had got eery word of the letter by heart, and
had studiet it, with diplomatic seereey, deeply and perfectly, long before
he thought fit to communicate it to his astonished wife.
This letter, with a huge black border and seal, was aceordingly dispatched

Crawley was but half-pleassed at the receipt of it.  What's the use of
going don to that stupid place'' thought he. I can't stand being
alone with Pitt after dinnses. and horses there and back will cost us twenty
pound.''
He carried the letter, as he did all difficulties, to Becky, upstairs in
her bel-room-with her chocolate, which he always made and took to her
of a morning.
He put the tray with the breakfast and the letter on the dressing-table,
before which Becky sate eombing her yellow hair. She took up the black-
edged missive, and having read it, she jumped up from the chair, crying
 Huray 1'' and waving the note round her head.

e He's not left us anything, Becky. I had my share when I came
of age.''
e You 'll neer be of age, you silly old man,'' Becky replied. `Run out
now to Madam Brunoy's, for I must have some mourning: and get a
crape on your hat, and a black waistcoat--I lon't think you've got one;
order it to be brought home to-morrow, so that e may be able to astart
on Thursday,''
e You don't mean to go?'' Rawdon interposed.
e Of course I mean to go. I mean that Lady Jane shall present me at
Court next year. I mean that your brother shall give you a seat in Par-
liament, you stupid old creature. I mean that Lord Steyne shall have
your vote and his, my dear, old, silly man; and that you shall be an
Irish Secretary, or a West Indian Governor: or a Trcasurer, or a Consul,
or some such thing.''
Posting will cost a dooce of na lot of money,'' grumbled Rawdon.
 WYe might take Southdown's carriage, which ought to be present at
the funeral, as he is a relation of the family: but, no-I intend that we
shall go by the conch. They 'll like it better. It seems more humble--''
Rawdy goes of courseP'' the Colonel asked.
No such thing; why pay an extra place He's too big to travel
bodkin bctween you and me. Let him stay here in the nursery, and
Briggs can make him a black froek. Go you: and do as I bid you. hnd
you hal best tell Sparks, your man, that old Sir Pitt is dead, and thnt you
will come in for something considerable when the affairs are arranged.
Ie 'll tell this to Rnggles, who has been pressing for money, and it will
console poor Raggles.'' And eo Becky begn sipping her choeolate.
When the faithful Lord Steyne arrived in the evening, he found Becky
and her companion, who was no other than our friend Briggs, busy
culling, ripping., uipping, and tearing all sorts of black stuffs aailable
for the melancholy oecasion.
 Miss Briggs and I are plunged in grief and despondency for the death
of our apa,'' Rebecca said. : Si Pitt Crawley is dead, my lord. We
have been tearing our hair all the morning, and now we are tearing up
our old clothes,''
Oh, Rebecca, how can you--'' was all that Briggs could say as she
turned up her cyes.
 Oh, Rebcecca, how cn you-'' echoed my Lord. ``So that old
scoundrel 's deal, is heP IIe might have been a Peer if he had played his

 I might lae been Silenus's widow,'' said obecca. `Don't you
remcmber, Miss Briggs, how you peeped in at the door; and saw old Sir
Pitt on his knees to me'' ' Miss Briggs, our old friend, blushed very
much at this reiniscence ; nnd was glad when Lord Steyne ordered her
to go down stairs and make him n cup of tca.

ane, who was good to her and to everybody; but Lady Southdown
dismissed poor Briggs as quickly as decency permitted; and Mr.Pitt (who
thought himself much injured by the unealled-for generosity of his deceased
relative towards a lady who ld only been Miss Crawley's faithful retainer
a seore of years) made no objeetions to that exercise of the dowager's
authority. Bowls and Firkin likewise reeeived their legacies, and their
dismissals; and married and set up a lodging-house, aecording to the
custom of their kind.
Briggs tried to live with her relations in the country, but found that
attempt was vain after the better society to which she hnd been accus-
tomed. Those persons, small tradesmen in a country town, quarrelled
over Miss Briggs's tforty pounds n-yenr, as eagerly and more openly than
Miss Crawley's kinafolk had for tlat lady's inheritance. Briggs's brother,
a radical hatter and grocer, cnlled his sister a purse-proud aristocrat, be-
cause she would not advance as part of her capital to stock his shop: and
she would have donc it most likely, but that their sister, a dissenting
shoemaker's lady, at variance with the hatter and grocer who went to
another clapel, showed how their brother was on the verge of bnankruptcy,
nnd took possession of HBriggs for a while. The dissenting shoemaker
wnnted Miss Briggs to send his son to college, and make a gentlcman of
him. Between themn the two fumilies got a great portion of her privnte
saings out of her: and finally sho fled to Lonlon followel by thc
anathemas of both, nn determined to seek for servitude ngin as infinitely
less onerous than lberty. And ndvertising in the papers that a '` Gentle-
woman of agreeable manners, and accustomed to the best society was
anxious to,'' &c., she took up hcr residence with Mr. MBowls in Half Moon
Street, and waited the result of the advertisement.
So it was that she fell in with Iebecea. Mrs. Rawdon's dashing little
carriage and ponies was whirling down the street one day, just as Miss
Briggs, fatigued, had reached Mr. Bowls's door, after n weary walk to the
Times Othice in thie City, to insert her advertiscment for the sixth timc.
Rebecca was driviug, and at once recognised the gentlewoman with agree-
able manners, and being a perfectly gool-hmoured woman, as we hava
seen, nnd having a regard for lriggs, she pulled up the ponies at the
door-steps, gave the rcins to the groom, nnd jumping out had hold of
both Briggs's hands, before she of the agreenble manners had recovered
from the shock of seeing an old friend.
Briggs cried, anl Becky laughed a grcat dcnl, and kisscl the gentle-
woman as soon as they got into the passage; and thence into Mrs, Bowls's
front parlour, with the red moreen curtains, and the round looking-glass,
with the ehminel cagle ubove, gazing upon the buck of the ticket in thc
winlow which announced ' Apartments to Lct.''
Briggs told all her history milst those perfcctly uncnllcl-for sobs and
jaculations of wonder with whieh women of her soft nature salute nn old
acquaintance, or regard a rencontre in thc street ; for though peoplc meet
other people every day, yct somc thiere nre who insist upon discovering
miracles; and womcn, cven though they have disliked ench other, begin to

quarrellel. So, in a word, Briggs told all her history, and Becky gasea
narrative of her own life, with her usual artlessness and cundour.
Mrs. Bowls, late Firkin, came and listened grily in the passage to the
hysterical sniffling and giggling wlich went on in the front parlour. Beky
had never been a faourite of her's. Since the establishment of the married
couple in London they had frequented their former friends of the house of
Raggles, and did not like the latter's account of the Colonel's neiage.
`I would'nt trust him, Hlagg, my boy,'' Bols remarked: and his wie, when
Mrs. Rawdon issued from the parlour, only saluted tle lady with a ery
sour curtsey; nnd her fingers were like so many sauasages, cold and lifeless,
when she held them out in deference to Mrs. Rawdon, who persisted in
shaking hands with the retired lady's maid. She whirled away inlo
Piccadilly, nodding, with the sweetest of smiles towards Miss Briggs, la
hung nolding at the window close under the adertisement-card, and at
the next moment was in the Park with a half dozen of dnnlies canteriag
nfter her carriage.
When se found how her friendl was situatel, and how hasing n
suug legacy from Miss Crwley, salary wss no object to our gentlesomn,
Becky instantly formed some benevolent little domestic plans couceruing
her. This was just such a companion as would suit her establishment.
and she invitel Briggs to come to dinner with her that very cvening, hen
she would show her dear little larling Rawlon.
Mrs. Bowls cautioned her lolger against venturing into the lion's dn,
t wherein you will rue it, Miss l3., mark my words, and as sure as m5
nnme is Bodwls.'' And riggs promised to be very cautious. The upshot
of which caution was that she went to live with MIrs. Rawlon the est
week, and had lent Rawdon Cranley six hundred pounds upon aunut
efore six more months were over.

Sir Pitt Crnwley warned of thein
arrival, Colonel Crawley nnd his
wife took a couple of places in
the same old Highflyer coach, by
which HRehecca had travelled in
the defunet Baronet's company,
and on her first jouruey into tho
world some nine years before.
How well she rememberced thc
Inn Yard, and the ostler to
whom she refused money, and
the insinuating Cnmbridge lad
who wrapped her in his coat on
thc journey. Rawdon took his
placee outside, and would havc
liked to drive, but his grief for-
bade him. He snte by the coach-
man, and talked about horses and
the road the whole way; and
who kept the inns, and who horsed the conch by which he had travelled
so many a time, when he and Pitt were boys going to Eton. At Mulbury
era carriage and a pair of horses reeeived them, with a cochman in black.
It's the old drag, Rawdon,'' Rebecea said, as they got in.  The worms
hae eaten the cloth a good leal-there's the stain whiech Sir Pitt-hal I
see Dawson the Ironmonger has his shutters up-which Sir Pitt made such

saluted, and recognised people here and there graciously. Their recog-
nitions were inexpressibly pleasant to her. It seemed as if she was not
an impostor any more, and was coming to the home of her ancestors.
Rawdon was rather abashed, and cast down on the other hand. What

e Your sisters must be young women now,'' Recbeeca said, thinking of
those girls for the first time perhaps since she had left them.
 Don't know, I'm shw,'' replied the olonel.  Hullo1 here's old
Mother Loek. 1Iow-dy-do, Mrs. Lock. Remember me, don't you
Master Hadon, heyP Dammy how those old women last; she was a
hundred when I was a boy.''
They were going through thelodge-gates kept by old Mrs. Lock, whose
hand llebccca insisted upon slaking, as she flung open the creaking old
iron gate, and the carriage pussed between the two moss-grown pillars
surmounted by the dove and serpent.
 The governor has cut into the timber,'' awdon said, looking abont,
and then was silent-so was lBecky. Both of them were rather agitated,
nnd thinking of old times. IIe about Eton, and his mother, whomn he
remembered, n frigid demure woman, and a sister who died, of whom he
had been passionutcly fond; and how he used to thrash Pitt; and ahout
litle Rawdy at home. And Rebecea thought about her own youth, and
the dark seecrets of those early tainted days; and of her entrance into life
by yonder gates; nnd of Miss Pinkcrton, and Joe, and Amelia.
The gravel walk and terrace lad been scraped quite clean. A grand
paiuted hatchment was alrcady over the great entranee, and two very
solemn and tall personiages in black flung open each a lenf of the door as
the carriage pulled up at the familiar steps. Rawdon turned red, aud
Becky somewhnt pale, as they puassed through the old hall, arm in arm.
She pinchel her husband's arn as they entered the oak parlour, where Sir
ltt and his wife were ready to receive them. Sir Pitt in black, Lady
Jane in black, nnd my ILaly Southdown with n large blaek head-piece of
bugles and fetlers, whieh wavel on her Lndyship's head like an under-
taker's tray.
Sir Pitt had judged correctly, that she would not quit the premises.
She contented lerself by prcserving a solemn and stony silence, when in
company of Pitt nnd his rehellious wife, and hy frightening the children in
the nursery by the ghastly gloom of her demeanour. Only a very iaint
bending of the hea-dress anl plumes welcomed Rawdon and his wife, as
tlose prodigals returuel to their family.
o say the truth, they were not alfeeted vcry much one way or other by
this coolness. Her Ladyslip, strange to say, wns a person only of secondary
consideration in tleir miuds just then-thiey were intent upon the reception
which the reigning brother and sister would nfford them.
Pitt with rather a hleightened colour went up and shook his brother by
the hand; and saluted llebeccn with a hand-shake and a very low bow.
But Ludy Jane took both the hands of her sister-in-law and kissed her
affectionately. The embrace somchow brougt tcars into the eyes of the

he artlese mark of kindness and confidence touched and pleased her; and
Ruwdon, cncouraged by this demonstration on his sister's part, twirled up
lis mustachios, and took lenve to salute Lady Jane with a kiss, which
cuusel her Ladyship to blush exceedingly.

his wife were together again. 'Pitt's got fat too, and is doing the thing

hnndsomely.  He can afford it,'' said Rcbecca, and agreed in ler
husband's farther opinion, `" that the mother-in-law was a tremedous old
Guy-and that the sisters were rather well-looking young women,''
They, too, had been summoned from school to attcnd the funeral
cereonics. It seemed Sir itt Crawley, for the dignity of the house
nnd family, id tlought right to have about the place as many persons in
black as could possibly be assembled. All the men and maids of the
house, the old women of the Alms House, whom the elder Sir Pitt had
cheated out of a great portion of their due, the arish clerk's family, nud
the specil retainers of both 1Iall and ectory were habited in suble;
added to these, the undcrtaker's men, at least a score, with crnpes and hat-
bnds, and who made a goodly show when the great burying show took
place-but tese are mute personages in our drama, and having nothing to
do or say need occupy a very little space here.
With regard to ler sisters-in-laws ebecca did not attempt to forget her
formcr position of Goveruess towards them, but recalled it frankly and
kindly, and asked them about thcir studies withi great gravity, and told
them that she had thought of tlem many nnd many a duy, nnd longed to
kuow of their elluare. In fact you would have supposed that ever since
she nd left them she had not censed to keep thcm uppermost iu her
thoughts, aud to take the tenderest interest in their welfare. So supposed
Lady Crawley herself and her young sisters.
She's hardly changed since eight years,'' sid Miss losalind to Miss
Violet, as they were preparing for linner.
Those red-haired women look wonderfully well,'' repliet the other.
 Her's is much dnrker than it was; I think she must dye it,'' Miss
Rosalind added. ` She is stouter, too, and altogetler improved,'' con-
tinued Miss osalind, who was disposed to be very fat.
At least she gives herself no airs, and remebers that she was
our Goveruess once,'' Miss Violet said, intimating that it betitted all
governesses to keep tleir proper place, and forgetting altogether that she
was granddaughter not only of Sir Wulpole Crawley, but of Mr. Dawson
of Mudbury, and so had a coal-scuttle in her scutcheon. There are other
very well-meaning people whom one meets evcery day in Vanity lair, wlo
are surely equally oblivious.
 It cun't be true what the girls at the Rectory said, that her mother
was an oera-daneer-''
'A person can't hclp their birtl,'' Rosalind replied with great libe-
rality. `And I agree with our brother, that as she is. n the family, of
course we are bound to notice her. I am sure Aunt Bute need not talk:
she wants to marry kate to young llooper, the wine-merchant, and
absolutely asked him to come to the Rectory for orders.''
`I wonder whether Lady Southdown will go away, she looked very
glum upon Mrs. Rawdon,'' the other said.
 I wish she would. I won't read the  Washerwoman of Finchley
Common,''' vowed Violet; and so saying, and avoiding a passage at the
end of which a certain coffin was placel with a couple of wntclers, and
lglts perpetually burning in the closed room, these young womeu cuame
down to the family dinner, for which the bell rang as usual.

But before this, Lady Jane conducted Rebecca to the aspartments pre-
pred for her, which with the rest of the house had assumed a very much
improvcd appearance of order and comfort during Pitt's regeney, and
here beholding that MIrs. Rawdon's modest little trunks had arrived, and
were placed in the bed-room and dressing-roon adjoining, helped her to
take off her neat black bonnet and cloak, and asked her sister-in-law in
wlat more she eould be useful.
 What I should like best,'' said Rebeccs, ``woull be to go to the
nursery ; and asee your dear little chillren'' On which the two laies looked
very kindly at each other, and went to that apartment hand in hand.
lecky admired little Mutildna, who was not quite four years ol, as the
most charming little lore in the world; and the boy, a little fellow of two
years-pale, heavy-eyed, and large-headed, she pronouuced to be a perfect
prodigy in point of size, intelligence, and bcuty.
eI wish Mamma wonll not insist on giving him so much melicine,''
Lady Jane said, with a sigh. `I often think we shonld all be better
without it,'' And then Lady Jane and her new-found friend had one of
those confidential medical conversations about the children, which all
mothers, and most women, as I am given to understand, delight in. Fifly
yenrs ngo, and when the present writer, being an interesting little boy,
wns ordered out of the room with the ladies after dinncr, I remember
quite well that their talk was chiefly about their ailmcnts; and putting tlis
question directly to two or three since, I have always got from them the
acknowledgmeut that times are not changed. ILet ny fair readers remark
for themselves this very evening when they quit the dessert-table, and
assemble to celebrate the drawing-room mysteries. Well-in half-an-hour
Becky and ILady Jane were close and intimnte friends-and in the coursc
of the cvening her Ladyship informed Sir Pitt that she thought her ne
sister-in-law was a kiud, frank, unaffected, and affectionate young
oman.
And so having easily won the daughter's good-will, the indefatigable
little wouan bent herself to conciliate the august Lndy Southdown. As
soon as she found her Ladyship alone, Rebecca attacked her on the nursery
question at onee, and snid that her own little boy was saved, actually
saved, by calomel, freely adminiatered, when all the physicians in Paris
had given the denr child up. And thcn she mentioned how often she had
heard of Lady Soutldown from that cxcellent man the Reverend Lwrence
Grills, Minister of the clapel in My Fair, which she frequented; and
how her views were very much changed by circumstances and misfortunes;
nnd how she hoped that n past life spent in worldliness and error might
not incespacitate her from nore serious thought for the future. She described
how in former days sle hnd been inlebted to Mr. Crawley for religions
instruction, touched upon the  Washerwoman of Finchley Common,'' which
she had rcal with the greatest profit, and nsked nbont Lndy Emily, its
giftcd author, now Lady Emily Hornblower, at Cape Town, where her
husband had strong hopes of becoming Bishop of Cnfraria.
But she crowned nll, and confirmed herself in Iady Southdown's favonr,
by feeling very much agitated and unwell after the funeral, and requesting
her Lalyship's melicl advice, wlich the Dowsger not only gave, hut,

wrapped up in a bed-gown, and looking more like Lady Mncbeth than

Becky first accepted the tracts, and began to examine them with great
interest, engaging the Dowager in a conversation concerning them and tne
welare of her soul, by which means she hoped that her body might escape
medication. But after the religious topiecs were exhausted, Lady Macbeth
would not quit Becky's chamber until her cup of night-drink was emptied
too; and poor Mrs. Rawdon was compelled actually to assume a look of
gratitude, and to swallow the melicine under the unyielding old Dowager's
nese, who left her victim finlly with a benediction.
It did not much comfort Mrs. kRawdon; her countenance was very queer
when Rawdon came in and heard what hd happened; and his explosions
of laughter were as loud as usual, when Becky, with a fun which she could
not disguise, even tlough it was at her own expense, deseribed the
oeeurrence, and how she had been victimised by Lady Southdown. Lord

acted the whole scene for them. She put on a night-cap and gown. She
preached a great sermon in the true serious manner: she lectured on the
virtue of the medicine which she pretended to administer, with a grasity
of imitation so perfect, that you would have thought it was the Countess's
ow Roman nose throngh which she snuffled. :`Give us Lady Southdown
and the black dose,'' wss a constant cry amongst the folks in Becky's little
drawing-room in Mny Fair. And for the first time in her life the Dowager
Countess of Southdown was made amusing.
Sir Pitt remembered the testimonies of respect and veneration which
Rebceca had paid personally to himself in early dys, and was tolerably
well disposed towarls her. The marriage, ill-advised as it was, had
improved Rnwdon very much--that was clear from the Colonel's altered
habits and demeanour-and had it not been a lucky union as regarded
Pitt himself2 The cunning diplomatist smiled inwarly as he owned that
he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not tc
cry out ogainst it. His satisfaction was not rcnoved by Rehecca's own
statements, behaviour, and conversation.
She doubled the deference which before had charmed him, calling out
his conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise Pitt himself,
who, always inclinel to respect his own talents, admired them the more when
Rebecca pointed them out to him. With her sister-in-law, Rebeeca was satis-
factorily able to prove, that it was Mrs. Bute Crawley wlo brought about
the marriage which she nfterwards so calumniated : that it wns Mrs. Bute's
avarice-who loped to gin all  Miss Crawley's fortune, and deprive
Rawdon of his aunt's faour-which caused and invented nll the wickel
reports against Rebeccn. `t She succeeded in making us poor,'' Rebeccas
snid, with an air of angelical patience; ``but how csn I be angry with a
woman who has given me one of the best husbands in the worldP And has
not her own avarice been sufticiently punished by the ruin of her own
hopes, and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?
PoorI'' she eried. `Dear Lady Jane, what care we for povertyP I am
used to it from childhood, and I am often thankful thal Miss Crawley's
money has gone to restore the splendour of the noble old family of which
I am so proud to be a member. I am sure Sir Pitt will make a mucl
letter use of it than Rawdon would.''
All these speeches were reported to Sir Pitt by the most fuaithful of
wives, and increased the fuavourable impression which Rebecca made; so
mnch so, that when on the third dy after tle funeral the family party
were at dinner, Sir Pitt Crawley, carving fowls at the head of the table,
actually said to Mre. Rawdon, ``AhemI Releeeca, may lI gie you as wing''
-a speech which made the little woman's eyes sparkle with plensure
While Rebecca was prosecuting the above schemes and hopes, and Pitt
Craley arranging the funerl ceremonial and other ratters conneected
with his future progress and dignity, and Lndy Jane busy with her nursery,
as far as her mother would let her, and the sun rising and setting, and tha
lock-tower bell of the lIall ringing to dinner and to prayers as usul, tha
body of the late owner of ueen's Crawley lay in the apartment whlich he
had oezupied, watched unceasingly by the professional attendants who

were engaged for that rite. A woman or two, and three or four under-
taker's men, the best whom Southampton could furnish, ressed in black,
nnd of a proper stealthy and tragical demeanour, had charge of the remains
which they watched turn about, haring the housekeeper's room for their
place of rendezvous when off duty, where they played at curds in privacy
and drank their beer.
The members of the family and eerants of the house kent away from
the gloomy spot, where the bones of the descendant of an ancient line of
knights and gentlemen, lay awaiting their final consignment to the family
crypt. No regrets attended them, sae those of the poor woman who had
hoped to be Sir Pitt's wife and wilow, and who had fled in disgrace from
the Hall over which she had so neurly been a ruler. Ileyond her and a
favorite old pointer he had, and between whom and himself an attachment
subsisted during the period of his imbecility, tle old man had not a single
friend to mourn lim, having indeed, during the whole course of his litfe,
never taken the least pains to secure one. Could the best and kindest of
us who depart from the earth, have an opportunity of revisiting it, I
suppose he or she (assuming that any Vanity Fair feelings subsist in the
sphere whither we are bound) would have a pang of mortitication at finding
how soon or survivors were consolced. And so Sir lPitt was forgotten-
like thc kindest nnd best of us-only a few weeks sooner.
Those who will may follow his reains to the grave, whither they were
borne on the appointed day, in the most becoming manner, the family in
black coaches, with their hnndkerchiefs up to their noses, rendy for the
tcars which did not come: the undertaker anl his gentlemen in deep
tribulation : the select tenantry mourning out of compliment to the new
landlord: the neighbouring gentry's carriages nt three miles an hour,
empty, and in profound uflliction: the parsou speaking out the formula
nbont `` our lear brother departed,'' As long as we have a man's body,
we play our Vunities upon it, surronnding it with hubug and ceremo-
nies, laying it in state, and paeking it up in gilt nails and velvet ; and we
finish our duty by placing over it a stone, written all over with lies,
Bute's crate, a smart young fellow from Oxford, and Sir IPitt Crawley,
composed between themn nn appropriate Lntin epitaph for the late lamented
Baronet: and the former preached a classical seron, exhorting the sur-
vivors not to gie way to grief, and informing them in the most respcctful
terms that they aleo would be one dny ealled upon to pass that gloomy
nnd mysterious portal which hl just closed upon the remains of their
lamented brother. Then tle teuantry mounted on horseback again, or
stayed and refreshed tlemseles at the Crawley Arms. Then, ufter a
lunch in the serant's hall at ucen's Crawley, the gentry's crriages
wheelel off to their different destinations: then the undertaker's men,
taking the ropes, palls, velvets, ostrich feathers, and other mortuary pro-
perties, clambered up on the roof of the hearse, and rode off to South-
ampton. Their faces relapsed into a natural expression as the horses,
clearing the lodge-gates, got into a brisker trot on the open road; and
squads of them might have been seen, speckling with black the publio-
house entrances, with pewter-pots ilashing in the sunshine. Sir Pitt's

pointer used to hol sometimes at first, but these were the only aceents of
grief which were heard in the Hall of which Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet, hsd
beenu master for some tlree-score years.
As the birds were pretty plentilful, and partridge-shooting is as it were
the duty of an English gentleman of statesman-like propensities, Sir Pitt
Crawley, the first shock of grief over, went out a little and partook of that
diversion in a white hat with a crape round it. The sight of those fields
of stubble and turmnips, now his own, gave him many secret joys. Some-
times, and with an exquisite humility, he took no gun, but went out with
a peaceful bamboo cane; Rawdon, his big brother, and the keepers blazing
away at his side. Pitt's money and acres had a great efect upon his
brother. The penniless Colonel beeame cuite obsequious and respectful
to the head of his louse, and despised the milk-sop Pitt no longer.
Rawdon listened with sympathy to his senior's prospects of planting and
draining: gave his advice about the stables and cattle, rode over to Mud-
bury to look at n mare which he thought would carry Lady Jane, and
offered to break her: &c: the rcbellious dragoon was quite humbled and
subdued, and became n most creditable younger brother. He had constant
bulletins from Miss Briggs iu London respecting little Ruwdon, who was
lcft belind there: who sent messages of his own. ``I am very well,'' he
wrote. I hope you are very well. I hope MNamma is very well. The
pouy is very well. Grey takes me to ride in the Park. I can canter.
I net the little boy who role before. He eried when he eauterel. I da
not cry.'' Rawdon real these letters to his brother, and Lady Jane, who
was delighted with them. The Baronet promised to take charge of the
lad at school; and his kind-hearted wife gave Rebecca a bank-note, beg-
ging her to buy a present with it for her little nephew.
One day followed another, and the ladies of the louse passed their life
in those calm pursuits and amusements which satisfy country ladies.
Bells rang to meals, and to prayers. The young ladies took exercise on
the piano-forte every morning after breakfast, Rebecca giving them the
enefit of her instruction. Then they put on thick shoes nnd walked in
the park and shrubberies, or beyond the palings into the village, descending
upon the cottages, with Lady Southdown's medicine and tracts for the
sick people there. Lady Southdown droe out in a pony-chaise, when
kebeccs would take her place by the Dowager's side, and listen to her
solemn talk with the utmost interest. She sang Handel and Haydn ta
the family of evenings, and engaged in a large piece of worsted work, as
if she lad been born to the business, and as if this kind of life was to
continue with her until she should sink to the grave in a polite old age,
leaving regrets and a great quantity of consols behind her-as if there were
not cares and dus, schemes, shifts, and poverty, waiting outside the Park
gates, to pouncee upon her when she issued into the world again.
It isn't litfficult to be a country gentleman's wife,'' Rebecca thought.
I think I could be a good woman if I hsd fie thousand a year. I could
dnwdle about in the nursery, and count the apricots on the wall. I could
water plants in a green-house, and pick off dead leaves from the geraniums.

worth of soup for the poor. I shouldu't miss it much, out of five thou-
sand s year. I could even drivo out ten miles to dine at a neiglbovr's,
and dress in the fashions of the year belfore last. I could go to chureh
and keep awuke in the gret fuamily pew: or go to slcep bchind the
curtains, and with my veil down, if I only had practice. I coull pay
everybody, if I had but the money. This is what the conjurors hcre
pride themselves upon doing. Tey look down with pity upon us miserable
sinners who hae none. hey tlink themselves generous if they give our
children n five-pound note, and us contcmptible if we are without one.''
And who knows but Rebeeca was right in hcr speculations-and that it
was only a question of money and fortune which made the diflerence
between hcr and an honest woman If you take tcemptations iuto nccouut,
who is to say that he is better than his ueighbour? A comfortable career
of prosperity, if it does uot make people honest, at lcast keeps them so.
An alderman coming from a turtle feast will not stcp out of his carriage to
steal a leg of mutton ; but put him to atarve, and see if he will not prloi:
n loaf. lBecky consoled erself by so balancig the chunces uud equalising
the distribution of good anl evil in the world.
Tle old haunts, the old fiells and wools, the copses, pouds and gardes,
the rooms of the old house where shie had speut a couple of years seven
years ago, were all carefully revisited by ler. Shc hnd been young there
or comparativcly so, for she forgot the time when she cver vas young-
but she remembered her thoughts uand feelings seven years back, and con-
trasted them with those whichi she had at present, now thut she had seen
the world nnd livel with great people, and raised herself far beyond her
original humble station.
I have passed beyond it because I have brains,'' Becky thought,
`and almost all the rest of the world are fools. I could not go buck, and
consort with those pcople now, whom I used to meet in my fatler's studio.
Lords come up to my door with stars und gurters instead of poor artists
with screws of tobacco in their pockets. I have a gentleman for my
husband, and an lEarl's daughter for my sister in the very house wlere I
was little better thn a servant a few ycars go. But am I much better
to donow in the world than I was when I was the poor painter's daughter,
nd whcedled the grocer round the corner for sugur and tea? Suppose I
had married Francis wlo ws so fond of me-I couldn't have bcen mucl
poorer than I am now. lIeigho I wish I could exclange ny position
in society, nnd all my relations for a snug sum in the lhree per Cent.
Consols;'' for so it was that Becky felt the Vnnity of human atlfairs, and
it was in those- securities tlat she would have liked to cast anchor.
It may, perhaps, have struck her that to have been honest and humble,
to have done er duty, and to have marched straightforward on her way,
would have brought hcr as near happiness as that path by wvhich she ws
astriving to attain it. But,-just as the children at Gueen's Crawley went
round the room, where the body of their father lay ;-if ever Becky had
these thoughts, she wns aecustomed to walk round them, and not look in.
She eluded them, and despised them-or at least she was committed to
the other path from which retreat was now impossible. And for my part
I believe that remorse is the lenst active of all a man's moral scnses-thc

Yery easiest to be deadened when wakened: and in some never wakened
at all. We grieve at being found out, and at the idea of shnme or puniah-
ment; but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people unhappy in
Vnity Fair.
So Rebecca, during her stay at ueen's Crawley, made as many friends
of the Mammon of Unrighteousuess as she could possibly bring under
control. Lady Jane and her husband bade her farewell with the warmest
deonstrations of good will. They lookced forward with pleasure to the
time when the family-house in Gaunt Street being repaired and beautified;
they were to meet again in London. Lady Southdown made her up a
paeket of medicine, aud sent a letter by her to the Rev, Lswrence Grills,
exlorting that gentleman to save the brand who ``honoured'' the letter
from the burning. Pitt aceompanied them with four horses in te carriage
toMudbury, having sent on their baggage in a cart previously, aceompanied
with londs of game.
 How happy you will be to see your darling little boy again,'' Lndy
Crawley said, taking leave of her kinswoman.
O so happy l'' said Rebecca, throwing up the green eyes. She was
immensely happy to be freo of the place, ad yet loth to go. ueen's
Crawley was abominably stupid; and yet the air there was somehow
purer than that which she had been accustomed to breathe. Everybody
had been dull, but hnl becn kind in their way. ``It is all the influence of a
long course of hree per Cents,'' Beecky said to herself, and wass right very
likely.
Iiowvever, the London lamps flashcd joyfully as the stage rollel into
Piccadilly, and Briggs had male a benutiful fire in Curzon Street, and
little Rawdon was up to welcome back his papa and mamma.

WL'
ONSIDFERAII.E time has elapsed siuce we have seen
our respectable friend, old Mr, Osbomne of Russell
Square. He has not been the happicst of mortals
sincc last we met him. Events have occurred which
have not improved his teper, and in more instances
thnn one hc has not been allowed to have his own
way. To e thwarted in this reasonable desire was
always very injurious to the old gentleman; and
resistance became doubly exasperating whcn gout,
age, loneliness, and the force of mny disappoiut-
ments combined to weigh him down. His stiff black hair begon to grow
quite wlite soon after his son's dcath; his face grew redder; his hands trem-
bled more and more as he poured out his glass of port wine. lIe led his
clerks a dire life in the city: his family at home were not mucl happier.
I doubt if Rebccca, whom we have seen piously prnying for Consols,
wonld have exchanged her poverty and the dure-devil excitement and
chances of her life, for Oshorue's moncy and the humdrn gloom which
envelopel him. He had proposed for Miss Swartz, but had bcen rejected
scornfully by the partizans of that lady, who murriel hcr to a young sprig
of Scotch nobility. He was a man to hne married a woman out of low
life, and bulied her dreadfully afterwards: but no person prescnted herself
suitable to his taste; and instcad, hc tyranuised over his untnarricl daughte
at home. She had a fine carriage and fine horses, and sate at the heal of
a table loaded with the grandest plate. She had a cheque-book, n prize
footman to follow her when she walked, unlimited credit, nnd bows and
compliments from all the tradcsmen, and all the appurtenacees of an
heiress; bnt she spent n woful time. Tho little charity-girls at the Found-
ling, the sweeperess at the crossing, the poorest undcr-kitchen-maid in the
servant's hall, was happy compared to that unfortuate nnd now middle-

Frederie Bullock, Esq., of the house of Bullock, Huker, and Bullock, hal
married aria Osborne, not without a great denl of difficulty and grumbling
on Mr. Bullock's part. George being dead and cut out of his father's
will, Frederic insisted that thoe half of the old gentleman's property should
be settled upon his Mnria, and indeed, for a long time, refusel ' to come to
the scratch'' (it ws Mr. Frelerick's own expression) on any other terms.
Osborne said Fred had ngreed to tnke his daughtcr with twenty thousand,
anl he should bind himself tono more.  TFred might take it, and welcome,
or leave it, and go and be hanged.'' Fred, whose lopes lnd been raised

when George had been disinherited, thought himself infamously swindled
by the old merchant, and for some time made as if he would break off the
match altogether. Osbomne withdrew his aceount from Bullock and
Hulker's, went on Change with a horsewhip which he swore he would ls
ncross the back of a certain scoundrel that should be nameless, and
demeaned himself in his usual violent manner. Jane Osborne condoled
with her sister Maria during this family feud. ``I always told you,
Mnria, that it was your money he loved, aul not you,'' she said soothingly.
He selected ze and my money at any rate: he didn't choose you and
;::, -
partners counselled him to take MIaria, even with the twenty thousand
settled, hlf down, and half at the death of Mr. Osborne, with the chanees
of the further division of the property. So he ``knuckled down,'' agin
to use his own phrase; and sent old Hulker with peaceable overturesto
Osborne. I was his father, he snid, who would not hear of the match,
and had made the difficultics; he was most anxious to keep the cngage-
ment. The excuse was sulkily accepted by Mr. Osborne. Hulker and
Bullock were a high family of the city aristoeracy, and connected with thae
nobs'' at the West End. It was something for the old man to be able to
say `MIy son, Sir, of the house of IIulker, Bullock, and Co., Sir; my duaugh-
ter's cousin, Ludy MIry MInngo, Sir, daughter of the Right Hlon. the kEarl
of Castlemeuldy.'' In lis iagiation he saw his house peopled by the
``nobs.'' So hc forgave young Bullock, and consented that the marriage
should tako place.
It was a grand affair-the bridegroom's relaties giving the breakfast,
their habitations being near St. George's Hanover Square, where tle
business took place. The ``nobs of the West End,'' were invited, and
many of them signel thc book. Mr. Mango and Lady Miary Mango were
there, with the dear young Gwendoline and Gwinever MIango as brides-
maids; Colonel Bludyer of the Dragoon Guards (cldest son of the house
of Bludyer Brothers, Mincing Lue), another cousin of the bridegroom,
nnd the Honourable Mrs. Bludyer; the Honourable George Boulter, Lord
Levant's son, and his lady, Miss Mango that was; Lord Viscount Castle-
todly; Honourable James McMull and Mrs. MeMIull (formerly Miss
Swartz), and a host of faslionables, who hne all married into Lonbard
Street, and done a great deal to ennoble Cornhill.
The young couple had a house near Berkeley Square, an a small villa at
Roehampton, among the banking colony there. Fred was considered to
lave made rather a mnesalliauece by the ladies of his family, wlose granl-
father lad been in a Chrity School, and who wnere allied through th
husbands with some of the best blood in England. And Maria was
bound, by superior pride and grent care in the composition of her isiting-
book, to make up for the defeets of birth; and felt it her duty to see he
father and sister as little as possible.
That she should utterly break with the old man, who had still so many
ascores of thousnnd pounds to gie away, is absurd to suppose. Frel
Bullock would never allo her to do that. But she was still young and
ineapable of hiding her feelings: and by inviting her papa and sister to

her third-rate parties, and behaving vcry coldly to them when they came,
nnd by avoiding Russell Square, and indiscreetly begging her father to quit
that olious ulgar place; she did more harm than all Frederick's diplo-
macy could repair, and perilled her chance of her inheritance like a giddy
heedless creature as she was.
So Russell Square is not good enough for Mrs. Marias, hay?'' snid
the old gentleman, rattling up the carriage-windows, as he and his daughter
drove away one night from MIrs. Frederick Bullock's, after dinner. `` So
she invites her fnther and sister to a second duy's dinner (if those sides, or
ontrye, as she calls 'cm, weren't served yesterdny, I'm d-l), and to meet
City folks and littery men, and keeps the Eurls, and the Ladies, and the
Honourables to herself. Honoursblcs? Damu Honourables. I am a
plain British merchant I am: and could buy the begguarly hounds over

service of silver, and cn lny a better dinner on my mahogany, than ever
they see on theirs-the cringing, sneaking, stuck-up fools. Drive on
quick, James; I want to get bnek to Russell Square-ha, hal'' and he
sank back into the corner with a furious laugh. With such reflecetions on
his own superior merits, it was the custom of the old gentleman not
unfreuently to console himself.
Iane Osborne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her
sister's conduct; and when Mrs. Frederiek's first-born, Fredcric Augustus
Howard Stanley Devereux Bullock, wus born, old Osbomne, who was
invited to the christening mnd to be godfather, contented himself rith
sending the child a gold cup, wvith twenty guineas inside it for the nurse.
That's more thn any of your Lords will give, I 'll arrant,'' he said,
nnd refused to attend at the ceremony.
The splendour of the gift, lowever, caused great satisfaetion to the
houso of Bullock. Maria thonght that her fathuer was very much pleased
with her, and Frederic augured the best for his little son and heir.
One can fancy the pangs with whieh Miss Osborne in her solitude in
Russell Square read the ' Morning Post,'' where her sister's name occurred
every now and then, in the articles hended '' Fushionable Reunions,'' and
where shc had an opportunity of reading a description of Mrs, F. Bulloek's
costume, when presented at the drawing-room by Lndy Frederica Bulloek.
Jnne's own life, as we have snid, ndmitted of no such grandeur. It was an
awful existence. She had to get up of black winter's mornings to make
breakfast for her scowling old father, who would have turned the whole
house out of doors if his ten had not been realy at halti-past eight. She
remnined silent opposite to him, listening to the urn hissing, and sitting in
tremor while the parent read his paper, and consumed his accustomed
portion of muffins and tea. At lnlf-past nine he rose and went to the
City, and she was almost free till dinner-time, to make visitations in the
kitchen und to scold the servants: to drive nbrond and descend npon the
tradesmen, who were prodigiously respectful : to leave her cards and her
papa's at the great glum respectable houses of their City friends; or to sit

alone in the large drawing-ro, cpecting visitors; nnd working at a
huge pieee of worsted by the fire, on the sofa, hard by the great lIpligenia
eloeck, which tieked and tolled with mournful loudness in the dreary room.
The great glass over the mantel-piece, fuced by the other great eonsole
glass at the opposite end of te room, increased and multiplied between
them the brown lolland bag in which the chandelier hung; until you saw
these brown Holland bags fading away in endless perspectives, and this apart-
ment of Miass Osborne's seemed the centre of a system of drawing-rooms.
When she removed the cordoan leather from the grand piano, anul ven-
tured to plsy a few notes o it, it sounded with a mournful sadness,
startling the dismal cchoes of the house. George's picture was gone, and
luid up-stairs in a lumber-roo in thc garret; and though there was a
conusciousness of him, and father and daughter often instinctively knew
that they were thinking of him, no mention was ever made of the brare
aud once durling son.
At five o'clock Mr. Osborne camc back to lis dinner, which he and his
daughter took in silence (seldom broken, except when he swore and was
savage, if the cooking was not to his liking), or which they shared twice in
n month with a party of dismal friends of Osborne's rank and age. Old
r. Gulp and his lady from Bloosbury quarc: old Mr. Frowser, the
attorney, from lBedford Rlow, a very great man, and from his business,
hand-in-glove with the ``nobs at the WYest End :'' old Colonel Livermore, of
tle Bombay Ary, and Mrs. Livermore, from Upper Bedford Place  old
Berjeant otfy and Mrs. Toffy ; and sometimes old Sir Thoms Coffin and
Lady Coffin, from Bedforl Square. Sir `Thomas was celebrated as a
hanging judge, and the purticular tawny port was produced when he dined
with Mr. Osborne.
These people and their like gae the pompous Russell Square merchant
pompous dinners back again. They had solemn rubbers of whist, when
they went up-stairs after drinking, and their carriages were called at half-
past ten. Mlany rich people, whom we poor devils are in the habit of
cnvying, lend contentedly an existence like that above described. Jane
Osborne scurcely ever met n man under sixty, and almost the ounly bachelor
who appeared in their society wns Mr. Smirk, the celebrated Lndy'sdoctor.
I can't say that nothing hal occurred to disturb the monotony of this
nwful existence : the fuct is, there had bcen a secret in poor lane's life
which had made her fnther more suvage and morose than even uature,
pride, and over-feeding had made him. This secret wns connected with
Miss Wirt, who had n cousinu an nrtist, MIr. Smee, very celebratedl siuce as
a portrait-painter and Il,A., but who once was glad enough to give
drawing-lessons to ladies of faslion. Mr. Smce has forgotten where Rus-
sell Square is now, but he was glad enough to visit it in the year 1818,
when Miss Osborne had instruetion from him.
Smee (formerly n pupil of sharpe of Frith Street, a dissolute, irregular,
and unsuecessful mn, but a man with gret knowledge of his art) being
the cousin of Miss WVirt, we suay, and introduced by her to Miss Osborne,
whose hand and heart were still free after various ineomplete love affairs,
felt a great attachment for this lady, and it is believed inspired one in her
hosom. Miss Wirt was tle contidante of this intrigue. I know not

whether she uscd to leave the room where the master and his pupil were
painting, in order to give them an opportunity for exchanging those vows
and sentiments which cannot be uttered advantageously in the presence of
a third party: I know not whether she hoped that should her cousin
succeed in carrying off the rich merchant's duughter, he would give Miss
Wirt a portion ot the wealth, which she had enabled him to win-all that
is certain is, thnt Mr, Osborne got some hint of the transaction, cnme
bnck from the City abruptly, and entered the drawing-room with his
bamboo cane; found the painter, the pupil, and the companion all looking
exceedingly pale there; turned the former out of doors with menaces that
he would break every bone in his skin, and half-an-hour afterwards dis-
missed Miss Wit likewise, kicking her trunks down the stairs, trampling on
her band-boxes, and shaking is fist at her lackney coach, as it bore her
away.
Jane Osborne kept her hed-room for many days. She was not allowed
to have a companion afterwards. Her fnther swore to hcr that she should
not lave a shilling of his money if she made any match without his con-
currence; and as he wantel a woman to keep his house, he did not choose
that she should marry : so that she was obliged to givo up all projects
with which Cupid had any share. During her papa's life, then, she resigned
herself to the manner of existence here described, and was contecnt to be
an Old Mnid. Her sister, meanwhile, was having children with finer names
eery year-and thc intercourse between the two grew faintcr continually.,
``Jane anl I do not move in the same sphere of life,'' Mrs. Bullock said.
 I regard her as a sister, of course''-which means-what does it mean
when a lady says that she regards Jane as a sisterf
It has been described how the Misses Dobbin lived with their father at
a fine villa nt Denmark Hill, where therc were bcautiful graperies and
peach-trees which delighted little Georgy Osborue. The Misses Dobbin,
who droe often to Brompton to see our dear Amelia, came sometimes to
Russell Square too, to pay a visit to their old acquaintnnee Miss Osborne.
I believe it was in consequence of the commands of their brother the Major
in India (or whom their papa had a prodigious resnect), that they payed
attention to Mrs. Geore; for the Mjor, the godfather and gunrlian of
Amelia's little boy, still hoped that the child's grandfather might be
induced to relent towards him, and acknowledge him for the sake of his
son. The Miss Dobbins kept Miss Osborne acquainted with the state of
Amelia's affairs; how she was living with her father and mother: how
poor they were : how they wondered what men, and such men as their
brother and dear Captain Osborne, could find in such an insignificant little
chit: how she was still, as heretofore, a namby-pamby milk-nand-water
nffected creature-but how the boy was really the noblest little boy cver
seen-for the hearts of all women warm towards young children, and the
sourest spinster is kind to them.
One day, after great entreaties, on the pnrt of the Misses Dobbin, Amelia
allowed little George to go and pss a day with them at Denmark IIill-a
part of which day she spent herself in writing to the Msjor in Indin. She
congratulated him on the hsppy news which his sisters had just conveyed

to her. She prayel for his prosperity, and that of the bride le had chosen.
She thanked him for a thousand thousand kind oflices and proofs of sted-
fast friendslip to her in her affliction. Bhe told him the last news about
little Georgy, and how he was gone to spend that very day with his sisters
in the couutry. She underlined the letter a great deal, and she igned
herself affectionately his friend, Amelia Osborne. She forgot to send any
message of kindness to Ldy O'Dowd, as her wont was-and did not
mention Glorina by name, and only in italics, as the Major's ride, for
whom she beggel lessings. But the news of the marriage removed the
resere which she had kept up towards him. She was glad to be able to
own and feel how warmly and gratefully she regnrded him-and as for the
idea of being jealous of Glorvina, (Glorvina, indeell) Amelia would hase
scouted it, if an angel from heaven had hintel it to her.
Thnat night, when Georgy came back in the pony-carriage in which he
rejoiced, and in which he was driven by Sir Wm. Dobbin's old coschman,
he had round his neck a fine gold chain and watch. He snid an old ldy,
not pretty, had given it him, who cried and kissed him a great deal. Bit
he didn't like her. He liked grapes very much. Ad he only liked his
mamma. Amelia shrunk and started: the timid soul felt a presentiment
of terror when she leard that tle relations of the child's father had
seen him.
Miss Osborne came baek to give her father his dinner. He had made
a good speculation in the City, and was rather in a good humour that day,
and chanced to remark the agitation under which she laboured. ee What's
the matter, Miss OsborneP'' he deigned to sasy.
The woman burst into tears. ` O, Sir,'' she said,  I'e seen little

opposite to her lid not say a word, but flushed up, and began to tremble
in every limb.

HE astonishel rcader must be called

Bundlegunge, in the Madras divi-
sion of our Indinn cmpire, where
our guallant oll friends of the -th
regiment are quarterel under the
command of the brave Colonel, Sir
Miichael O'Dowl. Time has dealt
kindly with that stout olfficer, as it
loes ordinnrily with men who have

by fatigue of the brain. The Colo-

ance, is as much at home at Mairas as at Brussells, in the cantonment as
under the tents. On the mnrch you saw her at the head of the regiment
zeated on a royal elephant, a noble sight. Mounted on that beast, she has

princes, who have welcomed her and Glorvina into the recesses of their

Peggy O'Dowd is indeed the same as ever: kind in act and thought:
impetuous in temper; eager to command: a tyrant over her Michael: a
lragon amongst all the ladies of the regiment : a motler to all the young
men, hem she tends in their sickness, lefends in all tleir serapes, and with
hom Ldy l'ggy is immensely popular. But the Subalterns' and Captains'
ladies (the Major is unmarried) cubal against her a good deal. liey sy
that Glorvina gives herself airs, and that Peggy herself is intolerably doui-
neering. Bhe interfered with a little congregetion which Mrs. Kirk had got
np, nnd laughed the young men nway from her sermons, stting that a
soldier's wife had no business to be a parson: that Mrs. Kirk would
be much better mending her husbuand's clothes: and, if the regiment
wanted sermons, that she had the finest in the world, those of her uncle,
tho bDean. She abruptly put a termination to a flirtation whieh Lieutenant
Stubble of the regiment had commeneed with the Surgcon's wife, threatening
to come down upon Stuble for the money which he had borrowed from
her (for the young fellow wns still of an cxtravgant turn) unless e broke
off at once und went to the Cane, on sick leave. On the other hand,
she housed and shelterel Mrs. osky who fled from her bungalow one
night, pursued by ler infuriate husband, wieldiug his second brandy
bottle, aud actually earried Posky through the dclirium tremens, and broke
him of the hbit of drinking, which had grown upon that oficer as all evil
habits ill grow upon men. In a word, in adversity she was the best of
comforters, in gool fortune the most troublesome of friends; having a
perfectly good opinion of herself always, and un indomitable resolution to
have her own way.
Among other points, she had made up her mind that Glorvina shoull
marry our old fricnd Dobbin, MIrs. O'Dowd kuew the Mjor's cxpecta-
tions and appreciatel lis gool qualities, and the high elaracter which he
enjoyed in his profession. Glorvina, a very handsome, freshcoloured,
black-haired, blue-eycd young lady, who could ride a horse, or play a sonatta
with any girl out of the Cunty Cark, seemed to be the very person destined
to insure Dobbin's hnppiness-much more than that poor good little weak-
spur'ted Amelia, about whom he used to take on so.-'` Look at Glorvina
enter na room,'' Mrs. O'Dowl would say, '`and compare her with that
poor Mrs. Osborne, who couldn't say bo to a goose. She'd be worthy of
you, Major-you're a quiet man yourself, and want some one to talk for
ye. Aud though she does not come of such good blood as the Malonys
or Molloys, lct me tell ye, she's of an nncient family that any nobleman
might be proud to marry into.''
But hefore she had come to sucl a resolution, anl delermined to sub-
jugate Major Dobbin by her endearments, it must be owned that Glorvina
lmal practisel them a good dcul elsewhere. She hd had a season in
Dublin, and wlo knows how many in Cork, Killarney, and Mnllow She

clergyman t Bath who used her so ill. She hal flirted all thc way to
Mndras with the Captain and chief-mate of :he llamclunder Eest Iudiaman,
and had u season at the Presidency with her brother and MIrs, O'Dowd
who was staying there, while the Major of the regiment as in comand
at thc station. Everybody admired her there: evcryoy danced with
her: bnt no one proposed who was worth the marrying; one or two exceed-
ingly young subalterns sighed after her, and a heardless civilian or two;
but she rcjected these as bencnth her pretensions; annd other and younget
virgins than Glorvinn were married beforc her. There are women, and
handsome women too, who have this fortune in life. They fall in love
with the utmost generosity ; they ride and walk with half the Ary-list,
though they drs neur to forty, and yet the MIiss O'Gradys are Miss
O'Gralys still : Glorvina persistel that but for Lady O'Dowd's unlucky
arrel with the Julge's ldy, she would hase made a good mateh t
Mudras, where old Mr, Chutney, who was at the head of the civil service,
(and who afterwards married Miss Dolby, n young loly, only thirteen
years of age, who lud just arrived from school iu lEurope), was just at thc
point of proposing to her.
Well, although Laly O'Dowd and Glorvina quaellel a great number
of times evary day, and upon almost every conceivakde subjeet-indcel, if
Miek O'Dowd had uot possessed thc temper of nn agel, two such women
constantly tbout his ears would hnve driven him ont ol his scnscs-yet
they agreed between themselves on this point, that dlorvina should marry
Major Dobbin, and were determined that the Major should have no rest
until thearrangement was brought about. Undismayel by forty or fifty
previous defeats, Glorvina laid siege to him. She snng Irish Alelotlies at
him nnceasingly. She asked him so freuently and patletically, will ye
come to the bower? that it is a wonder how any man of fecling could
have resisted the invitation. She wns never tired of inqiiring, if Sorrow
had his young days faled; and was ready to listen and weep like
bDesdemoaat the storles of his duangers and his cnmpaigns. It has been
snaid that our honest and dear old frient used to perform on the flute in
private: Glervi insisted upon aving duets with him, and ILady O'bDowd
would rise and irtlessly quit the room, when thc young couple wcre so
engaged. Glorvina forecd the Mjor to ride with her of mornings. Tho
whole cantonment saw them set out and return. She was constantly
writing notes over to him at his house, borrowing his books, and scoring
with hcr great pencil-marks nh pa-ages of sentiment or humour as
awakened hcr sympathy. hn borowcd his horses, his servants, his
spoons, and palankin;-no wondr that pubkic rumour assigned her to
him, and thatthe MIajor's sisters in England should fancy they were about
to have a sister-inlas.
Dobbin, who was thus yigorously besieged, was in the mennwhile in a
state of the most odious trinquility. He used to laugh when the young
fellows of the regimet joked him about Glorvina's munifest attentions ts
him. t Bah1'' said he, '`she is only keeping her hnnd in-she practises
upon me as she does upon Mrs. Tozer's piano, becausc it's the most
handy instrument in the station. I am much too bnttered and old for
such a fine young lady s Glorviua.'' Aud so he went on riding with hcr,

and copying music nnd verses into her albums, and playing at chess with
her very submissively; for it is with these simple amusements that some
officers in India are accustomed to while away their leisure moments;
while others of n less domestie turn hunt hogs, nnd shoot snipes, or
gamble nnd smoke cheroots, and bctake themselves to brandy-and-water.
As for Sir Michasel O'Dowd, thougl his Lady and ler sister both urged
him to call upon tle Major to explain himself, and not keep on tortur-
ing a poor innocent girl in that shameful wny; the old soldier refused
point-blank to have nnything to do with the conspiracy- 'Faith, the
Major's big euough to choose for himselfr,'' Sir Michael said; `' he'll ask ye
when he wants ye;''-or clse he would turn the matter off jocularly,
leclaring '`that Dobbin was too young to keep house, and had written
home to ask lave of his mamma.'' Nny, he went farther, and in private
commnunications with his Msjor, would cution and rally him-crying,
Mind your oi, Dob, my hoy, them girls is bent on mischief-me Lady
as just got a box of gowns from lurope, and there 's a pink satin for
Glorvina, which will finish ye Dob, if it 's in the power of woman or satin
to mnove ye.''
But the truth is, neither beauty nor fashion could conquer him. Our
onest fricnd had but one idea of a woman in his head, and that one did
not in the least resemble Miss Glorvina O'Dowd in pink satin. A gentle
little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking,
snve when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Mliss
Glorvinn's-a soft young mother tending an infant and beckoning the
Mnjor up with a smile to look at him-n rosy-chcekel lass coming sing-
ing into the room in Russell Square or hanging on George Osborne's
arm happy and loving-there was but this image that filled our
honest Major's mind by day and by night nnd reigned over it always.
Very likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Mjor hnd formed of her 
there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in lnglanl,
and with which William had made away privately, pasting it into the lid
of his desk, and faneying he saw some resemblance to Mrs. Osborne in
thie print, whereas 1 have seen it, and can vouch that it is but the pictur
of a higl-waistel gown with an impossible doll's face simpering over it-
nund, perhaps, Mr. Dobbin's sentimental Amelia was no more like the renl
one than this absur little print which he cherishel. But what man in
loe, of us, is better informed -or is he much happier when he sees and
owns his uclusion Dobbin was under this spell. He did not bother his
frienls and the public much about his feclings, or indeed lose his natural
zest or appctite on account of them. His head has grizzled since we saw
him last; and a line or two of silver may be seen in the soft brown hair
likewise. But his feelings are not in the least changed or oldened; an
his love remains as fresh, as a man's recollections of boyhood are.
WYe have said how the two Miss Dobbins nnd Mmelia, the Mnjors
zorrespondeuts in Europe, wrote him letters from England; Mrs. Osborne
congratuluting him ith great candour and cordiality upon his approaching
nuptials with MIiss O'Dowd.

This letter, which arrivel by the very same slip whicl brought out Lndy
O'Dowd's box of millinery from Lonlon, (and which you may be sure Dobin
 opened before any one of the other packets which the mail brought him),
put the reeeiver into such a state of mind that Glorvina, and her pink
satin, and everything belonging to her became perfectly olious to him.
The Msjor cursed the talk of women : aud the sex in general. Every-
thing annoyed him that day-the parade was insufferably hot and weri-
some. Gool heavensl was a man of intellect to waste his life, day after

dsy, inspecting cross-belts, and putting fools through their manaeuvres
The senseless chatter of the yonng men t mess was more than eer jarring.
What cared he, a man on the high road to forty, to know how many
snipes Lieutenant Smith had shot, or what were the performances of
Lnsign Brown's mareP The jokes about the table filled him with shame.
He was too old to listen to the banter of the assistant-surgeon and the
slang of the youngsters, at which old O'Dowd, with his hald head and
red face, laughed quite easily. The old man had listened to those jokes
any time these thirty years-Dobbin himself had been fifteen years hearing
them. And nfter the boisterous dullness of the mess-table, the quarrels
and scnndnl of the ladies of the regimentl It was unbearable, shameful.
eO Amelia, Anelia,'' he thought, `` you to wlom I have been so fnithful,-
you reproach mel It is because you cannot feel for me, that I drag on
this wearisome life. And you reward me after years of devotion by
giing me your blessing upon my marrisge, forseooth, with this llounting
Irish girll'' Sick and sorry felt poor William: more than ever wretched
nand lonely. He would like to have done with life and its vnnity alto-
gether-so bootless and unsatisfactory the struggle, so cheerless anl dreary
the prospect, seemed to him. He lny all that night sleepless, and yearn-
ing to go home. Amelia's letter had fullen as a blank upon him. No
fidelity, no constant truth and passion, could move her into warmtl. She
ould not see that he loved her. Tossing in his bed, he spoke out to
her. ``ood God, Amelinl'' he said, ``don't you know that I only love
you in the wsorld-you, who are a stone to me-you, whom I tended
through months and months of illness and grief, and who bade me fare-
well with a smile on your face, and forgot me before the door shut between
us1'' The native servants lying outside his verandahs beheld with
wonder the MIajor, so cold nnd quiet ordinarily, at present so passionately
moved anl cast down. Would she have pitied him had she seen him?
He read over and over nll the letters which he ever hnd from her-letters
of business relative to the little property which he had made her beliere
her husband had left to her-brief notes of invitation-every scrap of
writing tht she had cver sent to him-how cold, how kind, how hope-
less, how selfish, they werel
Had there been some kind gentle soul near at hand who could read and
auppreciate this sileut generous heart, who knows but that the reign of Amelia
might have becn over, and that friend William's love might have fiowed
into a kindver channelP But there was only Glorvina of the jetty ringlets
with whom lis intercourse was familiar, and this dashing young woman
was not bent upon loving the MIjor, but rather on making the Major
ndmire er-a most vain and hopeless task too, at least considering the
means that the poor girl possessed to cnrry it out. She eurled her hair
and showed her ehoulders at him, as much as to say, did ye ever see such
jet ringlets anl such a complexion fShe grinned at him so that he might
see thnt every tooth in her hend was sound-and he never heeded all
these charms. Very soon after the arrival of the box of millinery, and
perhaps indcel in honour of it, ILady O'Dowd and the ladies of the King's

the station. Glorvina sported the killing pink froek, and the Maior, who
attended the party nnd walked very ruefuly up and down tle rooms,
never so iuch as perceived tho pink garment. Glorina danced pnst him
in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station, and the Mjor was
not in the least jealous of her performance, or angry because Captain
Bnngles of the Cavulry handed her to supper. - It was not jealousy, or
frocks or shoulders, that could move him, and Glorins had nothing
more.
So these two were each exemplifying the Vanity of this life, and cach
longing for what he or she could not get. Glorvina cried with rage at
the failure. She had set her mind on the Maijor ``more than on any of
the others,'' she owned, sobbing. "` He 'll break my heart, he will, Peggy,''
she would whimper to her sister-in-law when they were good frieuds;
`` sure every one of me frocks must be taken in-it's such a skeleton I 'm
growing.'' Fat or thin, Ianghing or melaneholy, on horseback or the
music-stool, it was all the same to the Major. And the Colonel, puffing
his pipe and listening to thcse complaints, would suggest that Glory
should have some black frocks out in the next box from London, and told
a mysterious story of a laly in Ireland who died of grief for the loss of
her husband hefore she got ere a one.''
While the MInior as going on in this tantalizing way, not proposing,
and declining to fall in love, there came another ship from lurope bringing
letters on board, and amongst them some more for the heartless man.
These were home letters bearing nu enrlier post mnrk than that of the former
packets, and ns Major Dohbin rccognised among his, the handwriting of
his sister, who ualways crossed and recrossed her letters to her brother,
--gathered together all the possible bad news which she could collect,
abusel him and rend him lectures with sisterly frankness, and always left
him miscruble for the day nfter '' dearest William'' had achieved the peru-
sal of one of her epistles-the truth must be told that, learest William
did not hmry himself to break the seal of Miss Dobbin's letter, but wnited
for a particularly favourable day and mool for doing so. A fortnight
before, moreover, he had written to scold her for telling those absurd
stories to MIrs. Osborne, and had despatched a letter in reply to that lady,
undeceiving hecr with respect to the reports concerning him, and assuring
her that '` he had no sort of present intention of altering his condition.''
Two or three nights after the nrrival of the second packnge of letters, the
Mjor hnl passed the evening pretty cheerfully at Ludy O'Dowd's house,
where Glorvina thought that he listened with rather more attention than
usual to the Meeting of the Wathers, the MIinsthrel Boy, and one or two
other specimens of song with which she favoured him, (the truth is, he was
no more listening to Glorvina thau to the howling of thc jnuckalls in tle
moonliglt outside, and the delusion was her's as usual,) and having
played his game at chess with her, (cribbage with the surgeon was Lay
O'Dowd's favourite evening pastie,) Mjor Dobhin took leave of the
Colonel's family at his usunl hour, and retired to his own house.
Ihere on his table, his sister's letter lay reproaching him. IIe took
it up, ashamed rather of his negligence regarding it, and prepared
himself for a disagreeable hour's communing with that crabbed-handed

vAIF FAIR.
. It my have been an hour after the MIujor's
departure from the Colonel's house-Sir Michael ws sleeping the uleep of
the just; Glorvina had arranged her black ringlets in the innuerable
little bits of paper, in which it was her habit to confine then; Lady
(O'Dowd, too, had gone to her bed in the nuptial chamber, on the ground-
floor, and had tucked her musquito curtuains round her fair form, when
the guard at the gates of the Commanding-officer's compound, beheld
MIsjor Dobbin, in the moonlight, rushing towards the housce with a swift
step and a very agitated countenance, and he passed the sentinel and
went up to the windows of the Colonel's bed-chamber,
O'Dowd-ColonelI'' aaid Dobbin, and kept up a great shouting.
Heavens, Meejorl'' ssid Glorina of the curl-papers, putting out her
head too, from her window.
e What is it, Dob, me boyP'' said the Colonel, expecting there was a
hre in the station, or thnt the route had come from head-qunrters.
e I-I must have leave of absence. I must go to England-on the
most urgent private affuirs,'' Dobbin said.
Good heavens, what has happened'' thought Glorvina, trembling
with all the papillotes.
eI want to be off-now-to-night,'' Dobbin continued ; anl the
Colonel getting up, came out to parley with him.
In the postscript of Miss Dobbin's cross-letter-the Major hal just
eome upon a paragraph, to the following effeet :- I drove yesterday to
see your old aeuaintance, Mrs. Osborne. The wretched place they live at,
since they were bankrupts, you know-Mr. S., to judge from a brass plate
on the door of his hut (it is lktle better) is a coal-merchant. The little
oy, your godson, is certainly a fine child, though forward, and inclined
to be saucy and self-willel. But we have taken notice of him as you wieh
it, and have introducel him to his aunt, Miss O., who was rather pleased
with him. Perhaps his grandpapae, not the bankrupt one, who is almost
loting, but Mr. Osborne, of ussell Square, may be induced to relent
towards the child of your friend, lis erring and selfilled son. And
Amelin will not e ill-disposed to give im up. The widow is consoled,
mnd is about to marry a reverend gentleman, the Res. Mr. Binney, one of
the curates of HRBrompton. A poor match. But Mrs. O. is getting old,
mnd I saw a great denl of gray in her hair-she was in very good spirits:
nnd your little godson overate himself at our house. Mamma sends her

hatchment which had bcecn placed there as a
token of mourning for Sir Pitt Crawley's demise,
yet this heraldic emblem was in itself a very
splendid and gaudy piece of furniture, and all
the rest of the mansion became more brilliant
thn it had ever been during the late baronet's
reign. The black outer-coating of the bricks was
removed and they appenrcl with n cheerful blush-
ing face streaked with white: the old bronze lion
of the knocker were gilt handsomely, the railings
painted, and the disallest house iu Great Gnunt
Street, becnme the smnrtest in the whole quarter,
before the green leaves in lampshire had replaced
those yellowing ones which were on the trees in
ueen's Crawlcey avenue when old Sir Pitt Craw-
ley passed under them for the last time.
MA little woman, with a carriage to correspond,
was perpetually seen about this mansion; an
elderly spinster, aceompaned by a little boy,
anlso might be remarked coming thither daily.
It was Miss Briggs and little Rawdon, whose busi-
ness it was to see to the inward renovation of Sir Pitt's house, to supcr-
intend the female band engnged in stitching the blinds and hangings, to
poke and rummsge in the drawvrers and cupboards crmmed with the lirty
relics anl cougregated trumperies of as couple of generations of Ldy
Crawleys, and to take inventories of the china, the glass, anl otle
properties in the elosets and store-rooms.
Mrs. Hawlon Crawley was general-in-chief over these arrangements,
with full orders Irom Sir Pitt to sell, brter, confscte, or purehse furni-
ture : nnd she enjoyed herself not a little in an oceupation which gave full
scope to her taste an ingenuity. The renovation of the house s detes-
mined upon when Sir Pitt came to ton in November to see his lyere.
nnd when he passed nearly a week in Curzon Street, under the roof of his
affectionate brother and sister.
He had put up at an hotel at first; but, Becky as soon as sle heard of
the Baronet's arrival, went off alone to greet him, and returnel in nn hour

were they pressed, so frankly and amiably offered. Becky seized Pitt'a
hnnd in a transport of grtitude when he agreel to come. `Thank you,''
she said, squeezing it, and looking into the Baronet's eyes, who blusheda
good deal 'how happy this will make Rawdon.'' She bustled up about
to Pitt's bed-room, leading on the servants, who were carrying his trunks
thither. She came in herself laughing, with a coal-scuttle out of her

A fire was blazing already in Sir Pitt's apsrtment, (it was Miss Brigg
room, by the wsy, who was sent up stairs to sleep with the msid.)
eI knew I should bring you,'' she said, with pleasire beaming in her
glance. Indeed, she was really and sincerely happy at having him for a
guest.
Becky made Rawdon dine out once or twise on business, while Pitt
stayed with them, and the Baronet passed the happy evening alone with
her and Briggs. She went down stairs to the kitchen and actually cooked
little dishes for him.  Isn't it a good saslmi2'' she said;  I made it for
you. I cnn make you better dishes than that: and will when you come
to see me,''
Everything you do, you do well,'' said the Baronet gallantly.  The
salmi is excellent indeed.''
` A poor man's wife,'' Rebeoca replied gaily, ``must make herself useful,

you know:'' on which her brother-in-law vowed that `` she wns fit to be
the wife of an mperor, and that to be skilful in domestic duties wss
surely one of the most charming of woman's qualities,'' And Sir Pitt
thought with something like mortification of Lady Jane at home, and of n
certain pie which she had insisted upon aking, and serving to him nt
dinner-a most abominable pie.
Besides the salmi, which was made of ILord Steyne's phesants from his
lordship's cottage of Stillbrook, Becky gse her brother-in-law a bottle of
white wine, some that Rawdon had brought with him from France, and had
picked up for nothing, the little story-teller said; whereas the liquor was,
in truth, some White IHermitage from the Mnrquis of Steyne's famous
cellars, which brought fire into the Baronct's pallid cheeks and a glown into
his fecble frame.
Then, when he had drunk up the bottle of etit viu lanc she gave lim
her hand and took him up to the drawing-room, and made him snug on
the sofa by the fire, and let him talk ns she listened with the tenderest
kindly interest, sitting by him, anl hemming n shirt for her denr little
boy. Whenever Mrs. Rawdon wished to be particularly humble and
virtuous, this little shirt used to come out of her work-box. It had got
to be too small for Rawdon long before it was finished, though.
WVell, ebeccea listened to him, she talked to him, she sang to him, she
coaxed him, and cuddlel him, so that hce found himself more and more
glad every day to get back irom the lawyer's at Gray's Inn, to the blazing
fire in Curzon Street-a gladness in which the men of lnw likewise parti-
cipated, for Pitt's harangues were of the longcst-and so that when hc
went away he felt quite a png at departing. How pretty she looked
kissing her land to him from the carringe and waving her handkerchief
when he hnd taken his place in the maill She put the handkerchief to
her eyes once. lIe pulled his sealskin cnp over his, as the coach drove
away, anl, sinking back, he thought to limself how sle respected him and
how he deservcd it, and low Rawdon was a foolish dull fellow who lidn't
half appreciate his wife: and how mum nnd stupid his own wife was
compared to that brilliant little Becky. Becky had hiuted every one of
these things herself, perhaps, but so delicately and gently, that you harlly
knew when or where. And, before they parted, it was agreed that thc
house in London should be redecorated for the next season, and that the
brothers' families slould meet again in the country at Christmas.
I wish you could have got  little money out of him,'' Rawdon snid to
his wife moodily whcn the bBaronet was gone. I should like to gve
somcthing to old Raggles, hanged if I should'nt. It nin't right, you know,
that the old fellow should be kept out of all his money. It may be incon-
venient, an he might let to somebody else besides us, you know.''
eTell lim,'' said Becky, ``tlat as soon as Sir Pitt's affairs are settled,
everyboy will be paid, and give him a little something on accouut.
Here's a cleck that Pitt left for the boy,'' and she took from her bag and
gave her hsband a paper which his brother hnd handed over to her, on
behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys.
The truth is, she had tried personally the ground on which her husband
expressed a wish that she should venture-tried it ever so delicately, and
396

foud it unsafe. Een at a hint about embarrassments, Sir Pilt Crawley
wns off nnd alarmed. And he began a long speech, explaining how
straitened he himself was in money matters; how the tenants would not
pay; how lis ftler's affairs, and the expenses attendant upon the demise
of the old gentleman, had involved him; how he wanted to pay off ineum-
brances; and how the bankers and agents were overdruwn; and Pitt
Crawley ended by making a compromise with his sister-in-law, and giving
her a very small sum for the benefit of her little boy.
Pitt knew how poor his brother and his brother's family must be. It
could not have escaped the notice of such a cool and experienced old diplo-
matist, thut Rawdon's family had nothing to live upon, nand that houses
and carriages are not to be kept for nothing. He knew very well that he
was the proprietor or appropriator of the money, which, aecording to all
propcr cnlculation, ought to have fallen to his younger brother, and he had,
we may be sure, some seeret pangs of remorse within him, which warned
lim that he ought to periform some act of justiee, or, let us say, compeus-
tion, towards these disappointed relations. A just, decent an, not without
brains, who said his prayers, and knew his catechism, and did his duty
outwardly througl life, le could not be otherwise than aware that some-
thing was due to his brother at his hands, nnd that morally he was
Rnwdon's creditor.
But, as one rends in the columns of the Tnes newspaper every now
nnd then, queer announcements from the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Icknowledging the receipt of E50 from A. B., or El0 from W. T., as
conscience-money, on account of taxes due by the said A. B. or WY. T.,
which payments the penitents beg the Right Honourable gentleman to
acknowledge through the medium of the public press;-so is the Chan-
cellor no loubt, and the reader likewise, always perfectly sure that the
bove-named A. B. and W', T, are only paying n very small instalment
of what they really owe, and that the man who sends up a twenty pound-
note has very likely hundreds or thousands more for which he ought to
necount. Suich, nt least, are my feelings, when I see A. B. or W. T.'a
insuflicient acts of repentance. And I have no doubt that Pitt Craley's
contrition, or kindness if you will, towards his younger brother, by whom
he had so much profited, was only a very small dividend upon the cspital
sum in which he wus indebted to Rawdon. Not everybody is willing to
pay even so much. To part with money is a sacrifice beyond almost all
men endowed with n sense of order. There is scarcely any man alive
whio does not think himself meritorious for giving his neighbour five pounds.
Thriftless gives, not from a beneficent pleasure in giing, but from a lazy
lelight in spending. He would not deny himself one enjoyment ; not his
opera-stall, not his horse, not his dinner, not even the pleasure of giving
Lazarus the five pounds. Tlrifty, who is good, wise, just, and owes no
man a penny, turns from a beggar, haggles with a hackney-coachman, or
denies a poor relation, and I doubt which is the most selfish of the two.
Money has only a different vulue in the eyes of each.
So, in a word, Pitt Crawley thought he would do something for his
brother, and then thought that he would think about it some other
time.
A NOYEL WIIOUT A HER0.

And with regard to Becky, she was not a womnn who expected too
much from the generosity of her neighbours, nnd so was quite content
with all thnt. Pitt Crawley had done for her. She was acknowledged by
the heal of the family. If litt would not give her anything, he would
get something for her some duy. If she got no money from her brother-
in-law, she got what was as good as money,-credit. Ragglcs was made
rnther easy in his mind by the spectacle of the union between tle brothers,
by a small payment on the spot, and by the promise of a much largcr
sum speedily to be assigned to him. And Reheccn told Miss riggs,
whose Clristmas dividend upon the little su lent by her, Becky paid
with nn nir of candid joy, and as if her exchequer wns brimming oven
uith gold-Rlebecea, we say, told Miss Briggs, in strict confilence, tht
she had couferred with Sir Pitt, who was famous as a finncier, on bBriggs's
special hehalf, as to the most profitable investment of Miss B,'s remain-
ing capital; thut Sir Pitt, after much consideration, had thought of a most
safe nnd advantageous way in wlicl Briggs could lny out her money;
thnt, beinug cspecinlly interestel in her as nn nttached iriend of the late
Miss Crawley, anl of the wvhole fily, and tht long before he left town, hc
had recommended that she slould be ready with the money ut a moment's
notice, so as to purchasse at the most favouruable opportunity the shares
hich Sir Pitt had in his eye. Poor Miss Briggs was very grateful for
this mark of Sir Pitt's attention-it came so unsolicited, she snid, for she
neve should have thought of removing the money from the fnds-and
the delicacy enhanced the kindness of the office; and she promisel to see
her man of business immediately, and be rendy with ler little cssh at the
proper hour.
And this worthy womnn was so grateful for the kiuness of Rcbeeca in
the matter, and for that of her generous benefactor, the Colonel, thnt she
went out and spent a grcat part of her hulf year's dividend in the purchasa
of a llnck vclvet cont for little Rawdon, who ly the way was grown almost
too bi for black velvet now, and was of a size and nge bcfitting him for
the assmption of the virile jaekct and pantaloons.
IIe was n fine open faced boy, with blue eyes and waving flaxen hair, sturly
in limb, but generous and aoft in hcart: fondly attaching himseif to nll who
weregool tohim-to the pony-to Lorlsouthdown, who gare him the horsa

man)-to the graom who had chnrge of the pony-to Molly, the cook, who
crammed him with ghost stories at night, and with good things from the
linner-to IBriggs, whom he plagued nd laughel at-and to his father
cspecially, whose attachment towards the lad was curious too to witness.
klere, as he grew to be about eight years old, his attachments may be
said to have ended. The benutiful mother-vision hal faded away after
a while. During near two years she had scarcely spoken to the child.
She disliked him. He had the measles and the hooping-cough. He
bored her. One day when he was standing at the landing-place, having
crept down from the upper regions, attracted by the sound of his mother's
voice, who wns singing to Lord Steyne, the drwiug-room door opening
suddenly, discovered the little spy, who but a moment before had been
rapt in delight, and listening to the music.

HIis mother came out and struck him violently a couple of boxes on the
ear. IIe henrd a laughi from the Marquess in the inner room, (ho was
nmusel by this free and artless exhibition of Becky's temper,) and fled
down below to his friens of the kitchen, bursting in an ngony of grief.
 It is not ecause it hurts me,'' little Rawdon gasped out-``only-
only''-sobs and tears wound up the sentence in a stormn. It was the
little boy's henrt tht was bleeding.  Why myn't I hear her singing:
Why don't she ever sing to me-as she does to that bald-headed man
with the large teethP'' IIle gasped out at various intervals these excla-
matious of rage and grief. The cook looked at the housemaid: the
housemaid looked knowingly at the footman-the awful kitclen inqui-
sition wlich sits in judgment in every house, and knows everything,-sate
on ebecca at that moment.
After tlis incident, the mother's dislike increasel to lntred; tle con-
sciousness that the clild was in the house was a reproach aud a puin to
er. 1lis very sight annoyed her. Fear, doubt, nnd resistance spruang
up, too, in the boy's own bosom. They were separated from that day of
the boxes on thc ear.
Lord Steyne also heartily mislikedl the boy. When they met by mis-
chance, he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child, or glared ant him
with savage-looking eyes. Rawdon used to stare him in the face, anl
louble his little fists in return. He knew his enemy; an this gentle-
man, of nll who came to the house, was the one wlo angered him most.
One day the footman founl him squaring his fists at Lord Steyne's lat
in the hall. The footman told the circumstance as a gool joke to Lord
Steyne's coachman; tlat officer imparted it to Lod teyne's gentleman,
and to the servants' hall in gcneral. And very soon afterwards, when
Mrs. Rawdon Crawley made her appenrance at Guunt House, the porter
who unbarred the gates, the serants of all uniforms in the hall, tho
funcetionaries in white wnisteonts, who bawled ont from landing to landiug
the names of Colonel and MIrs. Hawdon Crawlcy, knew aout her, or
fancied thcy did. The man wlo brought her refreshment and stool behind
her chair, hnd tnlked her eharneter oer with the large gentleman in

And, I shame to say, she would not have got crelit had they not
believel her to be guilty. It ws the sight of the Marquis of Steyne's

ness of midnight, `` that kep him up,'' as he afterwards said; that, even
more thnn llcbeeca's arts and coaxings.
And so-guiltless very likely-she was writhing and pushing onward
towards what they call ``'a position in society,'' and the servants were
pointing at her as lost anl ruined. So you see Molly the housemaid of n

the thread and tle artificer.
A day or two belore Christmas, ecky, hcr husbnd nnd her son made
ready nnd went to pass the holydays at the seat of their ancestors at
Gueen's Crawley. Beeky would have likcd to leave the little brnt behind,
aud would but for Lady Janc's urgent invitations to the youngster; and
the symptoms of revolt and diseontent whieh Rawdon manifested at her
neglect of her son. He's the fiuest boy in England,'' the father said, in
n tone of reproach to her, `" and you don't secm to care for him, Becky, as
much as you do for your spaniel. Ie shan't bother you much: at home
he will be away from you in the nursery, and he shall go oulside on the
coach with me.''
Where you go yourelf beeause you want to smoke those filthy cigars,''
repliel Mrs. Rawdon.
 I remember when you liked 'em though,'' answered the husband.
Becky laughed: she was almost always good-humourel.  hat was
when I was on my promotion, Goosey,'' she said. `` Tnke Rawdon outside
with you, and give him a cigar too if you like.''
Rawlon did not warm his little son for the winter's journey in this
way, but he anl Briggs wrapped up the child in shawls and comforters,
and he wns hoistel respectfully on to the roof of the couch in thc dark
uorning, under thc lamps of the White Horse Cellar: nand with no small
lelight he watched the dawn rise, and made lis first journey to the place
which his fanther still cnlled home. It was a journey of infinite plesurc
to the boy, to whom the incilents of the road aforlel endless interest;
his father answering to him all questions conectel with it, anl telling
im who livel in the great white house to the right, and whom the park
belonged to. His motler, inside the velicle with her maid and her furs,
her wrappers, and her scent bottles, made such a to-do that you would
hve thought sle never lad been in a stage eonch before-much less, that
she had been turned out of this very one to make room for a pnying
passenger on a certain journey performed some half-score ycars ago.
It was dark again when little Rawdon was wakened up to enter is
uncle's carriage at Mudhury, and he sate and looked out of it wondering
ns the great iron gates flew open, and at the white trunks of the limes ns
they swept ly, until they stopped, at length, before the light windows of
the HIall, which were blazing and comfortable with Christmas welcome.

the old Turkey one that used to e in the Ladies' Gallery,'' thought
ebecca, anl the next instant was kissing Lady Jane.
She and Sir Pitt performed the same salute with great grasity : but
Rawdon haing been smoking, hung back rather from his sister-in-law,
whose two children came up to their cousin; and, while Matilda held out
her hanl nnd kissed him, Pitt Binkie Southdon, the son and heir,
stood aloof rather, and examined him as a little dog does a big dog.
Then the kind hostess conducted her guests to the snug apartments
lazing with chieerful fires. Then the young ladies came and knocked at
MIrs. Rawdon's door, under the pretence that they were desirous to be
useful, but in renlity to have the pleasure of inspecting the contents of her
banl and bonnet-boxes, and her dresses which, though black, were of the
newst I.orndon faslion. Aud they told her how much the Hall was changed
for the btter, and how old Lndy Southdown was gone, and how Pitt was
tking his station in the country, as became a Crawley in fact. Then the
great dinner-bell having rung, the family assembled at dinner, at whieh
mcal lawdon Junior was placed by his aunt, the good-natured laly of the
louse; Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his sister-in-law at his
own riht hnnd.
Little Ilawlon exhibited a fine appetite, and showed a gentlemanliks
bchaviour.
I Iike to dine here,'' he said to his aunt when hc had completel his
cal, at the conclusion of which, and after a decent grce by Sir Pitt, the
young son nand eir was introduccd, and was perched on a high chair by
the baroet's side, while the dnughter took possession of the place and
the little wine-glass preparel for her near her mother. `I like to dine
hore,'' said Rawdon Minor, looking up at his relation's kind face.
 WIy '' anid the good Lady Jane.
:I dine in the kitchen when I am at home,'' repliel Rawdon Minor,
`' or else with Briggs.'' But Beeky was so engaged with the baronet, her
host, pouring out a flood of compliments and delights and raptures, apd
admiring young Pitt linkie, whom she declared to be the most beautiful,
intelligent, noble looking little crcature, and so like his father, that she did
not henr the remarks of her own flesh and blood at the other end of the
brond shining table.
As a gaest, and it being tle first niglt of lis arrisal, Rawdon the Seconl
was allowed to sit up until the hour when tea bcing over, nnd a great gilt
hook being laid on the table before-Sir Pitt, all the domesties of the family
streamed in, and Sir Pitt reatd prayers. It was the first time the poor
little boy had ever witnessed or heard of such a ceremonial.
The house had been much improed even since the Baronet's brief reign,
nd was pronouneed by Becky to be perfect, charming, delightful, when
she surveyel it in his company. As for little Rawdon, who examined it
with the children Ior his guides, it seemed to him a perfect palace of
enchantment and wonder. There were long galleries, and ancient state-
bed rooms, there were pictures and old china, and armour. There were
the rooms in which Grandpapa died, nnd by which the children wulked
with terrified looks. ee Who was Grandpapa ?'' he asked; and they told

house in wlich it had lin since the old gentleman had been wheeled
away yonder to the church, of which the spire was gliltering over the
park elms.
The brothers had good ocecupation for several mornings in examining the
improvements which had been effected by Sir Pitt's genius and economy.
And as they walked or rode, and looked at them, they coull talk without
too much boriug each other. And Pitt took care to tell Rawdon what as
heavy outlay of money these improvements had oeeasioned; and that
a man of landed and funded property was ofte very hard pressedl for
twenty pounds. There is that new lodge gate,'' sail Pitt, pointing to it
humbly with the bamboo cne, ``I can no more pay for it before thc
diidends in January thn I can fly.''
`I can lend you, Pitt, till then,'' Rawdon answered rather ruefully;

Lady Jane very seldom had a hand in it), and in return Pitt and his wife
most energetically dined out in all sorts of wenther, and at all sorts of
distances. For though Pitt did not care for joviality, being a frigid man
of poor health and appetite, yet he considered tlat to be hospitable and
eondescending was quite incumbent on his station, and every time that he
got a henlache from too long an nafter-dinner sitting, he felt that he as

returu of the family from an oratorio at Winehester, the RBaronet
announced to the young ladices that he should next year very probnbly
take them to the county balls.'' They worshippel him for his kind-
ness. Lady Jane was only too obedicnt, and perhaps glnd herself to
go. The bDowager wrote off' the direst descriptions of her daughter's
worldly bchaviour to the nuthloress of the ` Wnsherwoman of Finelley
Common'' at the Cape; and her house in lrighton being bout this time
unoceupicd, returued to that watering-place, her absence being not very
much deplorcd by her children. We mey suppose, too, that kebccea, on
paying a secoud visit to ueen's Crawley, did not feel particularly grievel
at the absence of the lady of the edicine-chest; though she wrote a
Christmas letter to hcr ladyship, in which she respectfully recnlled herself
to Lady Southo's recolleetion, spoke with gratitude of the delight
which ler ladyship's coversation had given hor on the former visit,
dilatel on the kininess witl which her ladyship had treated her in sick-
ness, nnd declared that cverything at ueen's Crwley reninded her of
lcr abscnt fricnl.
A great pnrt of the altered demeanour nnd popularity of Sir Pitt
Crawley ight hue been truced to tle counsels of tlat astute little lady
of Curzon 5tretct. `` Io remain n baronet-you conseut to be a mere
couutry genutleman,'' she snid to him, while he had been her gucst in
London. t No, Sir itt Crawley, I kuow you bctter. I know your
talents and your ambition. ou fancy you hide them both: but you cnn
conceul neithcr from me. I showed Lorl Steyne your pamphlet on malt.
IIe was familiar with it: and said it was in the opinion of the whole Cubinet
the most masterly thing that had appeared on the subject. The Ministry
has its eye upon you, and I know what you want. ou want to distin-
guish yourself in larliament; every one says you are the finest speaker in
Lngland (for your speeches at Oxford are still remembered.) You want to
be Meber for the County, where with your own vote and your borough
at your bck, you c command anything. And you want to be RBaron
Crawley of ueen's Crawlcy, and will be before you lie. I saw it all. I
could rend your heart, Sir 1itt. If I hal a husband who possessed your
intelleet as hc does your name, I sometimes think I slould ot be unworthy
of lim-but-but I am your kinswomn now,'' she added with a lnugh.
Poor little penniless I have got a little interest-and who knows, perhaps
the mouse may be uble to aid the lion,''
Pitt Crawley was anazed and enraptured with her speech. ``IIown tht
woman comprcheuls mel'' he snaid. ``I never could get Jnne to read these
pages of the malt-pampllet. Sle las no idea that I have commanding
talents or secret ambition. So they remember my speaking at Oxford, do
tey? The rascalsl now that I represent my borough and may sit

the levee last year: they are beginning to find out that Pitt Crawley is
some one at last. es, the man was always the same whom thcse peoplc
eglected: it was only the opportunity that was wanting, and I will show
them ow that I can speak and nct as well as write. Achilles did not
declare himself until they gave him the sword. I hold it now, and the
world slall yet hear of Pitt Crnwley.''
Therefore it was that this roguish iplomatist had grown so hcspitable;
that he was so civil to oratorios and hospitals; so kind to Deans and
Chapters; so generous in giving and accepting dinners; so uncomnonly
gracious to farmers on market-days; and so mucl interestced abot county
business; and thnt the Christmas at the IIall was the geyest wlich had
been known there for mny a long duy.
On Christmas day a great family gathering took place. All the Craw-
leys from the ectory came to dine. ebecea was as frank and fond of
Mrs. Bute, as if the other had never been her cnemy, nffectionately
iuterested in the der girls, and surprised at the progress wlich they had
nale in music since her time: and insisted upon encoring one of the
luets out of the great song-books which Jim, grumbling, hnd been forced
to bring under his arm from the eetory. Mrs. Butec, perforce, was
obliged to adopt a decent demeanour towards tle little adventuress-of
course being free to discourse with er dnughters afterwards about the
absurd respect with which Sir Pitt treated his sister-in-law. But Jim, who
had sate next to hcr at dinner, declared she was a trump: and one nnd all
of the Rector's family agreed that the little Rawlon ws a fne boy. They
respected a possible baronet in the boy, between whom and thc title there
was only the little sickly pale Pitt Binkie.
The children were very good friends. Pitt Binkie was too little a dog
for such a big dog as Rawlon to play with : and MIatilda bcing only a
girl, of course not fit companion for a young gentleman who was near eight
years old, and going into jackets very soon. He took the command of
tlis small party at onee-the little girl and the little boy following him
bout with great reerence at such times as he condescended to sport
with them. His happiness and pleasure in the country were extreme.
he kitchen-garden pleased him hugely, the flowers moderately, but thc
pigeons and the poultry, and the stables when he was anllowed to visit them,
were delightful oljeets to him. He resisted being kissed by the Miss
Crawleys: but he allowed Lady Jane sometimes to embrace hin: nnd
it was by her sile that he likel to sit when the signal to retire to the
lrawing-room being given, the ladies left the gentlemen to their claret-
by her side rather than by his mother. For Rebecca seeing that tenderness
was the fashion, called Rawdon to her one evening, and stooped down and
kissed him in the presence of all the lalies.
He looked her full iu the face after the operation, trembling and
turning very red, as his wont was when moved. :You never kiss me
nt home, Mamma,'' he sid; at which there was a general silence and
consternation, and a by no means pleasant look in Becky's eyes.
Rawdon was fonl of his sister-in-law, for her regard for his ason. Lndy
Jane and Becky did not get on ite so well at this visit as on occasion of
the forer one, when thc Colonel's wife was bet wupon pleasiug. Those

two speechcs of the child struek rather a chill. Perhaps Sir Pitt was
rather too attcntive to her.
But wdon, as beeame his nge and size, was fonder of the society of
the men than of the women; and never wenried of accompanying his sire
to the stables, whither the Colonel retired to smoke his cigar-im, the
Rector's son, sometimes joining lis cousin in that and other amusements.
HIe nud the Baronet's keeper were very close friends, their mutual taste
for ``dawgs '' bringing tlem much togethcr. On one iay, Mr. Jnmes,
thic Colonel, and llorn, the keeper, went anl shot pheasants, taking little
Rawdon with them. On another most blissful morning, these four
gcntlemen partook of the amusement of rat-hunting in a barn, as which
sport Rudon as yet had never seen ayting so noble. They stopped
p the ends of certain drains in the bnrn, into the other openings of which
ferrets wverc inserted; and then stood silently aloof with uplifted stakes in
their hands, and an anxious little terrier (Mr. James's celebrated `' dawg''
Forceps, iudeed,) scnrcely breathing from excitement, listening motionless
on three lcgs, to thle faint squeaking of the rats below. Desperately
hold nt last, the persecutcd animals bolted above-ground: the terrer
arccountel for one, the keeper for anothcr, Rawdon, from flurry nnd
excitement missed his rat, but on the other hund he hulf-murdered n
ferret.
But the greutest dnay of all was tlat on which ir Huldlestone Fuddle-
stone's hounds mct upon the lawn at ueen's Crawley,
That was n famous sight for little awdon. At half-past ten, Tom
Moody, Sir Huddlestoue Fudllestone's huntsman, is seen trotting un the
avenue, followel by the noble pack of hounds in a compact body-thi
rear bcing brought up by the two whips clad in stained scarlet frocks-
light hard-fcatured lals on well-bred lean horses, possessing marvellonus
dexterity in cnsting the points of their long hevy whips at the thinnest
part of nny dog's skin who dares to straggle from the main body, or to
tnke the slightest notice, or even so much as wink at the hares and
rabbits starting under their nose.
Next comes boy Jnck, Tom Moody's son, who weighs five stone, mea-
sures cight-and-forty inches, and will never be any bigger. Ie is perched
on a large raw-boned hunter, half-covered by a capacious snddle. This
animal is Sir luddlestone Fuddlestone's favourite horse-the Nob. Other
horses, ridlen by other small boys, arrive from time to time, awaiting their
mnsters, who will come cantering on anon.
Tomn Mooly rides up to the door of the Hall, where he is welcomel by
thce butler, who offers him drink, which he declines. He and his pnek
then draw off into a sheltered eorner of the lawn, where the dogs roll on
the grass, and play or gronl angrily at one another, ever and anon
breaking out into furious fight speedily to be quelled by Tom's voice,
unmatched at rating, or the snaky thongs of the whips.
Many young gentlemen canter up on thorough-bred hacks, sputter-
dashed to the knee, and enter the house to drink cherry-brandy and pay
their respects to the ladies, or more modest and sportsman-like, divest
themselves of their mud-boots, exchange their hacks for their hunters, and
warm thir blood by a preliminary gullop round the lawn. Then they

oollect round the pack in the corner, and talk with Tom MIoody of psst
sport and the nerits of Sniveller and DDiamond, and of the state of the
country and of the wretche breed of foxes.
Sir IIuddlestone presontly appears mounted on a clever cob, and rides
up to the Hall, where he enters and does the civil thing by the ladies,
anfter which, bcing a man of few words, he proceeds to business. The
hounds are drawn up to the HInall-door and little Rawdon descends amongst
them, excitcd yet half alarmed by the caresses which they bestow upon
him, at the thumps he receives from their waving tails, and at their canine
bickerings, scarecely restrainel by Tom Moody's tongue and lash.
Meanwhile, Sir Hulllestone hns hoisted himself unwieldily on the Nob:
Let's try Sowster's Bpinney, Tom,'' says the Baronet, '' Farmer Mangle
tells me there are two foxes in it.'' Tom blows his horn and trots off,
ollowed by the pack, by the whips, by the young gents from Winchester,
by the farmers of the neighbourhood, by the lahourcrs of the parish on
foot, with whom the day is a great holiday; Sir Hudllestone bringing up
tle rear with Colonel Crawley, nd the whole cortge disappears down
the avenue.
The everenl Bute Crawley (who hns heen too modest to nppear at
the public meet before his nephew's wiudows), and whom om Mloody

jumping thoe widest brooks, and larking ower the newest gates in the

Lanc ou his powerful black horsc, just as Sir Huddlestone passes; he
joins te worthy barouet. Ilounls and horsemen disappear, and little
Rawdon remains on the door-stcps, wondering and happy.
During the progress of this memorable holiduy, little Rwdon, if he had
got no spccial liking for his uncle, alvays awful and cold, an locked up
in his study plunged in justice-business and surrounded by bailiffs and
farmers-has gained the good graces of his married and maiden aunts, of
the two little folks of the lIall, and of Jim of the lectory, whom Sir Pitt is
encouraging to pay his nddresses to one of the young ladies, with an
nnderstanding doubtlcss thnt he shall be presented to the living when it
shall be vacated by lis fox-hunting old sire. Jim las gien up that sport

which he will return to the University and try and not be plucked, onee
ore. le has nlready eschewed grecn conts, red uecekcloths, and other
worldly ornnrents, and is preparing himself for a change in his condition.
In this cheap and thrifty wy Sir Pitt tries to pay off his debt to his
family.
Also before this merry Christmas was over, the Baronet had serewed up
courage enough to give his brother nnother draft on his bankers and for
no less a sum than a hnldred nounds, an aet which caused Sir Pitt
cruel pungs at first, but which made him glow afterwards to think himself
one of the most generous of men. lawdon and his son went away with
the utmost heaviness of hcnrt. Beky and the ladies pnrted with some
alacrity, however: and our friend returned to London to comence those

nvocations with which we find her occupied when this chapter begins.
Under her care the Crawley House in Great Gaunt Street wvas quite
rejuvenescent, and realy for the reception of Sir Pitt and his fumily,
when the Baronet came to london to attend lis duties in Parliament,
nd to assume that position in the country for which his vast genius
fitted him.
For the first session, this profound dissembler hid his projects and ncver
opened his lips but to present a petition from Mudbury. But he attended
nssiduously iu lis place, and learued thoroughly the routine nnd business
of the house. At home he gnve himself up to the perusal of Blue
Books, to the nlarm and wonder of Lndy Jane, who thought he was killing
himself by late hours and intense application. And he made acquaintance
with thc miuisters, and the chiefs of his party, determining to rank as
one of them before many yenrs were oer.
Lndy Jane's sweetness and kindness had inspired Rebecca with such a
contempt for her lalyship as the little woman tound o smnll difficulty ir
coneceuling. Thnt sort of gooduess and simplicity which Lady Jane posscssed
nnnoyed our friend Becky, and it was impossible for hcr at times not to
show, or to let the other divine er scorn. Her presence, too, renderel
Lady Jane uneasy. Iler husbnd talked constantly with Becky. Signs
of intclligence seemed to pass letween them: and Pitt snoke withl ler o
subjects on which he never thought of discoursing with Idy Jane. The
latter did not understand thcm to be sure, but it wass mortifying to renain
silent; still uore mortilying to know that you had nothing to say, and
henr that littlo audncious Mrs. Rawdon dasling on from subject to sub-
jcct, with n word for every man, and a joke ulways pat; and to sit in
one's own lousealoue, by thc fireside, and watching all the men round
yonr rival.
In the country, when ndy Jane ws telling stories to the children, who
clusterced about her knes, (little Rawdon into the bargnin, who was very
fond of her)-and Bucky came into the room, sneering, with green scornful
eyes, paoor ILady Jan grewn silent nder those balcful glancee. Her
simple little fancies shrank away tremuloualy, as fairies in the story-looks,
hefore n superior bad angel. She could not go on, although Rebecca,
with the smallest inflection of sarensm in her voice, besought her to con-
tinue that charming story. And on her side, gentle thoughts and simple
pleasures were odious to Mrs. Becky, they discorded with her; she
hated people for liking them; she spurued chillren nnd cillren-lovers.
 I have no taste for brend nnd buttcr,'' sle would say, when caricnturing
Laly Jane and her ways to my Lord Steyne.
No more has n certain person for holy water,'' his lordship rcplicd with
a bow and a grin, and a great jarring laughi afterwards.
So these two lndies did not see much of each othcr except upon those
occasions, when the younger brother's wife, having an object to gain from
the other, frequentel her. They my-loved and my-dcured cach other
assiduously, but kep apart generally: whereas Sir Pitt, in the midst of
his multiplicd avocations, founl daily time to see his sister-in-law.
On the ocecasion of his first Speakcr's dinner, Sir Pitt took the oppor-

Becky complimented him upon that dress, and admired him almost as
much as his own wife and children, to whom he displayed himself before
he set out. Shc said that it was only the thorough-bred gentleman that
could wear the Court suit with alvantasge: it was only your men of ancient
race whom the culotte ecourte became. Pitt looked down with ecompla-

by the deference with which the great Peer treated his sister-in-law, by
her ease nnd sprightliness in the conversation, and by the delight with
which the other men of the party listened to her talk. Lord Steyne made
no doubt but that the baronet hnd only commenced his career in publio

House, as everybody knows, forms one side) my lord hoped that as soon
as Laly Steyne arrived in London she would have the honour of making
the acquaintance of Lady Crawley. He left a card upon lis neighbour in

were meanwhile passing their
a-


Christmas after their fashion,
and in a manner by no means
too cheerful.
Out of thc hundred pounds
a ycar, which was about thc
tount of her income, the
widow Osborne had becn in
tle habit of giving up nearly
three-fourths to hcr father
anl mother, for the expenses
of hcrself and ler little boy.
With A120 more, supplied
by Jos., this family of tfour
people, attended by a single
Irish servant who also did for
Clapp and his wife, might
mnnage to live in deccnt com-
fort through the year, and hold up their heads yet, an be able to givea
friend a dish of ten still, nfter the storms and lisappointments of their
cnrly life. Sedley still maintained lis ascendancy over the family of
Ir. Clapp, his ex-clerk. Clapp remembered the time when, sitting on
1he edge of tle chair, he tossed off a bumper to the health of ` Mrs.S---,
liss Lmmy, and Mr. Joseph in Inlia,' at the merchant's rich table in
lussell Square. Time magnified the splendour of those recollections in the
honest clerk's bosom. Every time he ce up from the kitchen-parlour
to the drawing-room, and partook of tea or gin-aud-water with Mr. Sedley,
he would sny, '` This was not wht you was accustomed to once, Sir,'' and
ns gravely and reverentially drink the health of the ldies as he ad
lone in the days of their utmost prosperity. He thought Miss 'lelia's
playing the diviest music ever performed, and er the finest lady. He
ever would sit down before Sedley at the club even, nor would he have
that gentleman's charcter abused by any member of thce society. He
hal seen the first men in London shaking hanls with Mr. S-; he
snid, `` Ie'd known lim in times when Rothschild might be seen on Change
with him any day, and he owed him personally everythink.''
Clapp, with the best of characters and hand-writings, had been able cry
soon after his master's disaster to find other cmployment for hiself.
A NOYEIL wITO A IIERO.
4I1
 Such a little fish as me cnn swim in any bueket,'' he used to remark,
nnd n member of the house from whieh old Sedley had seeeded was very
glad to make use of Mr, Clapp's services, and to reward them with a com-
fortable salary. In fine, all Sedley's wealthy friends had droppel off
one by one, and this poor ecx-depenlent still remaine fuithfully attched
to him.
Out of the small residue of her income, whieh Amelin kept back for
herself, the widow had need of all the thrift mnd cnre possible in order to
enable her to keep ler dnrling boy dressed in such a maer ns became
Georgc Osborne's son, and to defray the expenses of the little school to
which, after much misgiving and reluctance, and many secret pngs and
fears on her own part, she hnd been induced to scud the lnd. Sue hnd
sate up of nights conning lcssons and spcelling over crabbed gammars and
geography books in order to tench them to Georgy. She had worked
even nt the Iatin accidence, fondly hoping thnt sle might be capble of
instrncting him in that language. To part with him all day: to send
lim out to the mercy of n schoolmnster's cane and his schoolfellows'
roughness, was almost like weaning him over agnin, to that weak mother,
so tremulous and full of sensibility. IHIc, for lis part, rushed off to tho
sclool with the utmost happiness. He was longing for the change. Thnt
childish glndness woundel his mother, who was herself so grieved to part
with him. Shc would rather have hnl hi more sorry, she thought : and
then wns dceply repentant within lcrself, for during to be so selfish ns to
wish er own son to be unhappy.
Georgy made great progress in the school, which was kept y a friend of
his mother's constant admirer, tle Res. Mr, Binney. IIe brought ome
numberless prizes and testimouials of ability. IIe told his mother count-
less stories eery night about his school-companions: and what a fine
fellow Lyons was, and what n snenk Sniffin was: nnd how Steel's father
actually supplied the meat for the establishment, whereas Golding's mother
came in a carringe to fetch him every Saturday : and how Nent had straps
to his trowsers,-might he have straps anl how Bull Major was so strong
(though only in Lutropius) thnt it wns hclievet le conld lick the Usher,
Mr, Ward himself. So Mmelia lcarued to know cvery one of the boys in
that school as well as Georgy himself: and of nights she used to help him
in his exercises and puzzle her little head over his lessons as engerly us if
she wns hcrself going in the morning into the presence of the master.
Once, after a certain combat with Master Smith, George cmc home to his
mother with a black cye, and brngged proligiously to lis parent and his
delighted old granlfuther ubout his valour in the fight, in which, if the
truth was known, he did not behave with particular lcroism, and in which
he decidedly had the worst. But Amelia has never forgiven that Smith
to this lay, though he is now a peaceeful apothecary near Lcicester
Bquare.
In these quiet labours and harmless cares the gentle widow's life was
passing away, a silver hnir or two marking the progress of time on her
head, and a line deepening ever so little on her fuir forehenl.. Slie used
to smile at these marks of time. e hat matters it,'' she asked, `for

great, famous, and glorious, as he desered to be. She kept his copy-
books, his drawings, anud compositions, and showed them about in Ilnr
little circle, as if they were mircles of genius. She confided some otf
these specimens to Miss Dobbin : to slow them to Miss Osborne, George's
aunt, to show them to Mr. Osborne himself-to make that old rcn
repent of his cruelty and ill-feeling towards him who was gone. All her
husband's faults and foibles she had buried in the grave with him: she
only remembered the lover, who hnd married her at all sacrifices : tle
noble husband so brae and beautiful, in whose nrms she had hung on
the morning when he had gone away to fight, and die gloriously for his
king. From heaven the hero must be smiling down upon that paragon
of a boy whom he had left to eomfort and console her.
We have seen how one of George's grandfathers (Mr. Osborne), in
his easy chair in Russell Square, daily grew more violent nnd moody,
and how his duughter, with her fine carriage, and her fine horses, and
her name on half the public charity-lists of the town, was a louely,
miserable, persecuted old maid. She thought again and again of the
beautiful little boy, her brother's son, whom she had seen. She longed
to be allowed to drive in the fine carriage to the house in which he lived:
and she used to look out day after day as she took her solitary drive in
the Park, in hopes that she might see him. Her sister, the banker's lady,
occasionally condescended to pay her old home and eompanion a visit in
llussell Square. Ehe brought a couple of sickly clildren attended by a
prim nurse, and in a faint genteel giggling tone cackled to hcr sister
nbout her fiue acquaintance, and how her little Frederick was the imnge of
Lord Claud Lollypop, and hcr sweet Maria had been noticed by the
Baroness as they were drising in tleir donkey-chaise at Roehampton.
She urged her to make her papa do something for the dnrlings. Fre-
derick she had letermined should go into the Guards ; and if they made
an elder son of him (ud Mr. Bullock was positively ruining and pinehing
himself to deathto buy land), how was the lnrling girl to be provided for
I cxpeet yo, dear,'' Mrs. Bullock would say, `' for, of course my share
of our Papa's property must go to the head of the house, you kno.

which kind of spceches, in which fashion and the main chanee were
blended together, and after a kiss, which was like the contact of an
oyster-Mrs. Frelerick Bullock would gather her starched nurslings, and
simper baek into her carriage.
Every visit which this leader of fon paid to her family was more unlucky
for her. Her father paid more money into Stumpy and Rowly's. Her
patronage became more and more insufferable. The poor widow in the
little cottage at Brompton, guarding her treasure there, little kew how
eagerly some people coveted it.
A N0VEL WITHOUT A IIER0O.

On that night when Jane Osiorne had told her futher that she had
seen his grandson, the old man had made her no reply: but he had
shown no anges-anl hnd bade her good night on going himself to his
room in rather a kindly voice. And he must have meditated on what she
asaid, and have made some inquiries of the Dobbin fnmily regarding her
visit; for a fortnight nfter it took place, he asked her where was her little
French watch and chuin she used to wenr?
I bought it with my money, Sir,'' she said in a great fright.
Go and order anothcr like it, or a better if you can get it,'' said th
oll gentleman, and lapsed agin into silence.
Of late, the Miss Dobins more than once repeated their entrenalies to
Amelia, to allow deorge to visit them. His nunt had shown her inclina-
tion; perhaps his grandfather himself, they hinted, miglt be disposed to
be reconciled to him. Surely, Amelia cpuld not refuse such nadvantageous
chances for the boy. Nor could she : but she ncceded to their overtures
with s very heavy and suspicious heart, was always uneasy during tho
child's nbsence from her, and welcomed him back as if he was rescued out
of some danger. He brought back money and toys, nt which the widow
looked with alarm and jealousy: she asked him always if he had seen any
gentleman-`` Only old Sir William, who drove him about in the four-
wheeled chaise, nnd Mr. Dobbin, who arrived on the beautiful bay horse in
tho afternoon-in the green coat and pink neck-cloth, with the gold-headed
whip, who promised to show him the Tower of London, and take him out
with the Surrey hounds.'' Mt last, he said  There was an old gentlemnn,
with thick eye-brows and a broad hat, and large chain and seals. He came
one day as tle coachman was lunging Gdeorgy round the lawn on the grey
pony. He looked at mevery much. He shook very much. I said' My
name is Norval' after dinner. My aunt began to cry. She is always
crying.'' Such was George's report on that night.
Then Amelia knew that the boy had seen his grandfather: and looked
ont feverishly for a proposal which she was sure would follow, and which
csme, in faet, in a few days afterwards. Mr. Oshorne formally offered to
take the boy, and make him heir to the fortune which he had intended that
his father shonll inherit. le would make Mrs. George Osborne an
allowance, sucl as to assure hoer a decent competeney. If Mrs., George
Osborne proposed to marry again, as Mr. O, heard was her intention, he
would not withdraw that allowance. But it must be understood, thnt
the child would live entirely with his grandfather in ussell Square, or at
whntever other place Mr. O. should select; and that he would be occasion-
ally permitted to see Mrs. George Osborne at her own residence. This
message was brought or read to her in a letter one day, when her mother
was from home, and her father absent as usual, in the City,
She was never seen angry but twicc or thrice in her life, and it was in
oue of these moods that Mr, Osborne's attorney had the fortune to
behold her. She rose up trembling nnd flushing very much as soon as, after
reading the letter, Mr. Poe handel it to her, and slhe tore the paper into
n hundred fragments, which she trod on. ``I mnrry ngnin l-I take money
to part from my child1 Who dares insult me by proposig such n thing:
Tell Mr. Osborne it is a cowardly letter, Sir-a cowardly letter-I will not

answer it. I wish you good morning, Sir-anl she bowed me out of the
room like a tragedy Gueen,'' said the lawyer who told the story.
Her pnrents never remarked her agitation on that day, and she never
told them of the interview. They had their own affairs to interest them,
affairs which deeply interested this innocent and uneonscious lady. The
old gentleman, her father, was always dabbling in speoulation. We hae
seen how the Wine Company and the Coal Company had failed him. But,
prowling about the City always eagerly and restlessly still, he lighted upon
some other scheme, of which he thought so well that he embarked in it in
spite of the remonstrances of Mr, Clapp, to whom indeed he never dared
to tell how far he had engaged himself in it. And as it was always
Mr. Sedley's maxim not to talk about money mtters before women, they
had no inkling of the misfortunes thut ware in atore for them until the
uuhappy old gentleman was forced to make gradual confessions.
The bills of the little household, which had heen settle weekly, first fell
into arrear. The remittances had not arrived from Inlia, Mr. Sedley told
his wife with a disturbed face. As she had paid her bills ery regularly
hitherto, one or two of the tradesmen to whom the poor lady was obliged
to go round nsking for time were very nngry at a delay, to which they
were perfectly used from more irregular customers. Emmy's contribution,
paid ovcr cheerfully without any questions, kept the little compny in hnlf
rations however. And the first six months passed away pretty easily : old
Sedley still keeping up with the notion that his ashares must rise, and
that ull woull be well.
No sixty pounds, however, came to help the household at the end of
the half year; and it fell deeper and deeper into trouble-Mrs. Sedley,
who was growing infirm nand was much shaken, remained silent or wept a
great deal witl Mrs. Clapp in the kitchen. The butceher was particularly
surly: the grocer insolent-once or twice little Georgy had grumblel
about tho dinners: and Amelia, who still would have been satisfied with a
slice of bread for her own dinner, could not but perceive that her son was
neglected, and purehased little things ont of her private purse to keep the
hoy in heslth.
At last they told her, or told ler such a garbledl story as people in dit6-
culties tell. One day, hcr own money having been received, and Amelian
nbout to pay it over: she who had kept an account of the moneys exrpended
by her, proposed to keep n certain portion back out of her diiidend,
having contracted engagements for a new suit for Georgy.
hen it came out thut Jos's remittances were not paid; that the house
was in difficulties which Amelia ought to hnve seen before, her mother said,
but she cared for nothing or nobody except Georgy. At this she passed all
of her money across thc tnble without a word to her mother, and returned
to her room to cry her eyes out. She had n great access of sensibility too

sell any thing to procure the desired noveltiesP here was her India
shawl that bobbin had scnt her. She remembered in former daye going
with her mother to a fiue India shop on Ludgate Ilill, where the lnadics
had all sorts of denlings and bargains in thcse articles. 1Ier checks
llushcd and her eyes shone with pleasure ns she thought of this resource,
and ahe kissed away eorge to school in the morning, smiling brightly
ufter him. The boy felt there was good news in her look.
Pncking up ler shawl in a handkerchief, (another of the gifts of the good
MIajor,) she hid them under her cloak, and wulked flushed and cager all
the way to Ludgate IIill, tripping along by the Park wall, and running
over thc crossings, so that many a man turned ns she hurriel by him, and
looked after her rosy pretty face. She caleultcd how she should spcnd
the procceds of her shawl: how, bcsides tho clothcs, she would buy thc
books that he longed for, and psy his hall-year's schooling;: and howu slc
would buy a clonk for her father instead of that old great-coat which he
wore. She was not mistaken as to the value of the Mnjor's gift. It was
a vcry fine and benutiful web: and the merchant made a Very good bar-
gain when he gave her twenty guineas for her shawl.
She rn on amazed and flurried with her riches to Darton's shop in St.

the ``Snmndforl and Merton'' Georgy longed for, and got iuto the coach

by writing in the fly-leaf in hcr nentest little hand, ``George Osborne, Y
Christmas gift from his affectionate mother.'' The books are extant to this
day, with the fair delicate superscription.
She was going from her own roo with the books in her hnl to
place them on George's table, where he might find them on his rcturu

And tlen she went into her room, and sank down in despair and utter
uisery. She saw it all now. Her selfishness was sacrificing the boy. But
for her he might have wealth, station, education, and his father's place,
which the elder George had forfeited for her sake. She had but to

Peering over the railings and through the black
trees iuto the garden of the Square, you sce a fe
miserable governesses with wan-faced pupils wan-
dering round and round it, and rounl the dreary
grass-plot in the centre of which rises the stal
of Lord Gaunt, who fought at Minden, in a threte-
tniled wig, and otherwise habited like a Roman
lEmeror. Gaunt Ilouse occupics uenrly a side of
the qunre. he remaining three sides are com-
posed of mansions that lave passed aay inta
Dowageris;-tall, dark houses, with window-
frames of stone, or picked out of a lighter red.
Little light scems to be bchinl those lean, cou-
fortless casements now: nnd hospitality to have
passed away from thosc doors as mucl as th
laced lacqueys nnd link-boys of old times, who used
to put out tleir torches in the blank iron extinguislers that still flank the
lamps uver the steps. Brass platcs have penctrated iuto the Squarc-
Doetors, the bDidllesex bank WVestern Branch-the English and European
Reunion, &e.-it has a lreary look-nor is my Lorl Steyne's paluace less
dreary. All I have eer seen of it is the vast wall in front, with thc rustic
columns at the great gate, through which an old portcr peers sometimes with
a fat and gloomy red face-and over the wall the garret and bed-room
windows, and the chimneys, out of which there seldom comes any smoke
now. For the present ILord Steyne lives at Naples, preferring the view of
the Bay and Cnpri nnl Vesuius, to the dreury aspect of the wall in
Gaunt-square.
A few score of yards down New Gnunt-street, and leading into Gaunt-
mews indeed, is a little modest baek loor, which you would not remark
fromu that of any of the other stables. But many a little elose carriage
has stopped at that door, as my informnnt (little Tom Eaves, who knows

banqucting-room taken from Sallust's house at Pompeii, and paiuted by
Cosway-a little private kitchen, in which every saucepan was silver, and
all the spits were gold. It was there that Egnlite Orleans rosted par-
tridges on the night when he and the Marquis of Steyne won a hundred
thousand from a great personage at Hombre. Half of the money went to
the French Revolution, half to purchaseLord Gaunt's Marquisate and Garter
-and the remainder-'' but it forms no part of our scheme to tell what
became of the remainder, for every shilling of which, and a grent deal more,
little Tom Eaves, who knows everybody's afairs, is ready to aecount.
Besides his town palacee, the Mnrquis had castles and palaccs in arious
quarters of the thrce kingdoms, whereof the descriptions may be found in
the oad-books-Castle Strongbow, with its woods, on the Shannon
shore; Gaunt Castle, in Crmrthenshire, where Richard II. was taken
prisouer-Gauntly Hall in Yorkshire, where I hae been informed thera
were two hundred silver teapots for the breakfasts of the guests of the
house, with everything to correspnd in splendour; and Stillbrook in
IIampshire, which was my lord's farm, a humble place of residence, of
whichi we all remember tle wonderful furniture which was sold at my lord's
demise by a late celebrated auctioneer,
The Marchioness of Steyne was of the renowned and ancient family
of the Caerlyons, Marquises of Camelot, who hae preserved the old faith
ever since the conversion of the venerable Druid, their first anceestor, and
whose peligree goes far beyond the date of the arrivl of King Brute in
thcse islands, Pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house. The
sons have bcen called Arthurs, Uthers, and Caradoes, from immemorial
time. Their heads have fallen in many a loyal conspiraoy. Elizabeth
chopped of the head of the Artlur of her day, who had been Chamberlain
to lhilip and Mary, and carried letters between the Gueen of Scots and
her uncles the Guises. A cndet of the house was an officer of the great
Duke, and distinguished in the famous Saint Bartholomews conspiraey.
During the whole of Mary's confinement, the house of Camelot conspired
in ler behalf. It was as much injured by its charges in ftting out an
armament against the Spaniards, during the time of the Armada, as by the
fines and confiscations levied on it by Elizabeth for harbouring of priests,
obstinate recusaney, and Popish misdoings. A recrennt of James's time
was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of that
great theologian, and the fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his
timely weakness. But the Earl of Camelot, of the reign of Charles,
returnel to the old creel of his family, and they continued to fight for it,
anl ruin themselves for it, as long as there was a Stnart left to head or to
instigate a rebellion.
Lady Mary Caerlyon was brought up at a Prisimn convent, the Dan-
phiness Marie Antoinette was her godmother. In the pride of her beauty
she ad been marriel-sold, it was said-to Lord Gaunt, then at Paris,
who won vust sums from the lady's brother at some of Philip of Orlenns's
banquets. The Earl of Gaunt's famous duel with the Count de ls Marche,

of the Grey Musqueteers, was attributed by common rceport to tlhe preteu-
sions of that ollicer (who had been a pge, aud remained a favouirite of
the ueen) to the hand of the eautiful Lsdy Mlary Cuerlyon. Shc was
married to Lord Gaunt while the Count lay ill of his wounil, and came to
dwell at Gsunt House, anl to figure for a short time in the splendid Court
of the Prince of Wales. Fox hnl toasted her. Morris and Sheridan hnd
written songs about her. MIalmsbry had made her his bcst bow; Wal-
pole had pronouneed her charming; Devonslire had been almost jealous
of her; but she was scared by the wild pleasurcs and gaieties of the society
into which sho was flung, and after she had borne a couplc of sons, shrank
away into a life of devout seclusion. No wonder thnt my Lorl Stcyue,
who liked pleasure and cheerfulness, was not often seen after their marriage,
by the side of tis trembling, silent, superstitious, unhappy laly.
The before-mentioned Tom Eaves, (who has no part in this history,
except that he knew all the great folks in London, and the stories and
mysteries of each family,) had further information regarling my ludy
Sleyne, which may or may not be true.  The humiliations,'' ITom used to
say, `which that woman has been made to undergo, in her own house,
havc been frightful; Lord Steyne has male her sit down to table with
women with whom I would rather die than allow Mrs. Eaves to associate-

in min thnt it is always Tom Eaves who speaks), ``that the Mnrchioness of
tcyne, the haughtiest woman in England, woull bend down to her husband
so submissively, if there were not some cause Poohl I tell you there are
seeret reasons. I tell you, that in the emigration, the Abbe de la MIarce
who was here and was employed in the uiberoon business with Puieaya
and Tinteniac, was the same Colonel of Mousquetaires Gris with whom
Steyne fought in the year '86-that he and the Marchioness met again:
that it was after the Reverend Colonel was shot in Brittany, that Lady
Steyne took to those extreme practices of deotion which she carries on
now : for she is closeted with her director every day-she is at service at
Spanish-place, every morning, I'e watched her there-that is, lI've
happened to be passing thero-and depend on it there's a mystery in her
case. People are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent
of,'' added Tom Eaves with a knowing wag of his head; ``and depend
on it, that woman would not be so submissive as she is, if the Marquis
had not some sword to hold over her,''

how miserable our betters may be, and that Damocles, who sits on satin
cushions, nnd is served on old plate, has an awful sword hanging over his
hcad in the shape of a bailiff, or an hereditary disease, or a family secret,
which peeps out every now and then from the embroidered arrass in a
ghastly manner, and will be sure to drop one da or the other in the
right place.
In comparing, too, the poor man's situation with that of the great, tlerc
is (always according to Mr. Eaves) anotler great source of comfort for
the former. o who have little or no patrimony to bequeath or to
inherit, may be on good terms with your father or your son, whereas the
leir of a great priuce, such as my Lord Steyue, must naturally be angry
nt being kept out of his kingdom, and eye the occupant of it with no ery
agreeable glances. 'Take it as a rule,'' this sardonic old ELaves would
say, `" the fathers and elder sons of all great families hate each other. The
Crown Prince is always in opposition to the crown or hankering after it.
Shukspeare knew the world, my good Sir, and when he deserilies Prince
HIal (from whose fumily the Gaunts pretend to be descended, though thes
are no ore related to John of Gaunt than you are,) trying on his father's
coronet, he gives you a natural description of all heirs-apparent. If you
were heir to a dukcdom and a thousand pounds a day, do you mean to
say you would not wish for possession? Poohl And it stamds to reason
tht every great man, huving experienced this feeliug towards his father,
must be aware that his sou entertains it towards limself; anl so they
can't but be suspicious and hostile.
 Then again, as to the feeliug of elder towards younger sous. MIy
lenr Sir, you ought to kuow that every elder brother looks upon the cadets
of the house as his natural enemies who deprive him of so much rendy
money whicl ought to be his by right. I hae often heard George
Mae Turk, Lord lajazet's eldest son, say thnt if he had his will, when he
came to the title, hc would do what the sultans do, and clear the estate
by chopping off all his younger brothers' heads at once ; and so the cnse
is, more or less, with tlem all. I tell you they are all urks iu their
hearts. Poohl Sir, they know the world.'' And here, haply, a great
nan coming up, Tom Enves's hat would drop off his head, and he would
rush forward with a bow and a grin, which showed that he knew the
world too-in the Tomeuvesiun wny, that is. And having laid out every
shilling of his fortune on an annuity, Tom could afford to bear no malicc
to his nephews and nicces, and to hsve no other feeling with regard to his
betters, but a constant and generous desire to ine with them.
Between the Marchioness nnd the nntural and tender regard of mother
for children, there was that cruel barrier placed of difference of faith. Tha
very love which she might feel for her sons, only served to render the
timid and pious lady nore fearful nnd unhappy. The gulph which sepa-
rated them was fatal aud impassable, She could not stretch her weak
arms across it, or draw her children over to that side away from which
her belief told her there was no safety. During the youth of his sons,

alternately; he promised Mole a bishoprio if he would come over ; and
vowed he would use all his influence to get Trail a cardinal's hat if he
wouldl secede. Neither divine allowed himself to be conquered; and
though the fonl mother hoped that her youngest and favourite son would
be reconciled to her church-his mother church-a sad and awful disap-
pointment awaited the devout lady-a disappointment which seemed to
be a judgment upon her for the sin of her marriage.
My Lord Gaunt married, as every person who frequents the Peerage
knows, the Lady Blanche Thistlewood, a daughter of the noble house of
Bareseres, before mentioned in this veracious history. A wing of Gaunt
House was assigned to this couple; for the head of the family chose
to govern it, and while he reigned to reign supreme : his son and heir,
however, living little at home, disagreeing with his wife, borrowing upen
post-obits such monies as he required beyond the very moderate sums

which his father was disposed to allow him. The marquis knew every
shilling of his son's debts. At his lamented demise, he was found limself
to be possessor of many of his hcir's bonds, purchased for their benetit,
and devised by his lordship to the children of his younger son.
As, to my Lord Gaunt's dismay, and the chuckling delight of his natural
enemy and fuather, the Lady Gaunt had no children-the Lord George
Gaunt was desired to rcturn from Vienna, where he was engaged in waltzing
and diplorcy, and to contraet a mutrimonial allianee with the Honourable
Joan, only daughter of John Johnes, First Baron Helvellyn, and head of
the firm of Jones, Brown, and Robinson, of Threadneedle Street, Bankers;
from which union sprang several sons and daughters, whose doings do
not appertain to this story.
The narriage at first was a happy and prosperous one. My Lord George
Gaunt could not ouly read, but write pretty correctly. He spoke Freneh
with considerable fluency; and was oue of the finest waltzers in lurope.
With these talents, and his interest at home, there was little doubt that his
lordship would rise to the highest dignities in his profession. The lsdy,
his wife, felt that courts were her sphere; and her wealth enabled her to
receive splcndidly in those continental tows whither her husband's diplo-
matie duties led him. There was talk of appointing him minister, and bets
were laid at the Travellers' that he would be ambassador ere long, when
of n sudden, rumours arrived of the secretary's extraordinary behaviour.
At a grand diplomatic dinner given by his chief, he had started up, and
declared that a dtc defoie gras was poisoned. He went to a ball at the
hotel of the Bavarian envoy, the Count de Springbock-Hohenlnufen, with
his head shaved, and dressed as a Capuchin friar. It was not a asked
ball, as some folks wnnted to persuade you. It was souething queer,
people whisperel. IIis granlather was so. It was in the family.
Hlis wife and family returned to this country, and took up their abode
at Gaunt Ilouse. Lord George gave up his post on the European con-
tinent, and was gazetted to brazil. But people knew better; he never
returned from that Brazil expedition-never died there-neer lived there
-=-never was there at all. IIe was nowhere: he was gone out altogether.
Brazil,'' snid one gossip to another, with n grin-'`Brazil is St. Johu's
Wood. Rio Janeiro is a cottage surrounded by four walls; and George
Gaunt is aceredited to n keepcr, who hns invested him with the order of
the Straight Wnistcoat.'' These are tlo kinds of epitaphs which men
pass over one another in Vanity Fair,
Twice or thrice in a week, in the earliest morning, the poor mother went
for her sins and saw the poor invalid. Sometimes he laughed at her, (and his
laughter was more pitiful than to hear him cry); sometimes she found the
brilliant dandy diplomatist of the Congress of Vienna dragging about a
child's toy, or nursing the keeper's baby's doll. Sometimes he knew her
and Father Mole, her direetor and companion : oftener he forgot her, ns
he had done wife, children, love, ambition, vanity. But he remembered
his dinner-hour, and used to cry if his wine-and-water wss not strong
enough.
It was the mysterious taint of tle blood : the poor mother had brought
it from hcr own ancient race. The evil had broken out once or twice in

of the race was struck down as the firstborn of Pharaoh. The dark mark
of fate and doom was on the threshold,-the tall old threshold surmounted
by coronets and carved heraldry.

living dead man was less frequently in their mouths-then not mentioned
at all. But the stricken old grandmother trembled to think that these
too were the inheritors of their father's shame as well as of his honours:
and watched sickening for the day when the awful ancestral curse should
come down on them.
This darkc presentiment also haunted Lord Steyne. He tried to lay the
horrid bed-side ghost in Rel Seas of wine and jollity, and lost sight of it

baek to him when alone, and seemed to grow more threatening with years.
I have taken your son,'' it said, '` why not you I may slut you up in
a prison some dlsy like your son George. I may tap you on the head to-
morrow, and away go pleasure and honours, feasts and beauty, friends,
flatterers, French cooks, fine horses and houses-in exchange for a prison,
n keeper, and a straw mattrass like George Gaunt's.'' And then my lord
would defy the ghost which threatened him : for he knew of a remedy by
which he could baulk his enemy.
So there was splendour and wealth, but no great happiness percbance
bchind the tall csrved portals of Gaunt House with its smoky coronets
and ciphers. The feasts there were of the grandest in London, but there
was not over-much content therewith, except among the guests who sate
aut my lord's table. IIad he not been so great a Prince very few possibly
wouId have visited him: but in Vanity Fair the sin of very great
personnges arce looked at indulgently. ``Nous reardons a de fois'' (as the
French lady said) before we condemn a person of my lord's unloubted
quality. ome notorious carpers and squeamish moralists might be sulky
with Lord Steyne, but they were glad enough to come when hc asked
them.
'Lord Steyne is really too bad,'' Lndy Slingstone said, '`but cveryboly
goes, and of course I shall see that my girls come to no harm.'' : His
lordship is a man to whom I owe much, everything in life,'' said the
Right Reverend Doetor Trail, thiuking that the Archbishop was rather
sbaky ; and MIrs. Trail and the young ladies would as soon have missed
going to church as to one of his lordship's prties. ` His morals are
bad,'' said little Lorl Southdown to his sister, who meekly exspostulated,
having heard terrific legends from her mamma with rcspect to the doings
at Gaunt House; `' but hang it, he 's got the best dry Sillery in Europe 1''
And as for Sir itt Crawley, Bart,-Sir Pitt that pattern of deeorum, Sir
Pitt who had led off at missionary meetings,-he neer for one moment
thought of not goiug too.  Where you see such pcrsons as the Bishop of
Ealing nd the Countess of Slingstone, you may be pretty sure, Jane,''
the Baronet would say, '` that e cannot he wrong. The great rank and
station of Lord Steyne put him in a position to command people in our
station in life. Thce Lord Lieutenant of a County, my deur, is arespectable
man. Besides George Gaunt and I were intimate in carly life: he was
my junior when we wcre attachds at Pumpernickel togcther,''

Tlast Becky's kinness and attention to
the clief of her husband's family, wvere
destined to meet with an exceeding
great rewarl; a reward which, though
certainly somewhat unsubstantial, the
little woman coveted with grealer
eagerness than more positive benefits.
If she did not wish to lend n virtuous
life, at least sle desired to enjoy a
character for virtue, and we know
that no lady in the genteel world
can possess this desileratum, untilshe
has put on a train aud feathers, and
has bcen presented to her Sovereign
at Court. From that august inter-
view they come out stamped ns honest
women. The Lord Chamberlain gives
them a certificale of virtue. And as
dubhious goods or letters are passed
through an oven at quarantine, sprin-
kled with nromatic vinegar, and then
pronounced clean-many a lady
whose reputation would be doubtful
otherwise and liable to give infection,
passes through the wholesome ordeal
of the Royal presence, and issues from it free from all taint.
It might be very well for my Lady Bareaeres, my Laly Tufto, Mrs. Bute
Crawley in the country, and other lndies who had come into contact with
MIrs. Rawdon Crawley, to ery fie at the idea of the odious little adventuress
making her curtsey before the Sovereign, and to declare, that if dear good
ueen Charlotte hnd been alive, ale neer would have admitted such an
extremely ill-regulated personasge into Her chaste drawing-room. But
when we consider, that it was the FirstGentleman in Europe in whose high
presence Mrs. Rawdon passed her examination, and as it were, took her
legree in reputation, it surely must be flat disloyalty to doubt any more
about her virtue. I, for my part, look back with love and awe to that
Grent Charaeter in history. Ah, what a high anl noble appreciation of
Gentlemanhood there ust have been in Vanity Fair, when that revered
and august being was investel, by the universal aeclaim of the refined and
educated portion of this empire, with the title of Premier Gentilhomme of

(Lord of the Powder Closet,) and other great olhicers of state were behind
the chair on which he sate, lle sate-florid of face, portly of persou,
covered with orders, and in a rich curling head of hair-lIow we sang
God save him. 1Iow the house rocked and shouted with that agnificent
music. IIow they cheered, and cricd, nnd wnved handkerchiefs. Ladies
wept : mothers clasped their children : somue fainted with emotion. People
were suffocated in the pit, shrieks and groans rising up amidst tle writhing

-be it our reasonuble boast to our children, that we saw George the Good,
the Magnificent, the Great.
Well, there cae a happy day in MIrs. Rawdon Crawley's existence wlen
this angel was admitted iuto tle pnradise of n Court which she coveted:
her sister-in-law aeting as her god-other. On the appointed day, Sir Pitt
and his lady in their great family carriage (just newly built, and ready for
the baronets nssumption of the ofice of Higl Sheriff of his county) drove
up to the little house in Curzon Street, to the edifieation of Raggles wlo
was watching from his green-grocer's shop, and sw fine plumes within, and
enormous bunches of flowers in the breasts of tle ncw livery-coats ol the
footmen.
Sir Pitt, in a glittering uniform, lescendel and went into Curzon Strcet,
lis sword between his legs. Little Rawdon stool with his faxe against
tle parlour window panes, smiling and nodding with all his might to his
aunt in tle carriage within; and presently Sir Pitt issued forth from the
house agaiu, lcading forth a lady with graud feathers, covered in a white
shawl, and loldiug up daintily a train of magnifieent brocade. She stepped
into the vehicle as if she were a princess and accustomed all her life to go
to Court, asmiling graciously on the footman at the door, and on Sir Pitt,
who followed hcr iuto the carriage.
Then awdon followed iu his old Guards' uniform, which had grown
wofully shabby, nd was much too tight. He was to have followed the
proeession, and waited upon his sovereign in a cab; but that his good-
natured sister-in-law insisted that they should be a family party. The
coaeh was large, the ladies not very big, they would hold their trains in
their laps-finally, the four went fraternally together; and their carriage
presently joined the line of loyal equipages which ws making its way
down liecadilly and St. James's Street, towards the old brick palace, whcre
the Star of Bruuswick was in waitig to receive his nobles and gentlefolks.

position which she had at last attained in life. Een our Becky had her
wenknesses, and as one often sees how men pride themseles upon excel-
lencies which others are slow to perceive: how, for instance, Comus firmly
believes that he is the greatest tragic asctor in England; how Brown, the
famous novelist, longs to be considered, not a man of genius, but a man
of fashion; while Robinson, the great lawyer, does not in the least care
about his reputation in Westminster all, but believes himself incom-
parable aeross country, and at a five-barred gate-eo, to be, and to be
tlought, a respectable woman was Becky's aim in life, and she got up the
genteel with anazing assiduity, readiness, and success. We have said,
there were times when she believed herself to be a fine lady, and forgot
that there was no money in the chest at lome-duns round the gate,
tradesmen to coax nnd wheedle-no ground to walk upon, in a word.
And as she went to court in the carriage, the family carriage, she adopted
a demeanour so grand, self-atisfied, deliberate, and imposing, that it made
even Lady Jane laugh. She walked into the royal apartments with a toss
of the head which would have befitted an empress, and I have no doubt
had she been one, she would have become the character nerfectly.
We are authorised to state that Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's coste de conr
on tle occasion of her presentation to the Sovereign wns of the most
elegnnt and brilliant description. Some ladies we may have seen, we,
who wear stars and cordons, and attend the St. James's assemblies, or we,
who, in muddy boots, dawdle up and down Tall Mall, and peep into the
conaches as they drive up with the great folks in their feathers-somne
ladies of fashion, I say, we may have seen, about two o'clock of the fore-
noon of a levee day, ns the laced-jacketed bnd of the Life Guards are
blowing triumphasl marches seated on those praneing music-stools, their
cream-coloured chargers-who are by no means loely and enticing objects
at that early period of noon. A stout countess of sixty, decolletee, pninted,
wrinkled, with rouge up to her drooping cyelids, and diamonds twinkling
in her wig, is n wholesome anud edifying, but not na pleasnt sight. She
has the faded look of a St. James's Street illumination, as it may be seen
of an early morning, when half the lamps are out, and the otlers are
bliuking wanly, as if they were about to vnnish like ghosts before the
dawn. Such charms, as those of whieh we catch glimpses while her
ladyship's carriage passea, should appear abroad at night alone. If even
Cynthia looks haggard of an afternoon as we may asce her sometimes in the
present winter season, with Plebus staring her out of countenance from
the opposite side of the heavens, how much more can old Indy Castle-
mouldy keep her head up when the sun is shining full upon it through thc
chnriot windows, and showing all the chinks and crannies with which
time has marked her faceP No. Drawing-rooms ehould be announced
for November, or the first foggy day: or the elderly sultanas of our
Vanity Fair should drive up in closed litters, descend in a covered way,
and make their curtsey to the Soereign under the protection of lamplight.
Our beloved Rebecca had no need, however, of any such n friendly
hulo to set off her beauty. Her complexion could bear any sunshine ns
yet; and her dress, thongh if you were to sce it now, any present lady of
Vanity Fair would pronounce it to be the most foolish and preposterous

YANITY AIB.
attire eer worn, was as hndsome in her eyes and those of the public,
some five-and-tweuty years since, as the most brilliant costume of tle most
famous beauty of the present season. A score of years hence that, too,
that milliner's wonder, will have passed into the domain of the absurd,
along with all previous vanities. But we are wandering too much. Mrs.
Rawdon's dress was pronounced to be charmate on the ecentful day of her
presentation. Even goot little Lady Jane was forced to acknowledge
this effect, as she looked at her kinswoman; and owned sorrowfully to
herself that she was quite iuferior in taste to Mrs. Becky.
She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Rawdon
had bestowed upon that garment. Rehecca had as good teste ns any
millincr in Europe, and such a clever way of doing tlings as Lady Jane
little undcrstood. The latter quickly spied out the msgnificeuce of the
brocade of Becky's train, and the splendour of the lace on her dresa.
The broceale was an old remnant, Becky said; and as for the lace, it
was a great bargaiu. She had had it these hundrel years.
My dcar Mrs. Crawley, it must have cost a little fortune,'' Lady Jane
sail, looking down at her own lace, which was not nearly so good; and
then esnmining the quality of the ancient brocade, which formed the
material of Mrs. Rawdon's court drese, she fclt inclined to sy that she
could not nfforl such fine clothing, but checked that speech, with an effort,
as one uncharitable to her kinswoman.
And yet if Lady Jane hal known all, l think even her kindly temper
would have failed her. The fact is, when she was putting Sir Pitt's house
in order, Mrs. Rawdon had found the lace and the brocade in old ward-
robes, the property of the former ladies of the ouse, and had quietly
carried the goods home, and had suited them to her own little person.
Briggs saw her take them, asked no questions, told no stories; but I
believe quite sympathised with her on this matter, and so would many
another honest woman.
And the diamonds- Where the doose did you get the liamonds,
Becky'' said her husband, admiring some jewels which he hal never seen
before, and which sparkled in her ears and on her neck with brilliancs
and profusion.
Becky blushed a little, and looked at him harl for a moment. Pitt
Crawley blushed a little too, and looked out of window. The fact is, he
had given her a very small portion of the brilliants; a pretty diamond
clasp, which confined a pearl necklace which she wore; and the lBaronet
had omitted to mention the circumstance to his lady.
Becky looked at her husband, anl then at Sir Pitt, with an air of saucy
triumph-as much as to say, ``Shall I betray you''
``Gueas.'' she sid to her husband.  Why, you silly man,'' ahe
continued, '` where do you suppose I got them-all except the little clssp,
which a dear friend of mine guve me long age. I hired tlem, to be sure.
I hired them at Mr. Poloniis's, in Coventry-street. Iou don't suppose
that ull the diamonds which go to court belong to the owners; like those
beautiful stones which Lady Jane has, and which are much handeomer
than any which I hae, I am certain.''
They are family jcwels,'' said Sir Pitt, agsin looking uneasy. And

in this family conversation the carriage rolled down the street, until its
cargo was tinally disclarged at the gates of the palace where tle Sovereign
was sitting in state.
The diamonds, which had created Rawdon's admiration, never went back
to Mr. Polonius, of Coventry-street, and that gentleman never applied for
thcir restoration ; but they retired into a little private rpository, in an
old desk, which Amelia Sedley had given her years and years ago, and in
which Bccky kept a numler of useful and, perhaps, valuable thiugs, about
whieh her husbnd knew nothing. To know nothing, or little, is in the
nature of some husbands. To hide, in the nature of how many women 
O ladiesl how many of you have surreptitious milliners' bills? Iow
any of you have gowns and bracelets, which you duren't show, or which
you wear trembling -trembling, and coaxing with smiles the husband by
your side, who does not know the ncw velset gown from the old one, or
the new bracelet from lust year's,or has any notion that the ragged-
looking yellow lace scurf cost forty guineas, and that Mudame Bobinot is
writing duing letters every week for the money l
Thus Ruwdon knew nothing about the brilliant diamond ear-rings, or the
superb brilliant ornament which decorated the fuir bosom of lis lady;
bt Lord Steyne, who was in his place at court, as Lord of the Powder
Closet, and one of the great dignitaries and illustrious defences of the
throne of England, and came up witl all his stars, garters, collars, anl
cordons, and paid particular attention to the little woman, knew whence the
jewels came, and who paidl for them.
As he bowed over her he smiled, and quoted the hnckneyel and benutiful
lines, from the Rape of the Lock, about Belinda's diamonds, ``wvhicl Jews
might kiss and infidels alore.''
 But I hope your lordship is orthodox,'' said the little lady, with a
toss of her head. And many ladies round about whispered nnd talked,
and many gentlemen noled and wlispered, as they saw what mcrked
attention the great nobleman was paying to the little adventuress.
What were the circumstances of the interview between Rebccca Crawley,
ne Sharp, nd her Imperial MIaster, it does not become such a feeble and
inexperienced pen as mine to attempt to relate. The dazzlcd eyes close
before that Magnificent Ides. Loyal respeet and decency tell even tle
imagination not to look too keenly and audaciously about the sacred
nudience-chamber, but to back away rapidly, silently, and respectfully,
making profound bows out of the August Presence.
This may be said, that in all London thcre was no more loyal leart than
Becky's after this interview. The name of her king was always on hcr
lips, and he was proclaimel by her to be the most clarming of men. She
went to Colnaghi's and ordered the finest portrait of him that art had

the best of monarchs is represented in a frock-coat with a fur collar, nnd
breeches and silk stockings, simpering on a sofa from under lis curly
brown wig. She had him painted in a brooch and wore it-indeed she

about his urbnnity and beauty. Who knowsf Perhaps the little woman
thought she might play the part of a Maintenon or a Pompadour.

VNIFY AIR.
But the finest sport of all after her presentation was to hear her talk
virtuously. She had a few female aequaiutanees, not, it must be owned,
of the very highest reputation in Yanity Fair. But being made an honest
woman of, so to speak, Becky would not eonsort any longer with these
dubious ones, and cut Lady Crackenbury, when the ltter nodded to her
from her opera-box; and gave Mrs. Washington White the go-by in ths
Ring. '`One must, my dear, show one is somebody ;'' she said.  One
musn't be seen with doubtful people. I pity Lady Crackenbury from my
heart; and Mrs. Washington White masy be a very good-natured person.
Io may go and dine with them, as you like your rubber. But I mustn't,
and won't; and you will hae the goodness to tell Smith to say I am not
at home when either of them calls,''
The particulars of Becky's costume were in the newspapers-feathers,
lappets, superb diamonds, and all the rest. Mrs. Crackenbury read the
peragraph in bitterness of spirit, and diseoursed to her followers about the
airs which that woman was giving herself. Mrs. Bute Crawley and her
young ladies in the country had a copy of the Momning Post from town;
nnd gae a vent to their honest indignation.  If you had been sandy-
haired, green-eyed, and a French rope-dancer's daughter,'' MIrs. Bute said
to her eldest girl (who, on the contrary, was a very swarthy, short, and
snub-nosed young lady), `` you might have had superb diamonds forsooth,
and have been presented at court, by your consin, the Lady Jane. But
you 're only a gentlewoman, my poor dear child. ou have only some of
tle best blood in lngland in your veins, and good principles and piety for
your portion. I, myself, the wife of a Baronet's younger brother, too,
neer thought of such a thing as going to court-nor woud other people,
if good (ueen Charlotte had bcen alie.'' In this way the worthy Rectoress
consoled herself; and her daughters sighed, and sate oer the Peerage all
night.
A few dys after the famous presentation, another great nnd exceeding
honour was vouchsafed to the virtuous Becky, Lady teyue's carriage
lrove np to Mr. Rawdon Crnwley's door, and the footman, instead of
driving down the front of the house, as by his tremendous knocking he
appeared to be inclined to do, relented, anl only delivered in a cople of
cards, on which were engraven the names of the Marchioness of Steyne
and the Countess of Gaunt. If these bits of pasteboard had been beau-
tiful pictures, or hnd had a hundred yards of Malines lace rolled round
them, worth twice the number of guineas, Becky could not have regarded
them with more pleasure. Yon may be sure they occupied a conspicuous
place in the china bowl on the drawing-room table, where Becky
kept the cards of her visitors. Lordl lordl how poor Mrs. Washington
White's card and Lndy Crackenbury's card, which our little friend had
been glad enough to get a few months back, and of which the silly little
creature was rather proud once-Lordl lordl I say, how soon at the
appearance of these grand court cards, did those poor little neglected

and Briggs looked out those august names in the Peerage, and followed
the noble rces up through all the ramifications of the family tree.
My Lord Steyne coming to call a couple of hours afterwards, nand looking
about him, and observing everything as was his wont, found his lady's cards
already ranged as the trumps of lBecky's hand, and grinned, as this old cynic
always did at any naive display of humnn weakness. Becky came down
to him presently: whenever the dear girl expeeted his lordship, her
toilette was prepared, her hair in perfeet order, her mouchoirs, aprons,
scarfs, little morocco alippers, and other female gimcracks arranged, and
she seated in some artless and agreeable posture ready to receive him-
whenever she was surprised, of course, she had to fly to her apartment to
take n rapid survey of matters in the glass, and to trip down again to
wait upon the great peer.
She found him grinning over the bowl. She was diseovered, anl she
blushed a little.  Thank you, Monseigneur,'' she said.  You see your
ladies have been here. How good of you? I couldn't come before-I
wass in the kitchen making a pulding.''
 I know you were, I saw you through the area-railings as I drove up,''
replied the old gentleman.
You see everything,'' she replied.
A ew things, but not tht, my pretty lady,'' he said good-naturelly.
eou silly little fibsterl I heard you in the room over head, where I have
no doubt you were putting a little rougo on; you must give some of
yours to my Lady Gaunt, whose complexion is quite preposterous; and I
heard the bed-room door open, and then you came down stairs,''
tIs it n erime to try and look my best when you come here?'' nanwered
Mra. Rawdon plaintively, and she ruhbed her cheek with her handkerchief
ns if to show there was no rouge at all, only genuine blushes and modesty
in her case. Abount this who can tollP I know there is some rouge
that won't come off on a pocket-handkerchief ; and some so good that
even tears will not disturb it.
 Well,'' aaid the old gentleman, twiddling round his wife's card, ``you
are bent upon becoming a fiue lady. ou pester my poor old life out to
get you into the world. ou won't be nble to hold your own there, you
silly little fool. ou 've got no money.''
e You will get us a place,'' interposed Becky, as quick as possible.
 Yon've got no money, and you want to compete with those who

stream along with the great copper kettles. All women are alike. very-

aur femes, look out and hold your ownl How the women will bully you'l''
This was a vcry long spcech for a man of few words like my Lord Steyne;
nor wns it the first which he had uttered for Becky's benefit on that day.
Briggs looked up from the work-table at which she was seted in the
further room, and gave a deep sigh as she heard the great Marquis speak
so lightly of her sex.
If' you don't turu off tht abominable-sheep dog,'' said Lord
Stcyne, with a savage look oer lis shoulder at her, `I will hnse her
poisoned,''
I always give my dog dinner from my own plate,'' said Rebece,
laughing mischievously; and having enjoyed for some time the discomfi-
ture of y lord, who hatedl poor riggs for interrupting his tete-i-ttte
with the fair Colonel's wife, Mrs. Rawdon at length had pity upon he
admirer, and calling to lriggs, praised the fineness of the weather to her,
and bade her to take out the chill for a walk.
``I can't send her away,'' Becky said presently, after a pause, and in a
very sad voice. Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke, and she turned
away her head.
You owe icr hcr agesf I suppose,'' sail the Peer.
Worse than that,'' snid Beeky, still casting down her eyes, " I hae
ruinel her.''
 Ruined her 3-then why don't you turmn her out '' the gentleman
asked.
Men dlo that,'' Becky answered bitterly.  Women are not so bad
as you. Lust yenr when we were reduced to our last guinea, she gave us
cvery thing. Shce shall never leave me, until we are ruined utterly our-
selves, which does not seem far of, or until I can pay her the uttermost
farthing.''
:- it, how much is it?'' said the Peer with an oath. And Becky,
reflecting on the largeness of his mcans, mentioned not only the sum
wlich she had orrowed from MIiss Briggs, but one of nearly double the
amount.
This caused the Lord Steyne to break out in another brief and ener-
getic espression of anger, at which Rebecea held down her head the more,
and eried bitterly. ``I could not help it. It was my only chance. I dare
not tell my husband. HIe would kill me if I told him what I have
done. I have kept it a seeret from cvery body but you-and you forced
it from e. Ah, what shall I do, Lord Steyne? for I amn very, very
unhappy ?''
Lorl Stleyne made no reply except by beating the deil's tattoo, and
biting his nails. At last he clapt his hat on his head, and flung out of
the room. Rebeccn did not rise from her attitulde of misery until the door
slammed unon him, and his carriage whirled away. Then she rose up with
the queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in her green eyes.
She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as she sate at work; and
sitting down to the piano, she rattled away a triumpbant voluntary on
the keys, which made the people pause under her window to listen to her
brilliant music.

A NOYEL WITHOUT A IIE0.
433
That night, there camue two notes from Gaunt House for the little
woman, the one containing a card of invitation from Lord and Lady
Steyne to a dinner nt Gaunt House next Friday: while the other enclosed
a slip of gray paper bearing Lord teyne's signature and the addres of
Messrs. Jones, Brown, and Robinson, Lomhard Street.
Rawdon heard ecky laughing in the night once or twice. It was
only her delight at going to Gaunt House and facing the ladies there,
she said, which amused herso. But the truth was, that she was ocecupied
with a great number of other thoughts. Should she pay off old Briggs
and gie ler her cong6f Should she astonish Baggles by settling his
aocount? She turned over all these thoughts on her pillow, and on the
next day, when Rawdon went out to pay his morning visit to the Club,
Mrs. Crawley (in a modest dress with ai veil on) whipped off in a hackney-
eonch to the City: and being landed at Messr. Jones and Robinson's
bank, presented a document there to the anthority at the desk, who, in
reply, asked her `` How she would take it P''
She gently said ``she would take a hundred and fifty pounds in small
notes aud the remainder in one notec:'' nnd passing through St. Paul's
Curch ard stopped there and bought the hanusomest black silk own
for Briggs wvhich oncy could buy; and which, with a kiss and the
kindest speeches, she presented to the simple old spinster.
Then she walked to Mr. Raggles, inquired nbout his clildren affection-
ately, and gavse him tifty pounds on account. Then she went to the
livery-man irom whom sle jobbed her carriages and gratlified him witha
similar sum. `' And I hope this will be a lesson to you, Spavin,'' she
said, `` and that on the next draving-room d my brother, Sir Pitt,
will not be inconvenienteed by bcing oliged to take four of us in his
carriage to wait upon His Mjesty, beeuse my on carriage is not forthi-
coming.'' It appears there had bcen a dillerefee on the last drawing-
room day. HIence the degtdation which the Colonel had ahmost suftered,
of being obliged to enter the presence of his Sovecreign in a hack caub.
These arrangementa concludel, RBecky paid n visit up-stairs to the
before-mentioned desk, which Amelia Sedley lad given her years and
yers ago, and wlich contatned a number of useful and vnluable littlc
things: in which priate museumi she placeed the one note which Messrs.
Jones and RBobiuson's cushier had given ler.

F
HEN the ladies of Gaunt House
were at breakfast that morning,
Lord Steyne (who took his choco-
late in private, and seldom dis-
turbed the females of his house-
hold, or saw them exeept upon
public days, or wvhen they crossed
cach other in the hall, or when
from his pit-box at the Opera he
surveyed them in their box ou
the grand tier)-His lordslip, we
sey, appeared among the ladies
and the children who were assem-
bled over the tea and toast, and
n battle royal ensued apropos ol
Rebecca.
 My Lndy Steyne,'' he said,
 I want to see tle list for your
dinner on Friday; and I want
you, if you please, to nrite a card
for Colonel and Mrs. Crawley.''
 Blancle writes them,'' Lndy
Stcyhe said in a flutter. `Lady
Gnunt writes them.''
 I will not write to that person,'' Lady Gant anid, a tall nd statels
lady, who looked up for nn instant and then down again after she had
spoken. It was not good to meet Lord Steync's ceyes for those who had
offended him.
 Send the clildren out of the room. Go.'' snid he, pulling at the
bell-rope. The urchins, always frightened before him, retired : their mother
would have followed too.  Not you,'' he sid.  You stop.''
My Lady Steyne,'' he said, `' once more will you have the goodneses
to go to the desk, and write that card for your dinner on Friday ''
My Lord, I will not be present at it,'' Lady Gaunt sail;  I will go
home.''
I wish yon would, and stay there. You will find the bailiffs at Bare-
acres very pleasant company, and I shall be freed from lending money to
your relations, and from your own damned tragedy airs. Who are you to

you; and George's wife is the ouly person in the family who doesn't wish
you were lead. Gaunt would marry again if you were.''
I wish I were,'' her Lnadyship answered, with tears and rage in her
eyes.
You, forsooth, must give yourself airs of virtue; while my wife, who is
an immaculate saint, as everybody knows, and never did wrong in her life,
has no objeetion to meet my young friend, Mrs. Crawley. My Lady
Steyne knows that appearances are sometimes against the bcst of women;
that lies nre often told about the most innocent of them. Pray, Madam,
shall I tell you some little anecdotes about my Lady Bareaeres, your
mamma P''
You masy strike me if you like, Sir, or hit any eruel blow,'' Lady
Gaunt said. To see his wife and daughter sufering always put his Lord-
ship into a good humour.
 My sweet Blanche,'' he asaid, `:'I am a gentleman, and never lay
ny hand upon a woman, sare in the way of kinness. I only wish to
correct little faults in your character. You women are too proud, anl
sadly lack humility, as Father Mole, I'm sure, would tell my Lady
Steynce if he were here. You mustn't give yourselves airs: you must be
meek and humble, my blessings. For all Lady Steyne knows, this cnlum-
niated, simple, good-humourel Mrs. Crawley, is quite innocent-ecn
more innocent than herself. Her husband's charaeter is not good, but it
is as good as Bareaeres', who has played a little and not payed a great deul,
who cheated you out of the only legacy you ever had, and left you a
pauper on my hnds. And Mrs. Crwley is not very well born; but she
is not worse thnn Fnnny's illustrious ancestor, the first de la Jones,''
The money which I brought into the family, Sir,'' Lady George
cried out-
on purchased n contingent reversion with it,'' the Marquis said,
darkly. t If Gaunt dies, your husband may come to his honours; your
littlc boys may inherit them, and who knows what besidesf In the
meanwhile, ladies, be as proud and virtuous as you like abroad, but don't
give me any airs. As for Mrs. Crawley's character, I shan't demean
myself, or that most spotless and perfectly irreprochable lady, by cven
hinting that it requires a defence. You will be pleased to receive her
with the utmost cordiality, as you will receive all persons whom I present
in this honse. This house'' He broke out with a laugh. :Who is thte
master of it nnd what is it This Temple of Virtue bUelongs to me.
And if I invite all Negate or all Bedlam here, by - tly shall be
welcome,''
After this vigorous allocution, to one of which sort Lord Stcyne treated
his ``MIareem,'' whenever symptoms of insubordination nappearel in his
household, the crest-fallen women had nothing for it but to obey. Lady
Gaunt wrote the invitation which his Lordship required, and she and her
mother-in-law drove in person, and with bitter and humilited hearts, to
leave the eards on Mrs. Rawdon, the reception of which causcl that
innocent woman so much pleasure.
There were families in London who would have saerificed a year's
income to receie such an honour nt the hands of those great ladies.

vMTFY FAIR.
Mr. Frederick Bulloek, for iutance, would have gone on her knees from
Mayfair to Lombard Street, if Lsdy Steyue and Lady Gaunt had been
waiting in the City to raise her up, and soy,``Come to us next Friday,''
-not to one of the great crushes, and grand balls of Gannt Honse,
whither everybody went, but to the sacred, unapproachable, mysterious,
delicious entertainments, to be admitted to one of which was a priilege,
mnd an honour, and a blessing indeed.
Severe, spotless, and beautiful, Lady Gaunt held the very highest rank
in Vnnity Fnir. The distinguished oourtesy with which Lord Steyne
treated her, charmed everybody who witessed his behaviour, caused the
severest critics to admit how perfect a gentleman he was, and to own
that his Lordship's heart at least was in the right place.
The Ladies of Gaunt House called Laly Bareacrcs into their aid, in
order to repulse the common enemy. One of Lady Gaunt's carriages
went to IIill Street for hcr Ladyslip's mother, all whose equipages were
in the hands of the bailiffs, whose very jewels and wardrohe, it was ssid,
had been seized by those inexorable Israelites. Bareacres Castle was
theirs, too, with all its costly pictures, furniture, and articles of erti-the
magnificent Vandykes; the noble Reynolds' pictures; the Lawrence por-
traits, tawdry and beautiful, and, thirty years ago, deemed as precious as
works of real genius; the matchless Dancing Nymph of Canova, for which
Lady Bareacres had snte in her youth-Lady lareacres splendid then, and
radinnt in wealth, rank, and beauty-a toothless, bald, old woman now-
n mere rag of a former robe of state. Her Lord, painted at the same
time by Lnwrence, as waving his aabre in front of Bareacres Castle, and
clothed in his uniform of Colonel of the Thiatlewood eomanry, was a
witherel, old, lean man in a great cout and a bBrutus wig: slinking about
Gray's Inn of mornings chietly, and diuing alone at clubs. He did not
like to dine with Steyne now. They had run races of plesurc together
in youth when Bnrencres was the winner. But Steyne hal more bottom
than he, and had lasted him out. he MIarquis was ten times a greater
man now than the young Lord Gaunt of'85; and Bareacres nowhere in
the race-old, beaten, bankrupt, and broken down. He had horrowed
too much money of 3teyne to find it pleassant to meet his old comrade
often. The latter, whenever he wished to be merry, usedl jeeringly to
ask ILndy Gaunt, why her father had not come to see her : He has
not bcen here for four months,'' Lord Steyne would say. ``I cnn always
tell by my cheque-book nfterwards, when I get a isit from Barescres.
What a comfort it is, my Lndies, I bank with one of my sons' fathers-in-laws,
and thc other banks withi mei'
Of the other illustrious persons whom Becky had the honour to
encounter on this her first presentation to the grand world, it does not
become the present historian to say much. There was his Exeelleney the
Prinee of Peterwsaradin, with his Princess; a nobleman tightly girthed,
with a large military chest, on which the laee of his orler ehone magni-
ficently, and wearing the red collar of the Golden Fleese round his neck.
He was the owner of countless flocks. `` Laook at his face. I think he
must be descended from a sheep,'' IBecky whispered to Lord Steyne.
1 NOYEL WITOUT A IIERO.
437
Indeed, his Excellency's countenanee, long, solemn, and white, with the
ornament round his neck, bore some resemblance to that of a venerable
bell-wether.
There was Mr. John Pul Jefferson Jones, titularly attached to the
American Embassy, and correspondent of the New York Demagogue;
who, by way of muking himself agrceable to tle company, asked Lady
Steyne, during a pause in the econversation at dinner, how his dear friend,
George Gaunt, liked the Brazils -lIe and George had been most intimate
at Naples, and had gone up Vesuvius together, Mr. Jones wrote a full and
particular aecount of the dinner, which appeuared duly in the bDemagogue.
He mentioned the nmmes and titles of all the guests, giving biographical
sketches of the principal people. lIe describcl the persons of the ladies
with great eloquence; the service of the table: the size and costume of
the servants: enumerated the dishes and wines served: the ornaments of the
side-board, and the probuble value of the plate. Such a dinner he calculated
could not e disled up under tifteen or eighteen dollars per head. Mnd
he was in the habit, until very lately, of sending over protee, with letters
of recommendation to the present Marquis of iiteyne, ecoureged to do
so by the intimate terms on which le had lived with his dear friend,
the late lord. lIe was most indignant that a young and insiguificant
aristocrat, the Earl of southdown, should have taken the pas of him in theis
proeession to the dining room. ``Just as lI was stepping up to offer my
hand to a very pleasing and witty fashionablc, the brilliant and cxclu-
sive Mrs. Rawdon Crawley''-he wrote-'`the young patrician inter-
osed between me and the lady, nnd whisked my lelen off without a
word of apology. I was fuain to bring up the rcar with the Colonel, the
lady's husband, a stout red-faced warrior who distinguished himself at
Wuterloo, where he had better luck than bcfel some of his brother red-
coals at New Orleans,''
The Colonel's countenance on coming into this polite society wore ae
many blushes as the face of a boy of sixteen assumes when he is con-
fronted with his sister's schoolfellows. It has been told before that
honest Rawdan hal not been much used at any period of his life to ladies'
company. With the men at the Club or the Mess-room, he was well
enough; and could rile, bet, smoke, or play at billiards with the boldest of
them. IIe had had his time for female friendships too: but tht was
twenty years ago, and the ladies were of the rauk of those with whom
Young Marlow in the comedy is represented as having been familiar
before he became abashed in the presence of Miss Harlenstle. The times
are such that one scarcely dares to allude to thuat kind of company which
thousands of our young men in Vanity Fair are frequenting every day,
which nightly fills casinos and dancing-rooms, which is known to exist as
well as the Ring in Hyde Park or the Congregation at St. James's-but
which the most squeamish if not the most moral of societies is letermined
to ignore. In a word, although Colonel Crawley was uow five-and-forty
years of age, it had not been his lot in life to meet with a haulf dozen good
wvomen, bcsides his paragon of n wife. All except her and his kind sister
Lndy Jane, whose gentlo nature had tnmed and won him, scared the

YNIT FAIR.
worthy Colonel: and on oceasion of his first dinner at Gaunt House
he was not heard to make a single remark except to state that the weather
was ery hot. Indeed Becky would have left him at home, but that
virtue ordained that her husband should be by her side to protect the
timid nnd fluttering little creature on her first appearuce in polite
society.
On her first appearance Lord Steyne stepped forward, taking her hand,
and greeting er with great courtesy, and presenting her to Lady Steyne
and their ladyships, her daughters. Their ladyships made three stately
curtsies, and the elder lady to be sure gave her hand to the new comer,
but it was as cold ant lifeless as marble.
Becky took it, however, with grateful humility; and performing a
reverence which would have done credit to the best daneing master, put
herself at Lady Steyne's feet, as it were, by saying that his Lordship had
heen ler father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Becky, had
learned to honour and respeet the Steyne family from the days of her
cluildhool. The fact is, that Lord Steyne had onee purchased a couple
of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could neer
Iorget her gratitude for that favour.
The Lady Bareacres then came under Becky's eoguizance-to whom
the Colonel's lady made also a most respectful obeisance : it was returned
with severe dignity by the exalted person in question.
I had the pleasure of mking your Ladyship's acquaintanee at
Brussels, ten years ago,'' Becky said, in the most winning manner. I
lad the good fortune to mect lLady Breacres, at the Duchess of Rich-
mond's ball, the niglt before the buttlce of Waterloo. And I recollect
your adyhip, and my Lady Blancle, your daughter, sitting in the csr-
riage in the porte-cochire at the Inn, wuiting for horses. I hope your
ILadyship's liamonds are safe,''
Everybody's eyes looked into tleir neighbour's. Thc famous diamonds
had undergone a famous seizure, it appears, about which Becky, of
course, knew nothing. Rawdon Crawley retreatel with Lord Southdown
into a window, wherce the latter was heard to laugh immoderately, as
Rawdon told him the story of Lady Bareacres wanting lorses, and
`knuekling down by Joe,' to Mr. Crawley. 'I think I needn't be
afraid of tlat woman,'' Becky thought. Indeed, Lady Bareacres
exchanged terrified and angry looks witl her dauglter; and retreated
to a table, where she began to look at piclures with great energy.
When the Potentate from the Danube male his appearancee, the
conversation was carried on in the French language, and the Lady
Bareacres and the younger lalies found, to their farther mortification,
that Mrs. Crawley was much better acquainted with that tongue, and
spoke it with a much better accent than they. Becky had met other
Hungarian magnates with the army in France, in 18l6-17. She asked
after her friends with great interest. The foreigu personages thought
that she was a lady of great listinction; and the Prince and the Princess
asked severally of Lord Steyne and the Marchioness, whom they conducted
to dinner, who was that petite dame wlo spoke so well

But it was when the ladies were alone that Beeky knew the tug of wr
would come. And then indeed the little woman found herself in such a
situation, as made her acknowledge the correetness of Lord Steyne's
cnution to her to beware of the society of ladies abovae her own sphere.
As they say the persons who hate Irishmen most are Irishmen; so,
assuredly, the greatest tyrants over women are women. When poor little
Becky, alone with the ladies, went up to the fire-place whither the great
ladies had repaired, the great ladies marched awny and took possessiou of
a table of drawings. When Becky followed them to the table of drawings
they dropped off one by one to the fire again. She tried to speak to on
of the children (of whom she ws commonly fond in publio places,) but

MIaster George Gaunt was called away by his mamma; and the stranger
was treated with such cruelly finally, that even Lady Steyne herself pitied
her, and went up to speak to the friendless little woman.
Lord Steyne,'' said her Ladyship, as her wan cheeks glowed with
a blush, `` snays you sing and play very besutifully, Mrs. Crawley-I wish
you would do me the kindness to sing to me.''
I will do anything that may gie pleasure to my Lord Steyne or to
you,'' said Rebecca, sincerely grateful, und seating herself at the piano,
began to sing.
She sang religious songs of Mozart, which had been early favourites of
Lady Stcyne, and with such swectness and tenderness that the lady
lingering round the piano, sate down by its side, aud listened until the
tears rolled down her cyes. It is true thut the opposition ladies nt the
othcr end of the room kept up a loud and ceeaseless buzzing and talking:
but the Iady Steyne did not hear those rumoure. She was a child again
--and had wnndered back through a forty years' wilderness to her Convent
Garden. The chapel organ had pealed the same tones, the organist, the
sistcr whom she loved best of the community, had taught them to her in
those carly happy days. he was a girl once more, and the brief period
of her happiness bloomed out again for an hour-she started when the
jarring doors were flung open, and with a loud laugh from Lord Steyne,
tle men of the party entercd full of gaiety.
IIe saw at a glance whnt had happened in his absenee: and was grate-
ful to his wife for onee. He went and spoke to her, and cslled her by her
Christin name, so as again to bring blushes to her ple face-``My wife
swys you have been singing like an angel,'' he said to Becky. Now there
are angels of two kinds, and both sorts, it is snid, are charming in
their way.
WYhatever the previous portion of the cvening hnd been, the rest of that
night was a great triumph for Becky. She sang her very best, and it was
so good that every one of the men came and crowded round the piano.
The women, hcr enemies, were left quite alone. And Mr. Paul Jefferson
Jones thought he had made a conquest of Lady Gunt by going up to her
ILndyship, and praising her delightful friend's first-rate singing.

presides over this Comic Hlis-
tory must now descend from
the genteel heights in which
she has been soaring, and have
the goodness to drop down
pon the lowly roof of John
Sedley nt Brompton, and dc-
seribe what events are taking
place there. IIere too, in this
humble tenement, live care,
nnd distrust, and lismay. Mrs.
Clpp in thc kitchen is gru-
bling in secret to her husband
about the rent, and urgiug the
good fellow to rcbel against hia
old friend and patron and his
present lodgcr. Mrs. Sedley has censed to visit her lnndlady in the lower
regions no, and indeed is in n position to patronise Mrs. Clapp no
longer. Iow cn one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes
a matter of forty pound, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for
the money The Irish maidservant has not altered in the least in her
kind and respectful behaviour; but Mrs. Sedley fancies that she is growing
insolent and ungrateful, and, as the guilty thief who fenrs each bush an
officer, sees tleatening innuendoes and hints of capture in all the girl's
speeches and answers. Miss Clapp, grown quite a young woman now, is
declared by the soured old laly to be an unbearable and impudent little
minx. Why Amelia can be so fond of her, or have her in her room so
much, or walk out with her so constantly, Mrs, Sedley cannot coneeive.
The bitterness of poverty hs poisonel thc life of the once cheerful and
kindly woman. She is tlankless for Amelin's constant and gentle bearing
towards hcr; carps nt her for her efforts at kindness or service; rails at
her for her silly pride in her child, nnd her neglect of her parents. Georgy's
house is not a very lively one since uncle Jos's annuity has been withdrawn,
and the little family are almost upon famine diet.
Amelia thinks, and thinks, and raeks her brnin, to find some means of
increasing the small pittance upon which the houschold is starving. Cnn
she give lessons in anything? paint card-racks? do fine work? She finds
that women are working hard, and better than she can, for twopence
a-day. She buys a couple of begilt Bristol boards ant the Fancy Stationer's,

and paints her very best upon them-a shephcrd with a red waistcoat
on one, and a pink face smiling iu the midst of a pencil landscape-a
slepherdess on the other, crossing a little bridge, with a little dog, nieely
shaded. lhe man of the Fancy epository and Brompton Emporium of
Fine Arts, (of whom she bought the screens, vainly hoping that he would
re-purchase them when omnamented by her hand), can hardly hide the sneer
with which he examines these feeble works of art. He looks askance at the
lady who waits in the shop, and ties up the cards asgain in their enelope of
whitey-brown paper, and hands them to the poor wvilow nnd Miss Clspp,
who had never seen such benutiful things in her life, and nd been quitc
confident that the man must give at leasst two guiness for the sereens.
They try at other shops in the interior of London, with faint sickening
hopes. `` Dont wnnt 'em,'' says one.  Be off,'' says another fiercely.
Three and sixpence have been spent in vain-the screens retire to Miss
Clapp's bel-room, who persists in thinking them lorely.
She writes out a little card in her neatest haud, and after long thought
and labour of composition; in which the public is informed that'`A Lady
who has some time nt her disposal, wishes to undertake the education of
some little girls, whom she would instruct in English, in French, in
Geograply, in History, and in Music-address A. O., at Mr. Brown's;''
and she confides the card to tle gentleman of the Fine Art Repositor, who
consents to allow it to lie upon the counter, where it grows dingy and
flyblown. Amelia passes the door wistfully many a tie, in hopes that
Mr, Brown will have some news to give her ; but he never beckons her in.
When she goes to make little purchases, there is no news for her. Poor
simple lady, tender and weak-how are you to battle with the struggling,
violent world
She grows daily more care-woru and sad : fixing upon her child alarmed
eyes, whereof the little boy cannot interpret the expression. She starts up
of a night and peeps into his room stealthily, to see that he is sleeping and
not stolen away. She sleeps but little now. A constant thought and
terror is haunting her. How she weeps and prays in the long silent nights,
-how she tries to hide from lerself the thought which will return to her,
that she ought to part with the boy,-that she is the only barrier between
him and prosperity. She can't, she can'tI Not now, at least. Some
other day. Ohl it is too hard to think of and to bear.
A thought comes over her which makes her blush and turn fromn hersolf,
--her parents might keep the annuity-the curate would marry her and
gie a home to her and the boy. But George's picture and dearest memory
are there to rebuke her., Shame and loe say no to tle sacrifice. She
shrinks from it as from something unholy; and such thoughts never found
a resting-place in that pure and gentle bosom.
The combat, which we describe in a sentence or two, lasted for many
weeks in poor Amelia's heart: during which, she had no confidante: indecd,
she oould have none : as she woull not allow to herself the possibility of
yielding: though she was giving way daily before the enemy ith wlom
she had to battle. One truth after another wns marshalling itself silently
against her, and keeping its ground. Poerty and misery for all, want and
degradation for her parents, injustice to the boy-one by one the outworks

of the little citadel were taken, in which tle poor soul pussionately guarded
her ouly love and treasure.
At the beginning of the struggle, she hal written off a letter of tender
supplication to her brother at Calcutta, imploring him not to withdraw thce
support which he had granted to their parents, anl painting in terms of
nrtless pathos their lonely and hapless condition. She did not know the
truth of the matter. The payment of Jos's nnnuity was still regular: but
it was a money-lender in the city who was receiving it : old Sedley had sold
it for a sum of money wherewith to prosecute his bootless schemes. lmmy
was calculating eagerly the time thut would elapse before the letter would
arrive and be answered. She had written down the date iu her pocket-book
of the day when she dispatched it. To her son's guardian, the good Major
nt Maudras, sle had not communicated any of her griefs and perplexitics.
She had not written to him since she wrote to congratulate him on his
approaching marriage. She tliought with sickening despondeney, that that
friend,-the only one, the one who had felt such a regard for her,-was
fallen away.
One dny, when things had come to a very bad pass-when the ereditors
were pressing, the mother in hysterie grief, the father in more thah usual
gloom, the inmates of the family avoiding each othcr, each secretly
oppressed with his private unlappiness and notion of wrong-the father
and daughter happened to be left alone together; and Amelia thought to
comfort her fuather, by telling him what she had done. She had written
to Joseph-an answer must come in three or four months. He was
always generous, though careless. IIe could not refuse, when hc knew
how struitened the circumstances of his parents.
Then the poor old gentleman rcvealed the whole truth to her-that
lis son was still paying the annuity, whicl his own imprudence had flung
away. He had not dured to tell it sooner. IIe thought Amelia's ghastly
and terrified look, when, with a trembling, miserable voice he made the
confession, conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment. ``Ahl''
sid he, with quivering lips and turning away, ``you despise your old
father now.''
O Papal it is not that,'' Amelia cried out, falling on his neck, and
kissing him many times.  You are always good and kind. You did it
for the best. It is not for the money-it is-O my Godl my God1
havre mercy upon me, and give me strength to bear this trinl;'' and she
kissed him again wildly, and went away.
Still the father did not know what that explanation meant, and the
burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him. It was that sle was
eonquered. The sentence was passed. The child must go from her-to
others-to forget her. Her heart and her treasure-her joy, hope, love,
worship-her God, almostl She must give him up; and then-and thcen
she would go to George; and they would watch oer the child, and wait
for him until he came to them in Heaven.
She put on her honnet, scarcely knowing what she did, and waent out to
walk in the lanes by which George used to come back from school, and
where she was in the habit of goiug on his return to meet the boy. It
was May, a half holiday. The leaves were all coming out, the weather

was brilliant: tle boy came running to her, flushed with lealth, singing,
his bunlle of school-books hanging by n thong. There he was. Both
her arms were round him. No, it was impossible. They could not be
going to part.  What is the matter, mother :'' said he; `` you look
very pale.''
 Nothing, my child,'' she said, and atooped down and kissed him.
That night Amelia made the hoy real the story of Samuel to her, and
how Hannah, his mother, having weaned him, brought him to Eli the ligh
riest to minister before the Lord. And he read the song of gratitude
which Hannah sang: and which says, Who it is who maketh poor anl
maketh rich, and bringeth low and exalteth-how the poor shall be raised
up out of the dust, and how, in his own might, noe man shall be strong.
Then he read how Samuel's mother made him a little coat, and brought
it to hin from year to year when she came up to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And then, in her sweet simple way, George's mother made commentaries
to the boy upon this affecting story. How Hannah, tlough she loed
her son so much, yet gave him p because of her vow. And how she
must always have thought of him as she sate at home, far away, making
the little coat: and Samuel, she was sure, never forgot his mother: and
how happy she must have been as the time came (and the years pass away
very quick) when she slould see her boy, and how good and wise he
had grown. This little sermon she spoke with a gentle solemn voice,
nnd dry eyes, until she came to the account of their meeting-then the
discourse broke off suddenly, the tender heart overflowed, and taking the
boy to her breast, she rocked him in her arms, and went silently over lim
in a sintcd ngony of tears.
ler mind being made up, the widow began to take such measures as
seemed right to her for advancing the end whicl she proposed. One day,
MIiss Osborne, in Russell quare, (Amelia had not written the name or
number of the house for ten years-her youth, her early story came back
to her as she wrote the superscription)-one day Miss Osborne got a letter
from Amelia, wlich made ler blush very much and look towrds her father,
sitting glooming in his place at the other end of the table.
In simple terms, Amelia told her the reasons which had induced hcr to
change her mind respecting her boy. Her father hasd met with fresh mis-
fortunes, which had entirely ruined him. Her own pittance was aso smll
that it would barely cnable her to support her pareuts, and would not suf-
fice to give George the advntages which were his due. Great as her
suffrings would e at parting with him, she woull, by God's lelp, endure
them for the boy's sake. She knew that those to whom he was geing,
would do all in their power to make him bappy. She desribed his dispo-
sition, such as she fancied it; quick and impatient of control or harshness;
easily to be moved by love and kindness. In a postscript, she stipulatel
that she should lave a written agreement, that sle should see the child as
eften as she wished,-she could uot part with him under any other terms.
Whatf Mrs. Pride has comc down, has she ?'' old Osborne said, when
with n tremulous eager voice Miss Osborne read him the letter-''Reglar

dignity nnd to read his paper as usul,-but hc could not follow it. IHIe
chuckled and swore to himself behind the sheet.
At last he flung it down: and scowling at his daughter, as his wont was,
went out of the room iuto his study adjoining, from whence he presently
returnedl with a key. He flung it to Miss Osborne.
`:Get the room over mine-his room that wns-ready,'' he snid.
 Yes, sir,'' his daughter replied in a tremble. It was George's room.
It had not been opened for more than ten years. Some of his clothes,
papers, handkerchiefs, whips and caps, fishing-rods and sporting gear,
were still there. An army list of 1814, with his name written on the
cover; a little dictionary he was wont to use in writing; nand the Bibl
his mother had given him, were on the mantel-piece; with a pair of spurs,
and a dried inkstand coered with the dust of ten yenrs. Ahl since that
ink was wet, what days and people had passed awayl The writing-book
still on the table, was blotted with his hand.
MIiss Osborne was much affected when she first entered this room withl
the servants under her. She sank quite pale on the little bed. This is
blessed news, mam-indeed, mnm,'' the housekeeper said; `` and the
good old times is returning, mam. The denr little feller, to be sure,
mam; how happy he will bel But some folks in May Fair, mam, will
owe him a grudge, mam;'' and she clicked back the bolt which held the
window-sash, and let the air into the chamber.
 You had better send that woman some money,'' Mr. Osborne said,
before he went out. `She shan't want for nothing. Send her a hundred
pound.''
`An I 'll go and see her to-morro ?'' Miss Osborne asked.
That 's your look out. She don't come in here, mind. No, by-,
not for all the money in London. But she mustn't want now. So look
out, and get things right.'' With which brief speeches Mr. Osborne
took lease of his laughter, and went on his accustomed way into the City.
e Here, Papa, is some money,'' Amelia said that night, kissing the old
man, her father, and putting n bill for n hundred pounds into his hands.
 And-and, Mammn, don't be harsh with Georgy. He-he is not
going to stop with us long.'' She could say nothing more, and walked
nway silently to her roo. Let us close it upon her prayers and her
sorrow. I think we had best speak little about so much love and grief.
Miss Osborne cnme the next day, according to the promise contained
in her note, and saw Amelia. The meeting between them was friendl.
A look and a few words from Miss Osborne showed the poor widow, that,
with regard to this woman at least, there need be no fear lest she ehould
take the first place in her son's affeetion. She was cold, sensible, not
unkinl. The mother hd not been so well pleased, perhaps, had the rival
been bctter looking, younger, ore affectionate, warmer-hearted. Miss
Osborne, on the other hand, thought of old times and memories, and
could not but be touehed with the poor mother's pitiful situation. Bhe
wns conquered, and, laying down her arms as it were: she humbly sub-
mittel. That lay they arranged together tle preliminaries of the treaty
of cnpitulation.
George was kept from school the next day, and saw his aunt. Amelia
let them alone together, and went to her room. She wus trying the

separation :-as that poor gentle Lady Jane Grey felt the edge of the axe
that was to come down and sever her slender life. Days were passed in
parlcys, visits, preparations. The widow broke the matter to Georgy
with great csution; she looked to see him very much affected by the
intelligence. He was rather elated than otherwise, and the poor woman
turned sadly away. He bragged about the news that day to the boys at
school ; told them how he was going to live with his grandpapa, his
father's father, not the one who comes here sometimes; and that he
would be very rich, and have a carriage, and a poney, and go to a much
finer school, and when he was rich he would buy Leader's pencil-case, and
pay the tart woman. The boy was the image of his father, as his fond
mother thought.
Indeed I have no heart, on acceount of our dear Amelia's sake, to g
through the story of George's last dsys at home.
At Iast the day came, the carriage drove up, the little humble packets
containing tokens of love and remembranee were ready and disposed in the
hall long sinee-George was in his new suit, for which the tailor had come
previously to measure him. He had sprung up with the sun and put on
tle new clothes; his mother hearing him from the room close by, in which
she had been lying, in speechless grief and watching. Days before she
had been making preparations for the end : purchasing little stores for the
oy's use; marking his hooks and linen; talking with him and preparing
lim for the change-fondly fancying that he needed preparation.
So that he had change, what cared he He was longing for it. Bya
thousand eager declarations as to what he would do, when he went to lie
with his grandfather, he had shown the poor widow how little the idea of
parting had cnst him down.  He ould come and see his mamma often
on thc poney,'' he said: ``he would come and fetch her in the carriage;
they would drive in the Park, and sle slould have evrerything she wanted.''
The poor rotler was fain to content hcrself with these selfish demonstra-
tions of attachmeut, and tried to convince herself how sincerely her son
loved her. He must loe her. All children were so: a little anxious
for novelty, and-no, not selfish, but self-illed. Her child must have his
enjoyments and ambition in the world. She herself, by her own selfishness1
and imprudent love for him, had denied him his just rights and pleasures
hitherto.
I know few things more affecting than that timorous debasement and
self-humiliation of a woman. How she owns that it is she and not the
man who is guilty: how she takes all the faults on her side: how she
courts in a manner punishment for the wrongs which she has not com-
mitted, and persists in shielding the real culpritl It is those who injure
women who get the most kindness from them-they are born timid and
tyrants, and maltrcat tlose who are humblest before them.
So poor Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her son's
departure, and had passed many and many a long solitary hour in making
preparations for the end. George stood by his mother, watching her arrange-
ments without the least concern. Tears had fallen into his boxes; passages
had been scored in his faourite books: old toys, relics, treasures had been
hoarded away for him, and packed with strange neatness and care,-and
of all these things the boy took no note. The child goes away smiling

as the mother breks her heart. By heavens it is pitiful, the bootless loe
of women for children in Vanity Fuair.
A few days are past: and the great event of Amelia's life is consum-
mated. No angel has intervened. The child is sacrificed and offered up
to fate: and the widow is quite alone.
The boy comes to see her often, to be sure. He rides on a poney with
the eoachman behind him, to the delight of his old grandfather, Sedley,
who walks proudly down the lane by his side. She sees him, but he h not
her boy any more. Why, he rides to see the boys at the little school, too,
and to show off before them his new wealth and splendour. In two
lays he has adopted a slight imperious air and patronising manner. He
was horn to commanl, his mother thinks, as his father was before him.
It is fine weather now. Of evenings on the days when he does not

house. It is so pleasant and cool. She can look up and see the drawing-
room windows illuminated, and, at about nine o'clock, the chamber in the
upper story where Georgy sleeps. She knows-He has told her. She
prays there as the light goes out, prays with a humble humble heart,
and walks home slrinking and silent. She is very tired when she comes
home. Perhaps she will sleep the better for that long weary walk; and
she may dream about Georgy.
One Sunday she happened to be walking in RBussell-square, at some dis-
tance from Mr, Osborne's house (she could see it from a distance though)
when all the bells of Sabbath were ringing, and George and his aunt
came out to go to church; a little sweep asked for charity, and the footman,
who carried the books, tried to drive him away; but Georgy stopped and
guve him money. May Godl's blessing be on the boy1 Emmy ran round
the square, and coming up to the sweep, gave him her mite too. All te
bells of abbath were ringing, and she followed them until she came to the
oundliug Churcl, into which she went. There she sat in a place whencee
slec could sece thc head of thc boy under his father's tombstone. Many
hundrcd fresh children's veices rose up there and seghymns to the Father
Benelicet; and little George's soul thrilled with elight at the burst of
glorious psalmoly. 1Iis other could not see him for awhile, through
the ist that dimed ler eyes.

were settled; and some of the
ery gretest and tallest doors
in the metropolis were speedily
opened to her-doors so great
and tall that the beloved reader

time. He can't survive the
glare of fashion long. It sceorches
him up, as the prcsence of Jupiter in full dress wasted that poor impru-
dent Semele-a giddy moth of a creature who ruined herself by venturing
out of her natural atmosphere. Her myth ought to be taken to heart
amongst the Tyburuians, the Belgravians,-her story, and perhaps Beeky's
too. Ah, lndies l-sk the overend Mr. Thurifer if Belgravia is not a
sounding brass, and Tyburnia a tinkling cymbl. These are vanities.
Even these will pass away. And some day or other (but it will be after

compliment Mrs. Crawley in the Ring of yde Park with a profound
salute of the hat. She and her husbnnd were invited immediately to one
of the Prince's sall prties at Levant Housc, then oecupied by his
Highness during the temporary absence from England of its noble
proprietor. She sung after dinuer to a very little comite. The Marquis
of Steyne was present, paternally superintending the progress of his pupil.
At Levant Iouse Becky met one of the finest gentlemen and greatest
ministers that Lurope has produced-the Due de ls Jabotiire, then
Ambassador from the Most Christian King, and subsequently Minister to
that monarch. I declare I swell with pride as these august names are
transcribed by my pen; and I think in what brillinnt company my dear
Becky is moving. She became a constant guest at the French Embassy,
where no party was considered to be complete without the presence of the
charming Madame Ravdonn Crawley.
Messieurs de Truffigny (of the Perigord family) and Champignac, both
nttaches of the Embassy, were straightway smitten by the charms of the
fair Colonel's wife : and both declared, according to the wont of theis
nation, (for who ever yet met a Frenchman, come out of England, that
has not left half a dozen families miserable, and brought away as many
hearts in his pocket-book f) both, I say, declared that they were au mies
with the charming Malame Ravdonn.
But I doubt the correctness of the assertion. Champignac was ery

fond of dcarte, and made many parties with the Colonel of evenings,
while Becky was singing to Lor teyne in the other room; and as for
Truffigny, it is a well-known fac that he dared not go to the Travellers',
where he owed money to the waiters, and if he had not hnd the Embassy
ns a dining-place, the worthy young gentlemnn must have starved.
I doubt, I say, that Becky would have selected either of these young
men as a person on whom she would bestow her special regard. They
ran of her messages, purchased her gloves and flowers, went in debt for
onera-hoxes for her, and made themselves amiable in a thousand ways.
And tley talked English with adorable simplicity, and to the constant
nmusement of Becky and my Lord Steyne. She would mimic one or
other to his faee, and compliment him on his advance in the English
language with a gruvity which never fuiled to tickle the Marquis, her
sardonic old patron. Truffiguy gave Briggs a shnwl by way of winning
over IBecky's confidante, and asked her to tnke charge of n letter which
the simple spinster handed over in public to the person to whom it was
addressed; anl the composition of which amused everybody who read it
greatly. Lord Steyne read it : cverybody, but honest Rawdon; to whom
it was not necessary to tell everything that passed in the little house in
Msy Fsir.
Here, before long, Becky receivel not only `'the best'' foreigners (as
the phrase is in our uoble and admirable society slang), but some of the
best English people too. I dont mean tle most virtuous, or indeed the
least virtuous, or the clcverest, or the stupidest, or tle richest, or the best
born, but ``the best,''-in a word, people about whom there is no question
-such as the great Lady Fit-Willis, that Patron Snint of Alack's, the
great Lady Slowbore, the great Lady Grizzel Maceth, (she wns Ludy
G. Glowry, dughter of Lord Grey of Glowry,) and the like. When the
Countess of Fitz-Willis (her ldyship is of the Kingstreet family, see
Debrett and Burkc,) takes up a person, he or sle is safe. There is no
question about tlem any more. Not tlat my Lndy Fitz-Willis is any better
than anybody else, being, on the eontrary, a fadetd person, fifty-seven years
of age, and neither hnndsome, nor wenlthy, nor entertaining; but it is
agreed on all sides thnt she is of the ``best people. Those who go to her
are of the best: and from an old grudge'' probably to Lndy Steyne (Jor
whose eoronet her ladyslip, then the youthful Georgina Frelerica, dughter
of the Prince of Wales's favourite, the Earl of Portansherry, had once tried),
this great and famous leader of the fashion chose to aeknowledge Mrs. Ruw-
don Crawley: made her a most marked curtsey at the assembly over which
she presided: and not only eneouraged her son, St. Kitts (his lordship got
his place through Lord Steyne's interest), to frequent Mrs. Crawley's house,
but asked her to her own mansion, and spoke to her twice in the most
public and condescending manncr during dinner. The important fact was
known all over London that night. People who had been crying fie
about Mrs. Crawley, were silent. Wenham, the wit and lawyer, Lord
Steyne's right-hand muan, went about everywhere praising her: some
who had hesitated, came forward at once and welcomed her: little Tom
Toady, who hnd warned Southdown about visiting such an abandoned
woman, now besought to be introduced to her. In a word, she was

admitted to be among the ``best'' people. Ah, my beloved readers and
brethren, do not envy poor Becky prematurely-glory like this is snid to
be fugitive. It is currently reported that even in the very inmost circles,
they are no happier than the poor wanderers outside the zone; and Becky,
who penetrated into the very centre of fashion, and saw the great George IV.
face to face, has owned since thnt there too was Vanity.
We must be brief in descanting upon this prt of her career. As I can-
not leseribe the mysteries of freemasonry, although I hnve a shrewd iden
that t is a humbug: so an uninitiated man cannot take upon himself to
pourtray the great world accurately, and had best keep his opinions to
himself whatever they are.
lBecky has often spoken in subsequent years of this season of her life,
when she moved amongg the very greatest circles of the London fashion.
Her success excited, elated, and then bored her. At first no occupation
was more pleasant than to invent and procure (the latter a work of no
small trouble and ingenuity, by the way, in a person of Mrs. Rawdon
Crawley's very narrow mens)-to procure, we say, the prettiest new
dresses and ornaments; to drive to fine dinner parties, where she was
weleomed by great people; and from the fine dinner parties to fine assem-
blies, whither the same people came with whom she had been dining, whom
she had met the night before, and would see on the morrow-the young
men fnultlessly appointed, handsomely cravatted, with the neatest glossy
boots and white gloves-the elders portly, brass-buttoned, noble-looking,
polite, and prosy-the young ladies blonde, timid, and in pink-the
mothers grand, bcautiful, sumptuous, solemn, and in diamonds. They
talkel in English, not in bad French, as they do in the noels. They
talked about each others' houses, and characters, and families : just as the
Joneses do about the Smniths. Beeky's former aequaintances hated and
enviel her: the poor woman herself was yawning in spirit.  I wish I
were out of it,'' she said to herself. I would rather be a parson's wife,
nnd teach a Sundny chool thnn this; or a sergeant's laly and ride in
the regimental waggon; or, O how much gayer it would be to wear spangles
and trowsers, and dance before a booth at n fair,''
 You would do it very well,'' snid Lord Steyne, laughing. She used
to tell the great man her ennueia and perplexities in her artless way-they
amused him.
'' Rawdon would make a very good Ecuyer--Mnster of the Ceremonies-
what do you cnll him-the man in the large boots and the uniform, whao
goes round the ring craeking the whip He is large, heavy, and of a
military figure. I reeollect,'' Becky eontinued, pensiely, ``my futher

we came home I made myself a pair of stilts, and danced in the studio to
the wonder of all the pupils.''

where they sate in silence, and shaking hands with them, and smiling in
the view of all persons. She was an artist herself, ns she ajd very
truly: there was a frankness and humility in the manner in which sho
ancknowledged her origin, which provoked, or disarmed, or amused
lookers-on, as the cnse might be. How cool that woman is,'' said one;
``what airs of inlependence she assumes, where she ought to sit still and
be thnnkful if anyody speaks to her.''  What an honest and good-
natured soul she is,'' said another. e What an artful little minx,'' suid a
third. They were nll right very likely; but Becky went her own way,
and so fascinated the professional personages, thut they would lenve off
their sore throats in order to sing at her parties, and give her lesons for
nothing.
Yes, she gave parties in the little house in Curzon Street. Many scores
of carriages, with blazing lamps, blocked up the street, to the disgust of
No. 100, who could not rest for thue thunder of the knocking, and ol 102,
who could not sleep for envy. The gignntic footmen who accompnied
the vehicles, were too big to be contained in Becky's little hall, and were
billeted off in the ncighbouring public-houses, whence, when they were
wanted, cll-boys summoned them from their beer. fSome of the great
landies of London sueezed and trod on each other on the little stairs,
laughing to find themselvcs there; and many spotless and severe ladies of
ton were seated iu the little druwing-room, listening to the professioual
singers, who were singing according to their wont, and ns if they wished
to blow the windows down., Aud the day after, there appeared among
the fashionable reuuions in the  Morning Post,'' a paragraph to the
following effect:-
Yesterdlay, Colonel and Mrs. Crawley entertained a select party at dinner
at their house in May Fuir. heir Excellencics the lrince and lrincess
of Peterwaralin, H. E. Papoosh Pasha, the lurkish Ambssalor (attended
by Kibob bBey, dragoman of the mission), the Marquess of Steyne, Earl of
Southdown, Mr. Pitt and Lady Jane Crawley, Mr. Wagg, &c. After
dinner Mrs. Crawley had an assembly which was attended by the bDuchess
(Dowager) of Stilton, Duc de la Gruyere, Marchioness of Cheshire, Mar-
chese Alessaudro Strachino, Comte de Brie, Baron Schapzuger, Chevalier
Tosti, Countess of tSlingstone, anl ILndy F. Macadam, Mnjor-Gdeneral anl
Ialy G. Mnebcth, and (2) Miss Macbeths; Viscount addington, Sir
Horace Fogey, Hon. Sands Bedwin, Bobbachy Bahawder,'' and an &c.
which the reader may fill at his pleasure through a dozen close lines of
small type.
And iu her commerce with the great our lenr friend showed the same
fraukness whieh distinguished her transnctions with the lowly in stution.
Ou one oceasion, when out at a very fine house, Rebeeea was (perhps
rathcr ostentatiously) holding a conversation in the llrench languuge with
a celebruted tenor singer of tat nation, while the Lady Grizzel Mlncbeth
looked over her shoulder scowling at the puir.
How very well you speak Freneh,'' ILndy Grizzel said, who herself
spoke the tongue in a Edinburgh accent most rearkable to hear.
I ought to know it,'' Becky modestly said, casting down her eyes.
e I taught it in a school, and my mother was a Frenchwoan.''

vAIFY AIR.
Lady Grizzel was won by her humility, and was mollified towards the
little woman. She deplored the fatal levelling tendencies of the age, which
almitted persons of all classes into the society of their superiors: but her
ladyship owned, that this one at lenst was well behaed and never forgot
her place in life. She was a very good woman: good to the poor: stupd,
blameless, unsuspicious.-It is not her ladyship's fault that she fancies
herself better thnn you and me. he skirts of her aneestors' garments
have been kissed for centuries: it is n thousand yenrs, they say, since the
tartans of the head of the family were embraced by the defunet Duncan's
lords, nand councillors, when the great ancestor of the louse became hing
of Sootland.
Lady Steyne, nfter the music scene, succumbed before Becky, and perhaps
was nut disinclinel to her. The younger lndies of the house of Gaunt were
also compelled into submission. Once or twice thcy set people at her, but
they failel. The brilliant Lady Stunnington tricd a passage of arms with her,
bnt was routed with grent slaughter by the intrepid little Becky. When
attacked sometimes, lBeeky had a knack of adopting a demure ingeiue air,
nder which she was most dangerous. She snid the wicekedest things with
the most simple unaflecetel air when in this mood, and would take cnre
artlessly to npologise for her blunders, so that all the worll should know
that she lad male them.
M. WVngg, the celebrated wit, and a led captain and trencher-man of
my Lord teyne, wns cuused by thc ladies to chnrge her; and the worthy
fellow, leering at his pantronesses, and giving them a wiuk, as much as to
say, ` Now look out for sport,''-one evening began an nssault upon
Beeky, who wss unsuspicuously eating her dinner. The little womnn,
attacked on a sudden, but never without arms, lighted up in an
inetant, parried and reposted withi a home-thurst, which made Wagg's
fnce tingle withl shame; then she rcturned to her soup with the most
perfect calm and a quiet smile on her face. Wngg's great patron, who
gnve him dinners and lent him n ittle money sometimes, nnd whose elec-
tion, newspaper, nnd other jobs Wagg did, gave the luekless fellow such
a savage glance with the cyes as almost mude him sink under the tnble
and burst into tears. He looked piteously at my lord, who never spoke
to him during dinner, and ant the ladies, who disowned him. At last
Beeky herself took compassion upon him, and tried to engage him in
talk. He wns not asked to dinner again for six weeks ; anl Fiche, my
lord's confilential man, to whom Wagg natrally paid a good deal of
court, was instructed to tell him that if he ever dnred to sny a rude thing
to Mrs. Crawley agsin, or mak her the butt of his stupid jokcs, Milor
would put every one of his notes of hand into his lawyer's hands, and
sell him up withont mercy. Wagg wept before Fiche, and implored
his denr friend to intercde for himn. He wrote a poem in favour of
Mrg. R. C., hich nppenred in the very next number of the ``Harumscarum
Magazine,'' which he conlucted. lle implored her gool will at parties
where he met her. He cringed and conxed Rawdon at theelub. He was
allowed to come back to Gaunt louse after a while. Becky was alwayas

ment anat the dinner tablec), Mr. Wenham, was much more prudent in his
behaviour and opinions than Mr. Wngg. HIowever much he might be
disposed to hnte all pnrvenus (Mr. Wenhnm himself was a staunch old
True Blue Tory, nnd his father a small coal-merchant in the north of
England), this aide-de-camp of the Mnrquis never showed any sort of
hostility to the new favourite; but pursued her with stealthy kindnesses,
and a sly and deferential politeness, which somehow msde Becky more
uneasy thn other people's overt hostilities.
llIow the Crawleys got the money which was spent upon the entertain-
nents with which they treated the polite world, was a mystery which gave
rise to some conversation at the time, and probably added zest to these
little festivities. Some persons averred thnt tSir Pitt Crawley gave his
brother a handsome allowance: if he did, Becky's power over the
baronet must have been extraordinary indeed, and his characeter greatly
clanged in his advanced age. Other parties hinted that it was Becky's
habit to levy contributions on all her husbnnd's friends: going to this one
in tenrs with an account that there was an cxecution in the house; falling
on her knees to that one, and dcclariug thut the whole family must go
to gaol or commit suicide unless such nnd such a bill could be paid. Lord
Southdown, it was said, had been induced to give many hundreds through
these pathetic represeutations. oung Felthm, of the-th Dragoons (und
son of the firm of liler and Fcltham, hatters and army accoutrement
makers), and whom the Crawlcys introduccd into fashionable life, was
also cited as one of Beeky's victims in the pecunianry way. People declared
that she got money from various simply disposed persons, under preteee
of getting them confidential appointments under government. Who knows
what stories were or were not told of our dear and innocent friend 
Certain it is, that if shc had had all the money which she was said to
lave begged or borrowed or stolen, she might have capitalised and been
honest for life, whereas,-but this is ndvancing matters.
The truth is, that by economy and good management-by a sparing use
of ready money and by paying scurcely anybody,-people can mnnage, for
a time at least, to make a great show with very little means: and it is our
holief that Becky's mueh-tnlked-of parties, whieh were not, after all was
said, very numerous, cost this lady very little more than the wax candles
which lighted the walls. Stillbrook and Gueen's Crawley supplied her
with game and fruit in abundanee. Lord Steyne's cellars were at her
disposal, and thnt excellent nobleman's famous cooks presided over her
little kitchen, or scnt by my lord's order the ruarest delicncies from their own.
I protest it is quite shameful in the world to abuse a simple ereature, as
people of her time abuse Beceky, and I warn the public aguinst believing
one-tenth of the stories against her. If every person is to be banished
from society who runs into deht nnd cannot pay-if we are to be peering
iuto evcrybody's private life, speeulating upon their income, and cutting
them if we don't approve of thcir expenditure-why, what a howling
wilderuess and intolernble dwelling Vanity lFair would be. Every man's
hand would be against his neighbour in this case, my dear tSir, and the
benefits of civilisntion would be done nway with. We should be quarrelling,
abusing, avoidig oue nnother. Our houses would becore caverns: and

we shonld go in rags beeause we cared for nobody. Rents would go down.
Parties wouldn't be given any more. All the tradesmen of the town would
be bankrupt. Wine, wax-lghts, conestibles, rouge, crinoline-petticoats,
diamonds, wigs, Louis-uatorze-gimcracks, and old china, park hacks and
splendidhigh-stepping carriage horses-all the delightsof life, I say,-woull
go to the deuce, if people did but act upon their silly priuciples, and aoid
those whom they dilike and abuse. Whereas, by a little eharity and
mutual forbearance, things are made to go on pleasantly enough: we may
abuse a man as much as we like, and call him the greatest rascal unhung--
but do we wish to hang him therefore? No. We shake hands when we
meet. If his cook is good we forgive him, and go and dine with him;
and we expect he will do tle same by us. Thus trle flourishes-civili-
sation advances: peace is kept; new dresses are wanted for new assem-
blies every week; and the last year's viutage of Lafitte will remunerate
the honest proprietor who reared it.
At the time whereof we ure writing, though the Grent Gceorge was on
the throne and ladies wore gigots nnd large combs like tortoise-shell
shovels in their hair, instead of the simple sleeves and lovely wreaths
which are actually in fashion, the manners of thce very polite world were
not, I take it, essentially different from those of the present lay: and
their amusements pretty similar. To us, from outside gazing over the
policemen's shoulders at the bewildering beautics as they pass into Court
or ball, they may seem bcings of unenrthly splendour, und in the enjoy-
ment of an exquisite happiness by us unattainable. It is to console some
of thesee disatisfied beings, that we are narrating our dear Becky's struggles,
and triumphs, and disappointments, of nll of which, indeed, as is the case
with all persons of merit, she had her share.
At this time the amiable amusement of acting charades had comne
among us from France: and were considerably in vogue in this couutry,
enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their
charms, and the fewer number who had cleverness, to exhibit their wit.
My Lord Steyne was incited by Becky, who nerhnps believed herself
endowed with both the above qunlificuations, to give an cutertainment nat
Gaunt House, which should inelude some of these little dramas-and we
must take leave to introduce the reader to this brilliant reunion, and, with
a melancholy welcome too, for it will be among the very last of the
fashionable entertainments to which it will be our fortuue to conduct him.
A portion of that splendid room, the picture-gullery of Gaunt IIouse,
wns arranged as the charade theatre. It hnd been so usel when
George III, was king; and a picture of the Marquis of Gauut is still
extant, with his hair in powder and a pink ribbon, in a loman shape, as it
was called, enacting the part of Cato in Mr. Aldison's tragedy of that
name, performed before their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales, the
Bishop of Osnaburgh, and Prinee Willia leury, then children like the
actor. One or two of the old properties were drawn out of the gurrcts,
where they had lain ever since, and furbished up anew for the present
festivities.
Young Bedwin Sands, then an elegant dandy anl Enstern traveller, was
manager of the revels. An Lastern traveller was someboly in those daya,

anl the alventurous Bedwin, who had published his quarto, and passed
some months under the tents in the dcsert, was a personage of no smnll
importauce.-In his volume there were several pictures of Sands in
various oriental costumes; and he travelled about with a black attendant
of most unprepossessing appearance, just like another IBrian de Bois Guil-
bert. Bedwin, his costues, and bluck man, were hailel at Guunt House'
as very valuable aequisitions.
He led off the first charade. A Turkish officer with an immense plume
of feathers (the Janizzaries were supposed to be still in existence, and the
tarboosh had not as yet displaced the nncient nnd majestic heal-dress of
the true believers) was seen couched on a divan, and making believe to
puff at a narghile, in which, however, for the sake of the ladies, only a
fragrant pastille was allowed to smoke. The Turkish diguitary yawns
and expresses signs of weariness and idleness. He claps his hands and
Mesrour the Nubian appears, with bare arms, baugles, yataghans, and
every eastern ornnment-gaunt, tall, and hideous. He makes a salaam
before my lord the hgu.
A thrill of terror and delight runs through the assembly. The lndies
whisper to one another. The lacek slave was given to Sands Bedwin by
an lgyptian lasha in exchange for threce dozen of Maraschino. He hns
sown up ever so many odalisques in sacks and tiltel them into the Nile.
Bid the slave-merchant enter,'' says the Turkish voluptuary, with n
wave of his hand. Mesrour conduets the slave-merchant into my lord'
presence: he brings a veiled female with him. 1Ie remnoves her veil.
A thrill of applause bursts through the house. It is Mra, Winkworth (she
was a Miss Absolom) with tho benutiful eyes and hair. She is in a
gorgeous oricntal costume; the bluck braided locks are twined with
innumerable jewels; her dress is covered over with gold piastres. Tha
odions Mahometan expresses himself charmed by her beauty. She falls
down on her knees, and cntreats him to rcstore her to the mountains
where she wns born, and where her Circassian lovcr is still deploring the
nbsence of his Zuleikah. No entreaties will move the oblurate Hassan.
He laughs at the notion of the Circssian bridegroom. Znuleikah covers
her face with her hands, and drops down in an attitude of the most
beautiful despuair. There seems Lto be no hope for her, when-when the
Kislar Aga appears.
The Kislar Aga brings a letter from the Sultan. Hassan receives and
places on his hend the dread firman. A ghastly terror seizes him, while
on the negro's face (it is Mesrour again in another costue) appears a
ghastly joy. `Mercy1 mercy1'' cries the Pasha; while the kislar Aga,
grinning horribly, pulls out-a ow-string.
The curtain drnws just as he is going to nse that awful weapon.
Hassan from within bawls out, ` irst two syllables ''-and Mrs. Rawlon
Crawley, who is going to act in the charade, comes forward and ceom-
pliments Mrs. Winkworth on the amirable taste and beauty of her
costume.
The second part of thoe charade takes place. It is still an easteru
scene. Hnssan, in nnother dress, is in an nttitule by Zuleikah, who is
perfectly reconciled to him. The Kislar Aga has become a peaceful black

slave. It is sunrise on the desert, and the Turks turn their heads east-
wnrd and bow to the sand. As there are no dromedaries at hand, the
band facetiously plays the ` The Cnmels are coming.''  An enormous
Lgyptian head figures in the scene. It is a musical one,-and, to the
surprise of the orieutal travellers, sings a comic song, composel by Mr.
Wagg. The eastern voyagers go off dsneing, like Papageno and the
Moorish Ying, in the Magic Flute. `'Last two syllables'' roars the head.
The last act opens. It is a Grecian tent this time. A tall and stal-
wart man reposes on a couch there. Above him hang his helmet and
shield. There is no need for them now. Ilium is down. Iphigenia is
slain. Cassudra is a prisoner in his outer halla. The king of men (it is

Why, ehild, you are alwys laughing and siging,'' aud away she goes,

TIIE ROSE UPON MY BALCONY.
Tha rose upon my balcony the morning air perfuming,
Was leafless all the wintor time and pining for tho spring;
You ask me why her breath is sweet and why ler cheek is blooming
It is because the sun is out and birds begin to sing.
The nigltingale, whose mclody is through the grcenwood ringing,
Was ileut when the boughs were bare and winds were blowing keen:
And if, Miamma, you ask of mo thie reason of his singing;
It is becsuso the sun is out and ull the leavcs nre grcen.
Thus each performe his part, MInamma, the birds have found their voices,
Tho blowing rose a flush, Mamua, her honny cheek to dye;
And there's sunshine in my heart, Mammn, which wnken and rojolces,
And so lI sing and blush, Mama, and thnt's the reason why.
Durmng the intcrvals of the stanzas of this ditty, tle good-natured
personage addressed as mamma by the singer, and whose large whiskers
nppeared under her cap, seemed very anxious to exhibit her maternl
affection by embracing the innocent creature who performed the daughter'a
part. Every caress was received with loud acclamations of laughter by
the sympathising audience. At its conclusion (while the music was
performing a symphony as if ever so many birds were warbling) the whole
house was unanimous for an encore: and applause and bouquets without
eud were showered upon the NIGHITINGALB of the evening. Lord Steyne's
voice of applause was loudest of all. HBecky, the nightingnle, took the
flowers which he threw to her, and pressed them to her heart with the air
of a consummate comedian. Lord teyne was frantic with delight. His
guests' enthusiasm harmonised with his own. Where was the benutiful
black-eyed Houri whose appearance in the first charnde had caused
such delight. She was twice as handsone as Becky, but the brilliancy of
the latter had quite eelipsed her. All voices were for her. Stephens,
Caradori, Ronzi de HBegnis, people compared her to one or the other, and
agreed with good reason, very likely, that had she been an actress none
on the stage could have surpassed her. She had reached her culmination :
her voice rose trilling and bright over the storm of applause: and soared
as high and joyful ns her triumph. There was a ball after the dramatic
entertainments, and everybody pressed round Becky as tbe grent poiut of
attraction of the evening. The Royal Personage declared with an onth,
that she was perfcction, and engaged her again and ngain in conuversation.
Little Iecky's soul swelled with pride and delight at these honours; she
saw fortune, fame, fashion before her. Lord Stcyne was her slave;
followed her everywhere, and scarcely spoke to any one in the room
beside; and paid her thae most marked coplients aud attention.
She still appeared in her Marquise costume, and dunced a minuet with

the Duke, who had all the traditions of the ancient court, pronounced that
Mladame Crawley was worthy to have been a pupil of Vestris, or to have
figured at Versailles. Ouly a feeling of dignity, the gout, and the strongest
nsense of duty and personal sacrifice, prevented his Excellency from dancing
with her hiself; and he declared in public, that na lady wlo could talk and
dance like Mrs. Rawdon, was fit to be ambassadress at any court in Europe.
He was only consoled when he heard that she was half a Frenchwoman by
birth.  None but a compatriot,'' his Excellency declared, ``could hae
performed that majestic dauce in such a way.''
Then she figured in a waltz with Monsieur de Klingenspohr, the Prince
of Peterwaradin's cousin aud attache. The dclighted Prince, having less
retesue than his French diplomatic colleague, insisted upon taking a turn
with the charming creature, and twirled round the ball-room with her,
scnttering the diamond out of his boot-tassels and hussar jacket until his
highuess was fairly out of breath. Papoosh Pasha himself would have
liked to dance with her if that amusement had been the custom of his
country. The company made a circle round her, and applauded as wildl
as if she had been a Noblet or u Taglioni. Everybody was in ecstacy;
nnd Becky too, you may be sure. She passed by Lady Stunington with
n look of scorn. She patronised Lady Gaunt and her astonished and
mortified sister-in-luw-shie crasei all rival charmers. As for poor Mrs,
Winkworth, and her long hair and great eyes, which had made such an
effect nt the commcncement of the cvening; where was she now No-
where in the race. She might tenr her long hair aud cry her great eyes
out ; but there was not a person to heed or to deplore the discomfiture.
The greatest triumph of all was at supper time. She was placed at the
grand exclusive table with his Royal Highness the exalted personage before
mentioned, and the rest of the great guests. She was served on gold plate.
She might have had pearls melted into her champagne if she liked-another
Cleoputra; and the potentate of Peterwaradin would have given half the
brilliants off his jacket for a kind glance from those dazzling eyes. Jabotire
wrote home about her to his government. The ladies at the other tables,
who supped off mere silver, and marked Lord Steyne's constant attention
to her, vowed it was a monstrous infatuntion, a gross insult to ladies ol
rank. If sarcasm could hnve killed, Lady Stunnington would have slin
her on the spot.
Rawdon Crawley was scarel at these triumphs. They seemed to sep-
rate his wife farther than ever from him somehow. He thought witha
feeling very like pain how immeasurably she was his superior.
When the hour of departure came, a crowd of young men followed her
to her carriage, for which the people without bawled, the cry being caught
up by the link-men who were stationed outside the tall gates of Gaunt
House, congratulating each person who issued from the gte and hoping
his Lorlship had enjoyed this noble party.
MIrs. Rawdon Crawley's carriage, coming up to the gate ofter due shout-
ing, rattled into the illuminated court-yard, and droe up to the covered
way. Rawdon put his wife into the cnrriage, which drove off. Mr. Wen-
ham had proposed to him to walk home, and offered the Colonel ths
refreshment of a cigar.

They lighted their cigars by the lnmp of one of the many link-boys out-

sepurated from the crowd and followed the two gentlemen; and when they
hund walked down Gaunt Square a few score of paces, one of the men cme

the Crawley family did
the greatest honour to
his benevolent discrimi-
nation. His lordship
extended his good-will
to little Rawdon: he
pointed out to the boy's
parents the necessity of
sending him to a public
aschool; that he was of
an age now when emula-
tion, the first priuciples
of the Latin language,
pugilistic exercises, and
the society of his fellow-
boys would e of the grcatest benefit to the boy. His father objected that
he was not rich enough to send the child to a good public school; his
mother, that Briggs was a capital mistress for him, and had brought him
on (as inleed was the faet) famously in English, the Latin rudiments, and in
general learning: but all these objections disappeared before the generons
perseverance of the Marquis of Steyne. His lordship was one of the
goveruors of that famous old collegiate institution called the Whitefriars.
It had been a Cistercian Convent in old days, when the Smithfield, whicl
is contiguous to it, was a tournament ground. Obstinute heretics used to
be brought thither eonvenient for burning hard by. Harry VIII., tbe
Defender of the Fith, seized upon the monastery and its possessions, and
hanged and tortured some of the monks who could not accommodate them-
selves to the pace of his reform. Finally, a great merchant bought the house
and land adjoining, in which, and with the help of other wealthy endow-
ments of land and money, he established a famous foundation hospital for old
men and children. An extern school grew round the old almost mo-
nastic foundation, which subsists still with its middle-age costume and
usages: nnd nll Cistcrcians pray that it may long flourish.
Of this famous house, some of the greatest noblemen, prelates, and

dignitares in England are governors: and as the boys are very comfortably
lodged, fed, nnd educated, and subsequently inducted to good seholar-
ships at the University and livings in the Church, many little gentlemen
are devoted to the ecclesiastical profession from their tenderest years, and
there is considerable emulation to procure nominations for the founda-
tions. It was originally intended for the sons of poor and deserving
clerics and laics; but many of the noble governors of the Institution,
with an enlarged and rather capricious benevolence, selected all sorts of
objects for their bounty. To get an elucation for nothing, and a future
livelilhood and profession assured, was so excellent a scheme, that some
of the richest people did not disdain it; and not only great men's
relations, but grent men themselves, sent their sons to profit by the
chance-Right Rev. Prelates sent their own kinsmen or the sons of their
clergy, while, on the other hand, some great noblemen did not disduin
to patronise the children of their eonfidential servants,-so that a lad
entering this establishment had every variety of youthful society wherewith
to mingle.
Rawdon Crawley, though the only book which he studied was the
Racing Calendar, and though his chief recollections of polite learuing
were connected with the floggings which he reccived at lEton in his enrly
youth, had that decent and honest reverence for classical learning which ull
English gentlemen feel, and was glad to think thut his son was to have a
provision for life, perhaps, and a certain opportunity of becoming a
scholar. And nlthough his boy was his chief solace and companion,
and endeared to him by n thousnnd small tics, nbout which he did
not cuare to speak to his wife, who had all along shown the utost indif-
ference to their son, yet Rawdon agreed at onee to part with him, and to
give up his own greatest comfort and benefit for the sake of the welfare of
the little lad. He did not know how fond he was of the child until it
became necessary to let him go away. When he was gone, he felt more
sad and downcast than he cared to own-far sadder than the boy himself,
who was happy enough to enter a new career, and find companions of his
own age. Becky burst out laughing once or twice, when the Colonel, in
his clumsy, incoherent way, tried to express his sentimental sorrows at the
boy's departure. The poor fellow felt that his dearest pleasure and closest
friend wus taken from him. He looked often and wistfully at the little
vacant bed in his dressing-room, where the child used to sleep. He
missed him sadly of mornings, and tried in vain to walk in the Park
without him. He did not know how solitary he was until little Rawdon
was gone. He liked the people who were fond of him; and would go
and sit for long hours with his good-natured sister Lady Jane, nnd talk to
her nbout the virtues, and good looks, and hundred good qualities of the
child.
Young Rawdon's aunt, we have said, was very fond of him, as was her
little girl, who wept copiously when the time for her cousin's departure
came. The elder Rawdon was thankful for the fondness of mother and
daughter. The ery best and honestest feelings of the man came out in
these artless outpourings of paternal feeling in which he indulged in their
presence, and encouraged by their sympsthy. He secured not only
 H

Lady Jane's kindness, but her sineere regard, by the feelings which he
mnanifested, and which he could not show to his own wife. The two
kinswomen met as seldom as possible. Becky laughed bitterly at Jane's
feelings and softness; the other's kindly and gentle nature could not but
revolt at her sister's callous behaviour.
It estranged Rawdon from his wife more than he knew or ackuowledged
to himself. She did not care for the estrangement. Indeed, sle did not
miss him or anybody. She looked upon him as her errand-man and
humble slave. He might be ever so depressed or sulky, and she did not
mark his demeanour, or only treated it with a sneer. She was busy
thinking about her position or her pleasures or her advancement in societ;
she ought to have held a great place in it, that is certain.
It wss honest Briggs who made up the little kit for the boy which he
was to take to school. Molly, the housemaid, blubbered in the passage
when he went away-Molly kind and fuithful in spite of a long arrenr of
unpaid wages. Mrs. Becky could not let her husband have the carriage
to take the boy to school. Take the horses into the City !-such a thing
was never heard of. Let a cab be brought. She did not offer to kiss
him when he went: nor did the cild propose to embrace her: but gae
a kiss to old Briggs, (whom, in general, he was very shy of caressing), and
consolel her by pointing out that he was to come home on Saturdays,
when she would have the benefit of seeing him. As the cab rolled townrds
the City, Becky's carriage rattled off to the Prk. She was chattering
and laughing with a score of young dandies by the Serpentine, as the
father and son entered at the old guates of the school-where Rawdon left
the child, and came awuy with a sadder purer feeling in his heart than
perhans that poor battered fellow had ever known since he himself came
out of the nursery.
He walked all the vay home very dismally, and dined alone with Briggs.
e was very kind to her, and grateful for her love nnd watchfulness over
the boy. His conscience smote him that he had borrowed Briggs's money
and aided in deceiving her. They talked about little Rawdon a long time,
for Becky only cnme home to dress and go out to dinner-And then he
went off uneasily to drink ten with Lady Jane, anl tell her of what had
happened, and how little Rawdon went off like a trump, and how he was
to weur a gown and little knee-breeches, and how young Blackball, Jack
BInekball's son, of the old regiment, had taken him in charge and promised
to be kind to him.
In the course of a week, young Blackball had eonatituted little Rnwdon
his fag, shoe-black, and breakfast tonster ; initiated lim into the mysteries
of the Latin Grammar, and thrashed him three or four times; but not
severely. The little chap's good-natured honest face won his way for him.
He only got that degree of beating which was, no doubt, good for him;
and as for blaeking shocs, toasting bread, and fagging in general, were
these offices not deemed to be necessary parts of every young English
gentleman's education 2
Our business does not lie with the second generation and Master Raw-
don's life at school, otherwise the present tale might be carried to any
indefinite length. The Colonel went to see his son a short time after-

His fther sagaciously tipped Blaekball, his master, a sovereign, and
secured that young gentleman's gool will towards his fag. As a protee'
of the great Lord Steyne, the nephew of a County member, nand son of a
Colonel and C.B., whose name appeared in some of the most faslionable
parties in the Mforning Post, perhaps the school authorities were disposed
not to look unkindly on the child. He had plenty of pocket-money, which
he spent in treating his comrades royally to raspberry tarts, and he was
often allowed to oome home on aturdnys to his father, who always
made a jubilee of that day. When free, Rawdon would take him to the play,
or send him thither with the footman ; and on fSundays he went to church
with Briggs and Lady Jane and his cousins. Rawdon marvelled over his
stories about school, und fights, and fagging. Before long, he knew the
names of all the masters and the principal boys as well ass little Rawdon
himself. He invited little Rawdon's crony from sclool, and made both

tried to look knowing over the Latin grammar when little Rawdon showed

Berky's contempt for her husband grew greater every day,-'` Do hat
you like,-dine where you please,-go and huve ginger-bcer and aaw-dust
at Astley's, or psalm-singing with Lady Jane,-only don't expect me to
busy myself with the boy. I have your interests to attend to, as you
cnu't attend to them yourself. I should like to know where you would
have been now, and in what sort of a position in society, if I had uot
looked ufter you 2'' Indeed, nobody wanted poor old Rawdon at the parties
whither Becky used to go. She wns often asked without him now. She
talked about great people as if she had the fee-siple of May Fair; aud
wheu the Court went into mourning, she always wore black.
Little Rawdon being disposed of, Lord Steyne, who took such a
parental interest in the affuairs of this amiuble poor family, thought that
their expenses might be very advantageously curtailed by the departure
of Miss Briggs; and that Becky was quite clever enough to take the
mnanagement of her own house. It has been narrated in a former Chapter,
how the benevolent nobleman had given his protee money to pay off
her little debt to Miss Briggs, who however still remained behind with
hoer friends: whence my lord came to the puinful conclusion that Mrs.
Crawley hud made some other use of the money confidel to her than that
for which her generous patron had given the loan. However, ILord Steyne
was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to MIrs. Becky,
whose feelings might he hurt by any controversy on the money-question,
and who might have a thousand painful reasons for disposing oltherwise of
his lordship's generous loan. But he determined to satisfy himself of the
real state of the case: and instituted the necessary inquiries in a most
cautious and delicate manner.
In the first place he took an early opportunity of pumping Miss Bnggs.
That was not a difficult operution. A very little encouragement would
set that worthy woman to talk volubly, and pour out all within her. And
one day when Mrs. Rawdon had gone out to drive (ans Mr. Fiche, his
lordship's confidential servant, easily learned at the livery stables where the
Crawleys kept their carriage and horses, or rather, where the livery-man
kept n carriage and horses for Mr. and Mrs. Crawley)-my lord droppel
in upon the Curzon Street house-asked Briggs for a cnp of coffee-told
her that he had good accounts of the little boy nt school-and in fie
minutes found out from her that Mrs. Rawdon had given her nothing
except a black silk gown, for which Miss Briggs was immensely grateful.
Ile laughed within himself at this artless story. For the truth is, our
dear friend Rebecca had given him a most circumstantial narration of
Briggs's delight at receiving her money-eleven hundred and twety-five
pounds-and in what securities she had invested it: and what a pang
Becky herself felt in being obliged to pey aay such a delightful sum
of money.  Who knows,'' the dear woman may have thought within
A N0VEL WIIIIOUT A HERO.
469
herself, "`perhaps he may give me a little more'' My lord, however,
made no such proposal to the little schemer-very likely thinking that he
had beecn sufficiently generous alredy.
He had the curiosity, then, to ask Miss Briggs about the state of
her private affairs-nand she told his lordship cnndidly what her position
was-how Miss Crawley had left her a legacy-how her relatives hmad had
pnrt of it-how Colonel Crawley had put out another portion, for whieh
she had the best security and interest-and how Mr, and Mrs. Hnwdon
hnad kindly busied themselves with ir Pitt, who was to dispose of the
remainder most advantageously for her, when he hnd time. My lorl
asked how much the Colonel lad already invested for her, and Miss Briggs
at once and truly told him that the sum was six hundred and odd pounds.
But as soon as she had told her story, the voluble Briggs repented ol
her frankness, and besought my lord not to tell Mr. Crawley of the con-
fessions which she had made.  The Colonel was so kind-Mr. Crawley
might be offended and pay back the money, for which she could get no
such good interest anywhere else.'' Lord Steyne, laughing, promised he
never would divulge their couversation, and when he and Miss Briggs
partel he laughed still more.
What an accomplished little leil it isl' thought he. eWHat a
splendid aetress nnd managerl She hnd almost got a seeond supply out
of me the other day, with her coaxing ways. She hents all the women I
have ever seen in the course of all my well-spent life. They are babics
comparel to her. I am a grcen-horn myself, and n fool in her hnnds-an
old fool. She is unsurpassable in lies.'' His lordship's ndmiration for
Becky rose immeasurably at this proof of her cleverness. Getting the
money was nothing-but getting double the sum she wanted, and
paying nobody-it was a magnificent stroke. And Crawley, my lord
thought-Crawley is not such a fool ans he looks mnd seems. ke has
managed the matter cleverly enough on his side. Nohody would evcr
have supposed from his face and demennour that he knew anything nbout
this money business ; nnd yet he put her nn to it, and has spent the money,
no doubt. In this opinion my lord, wc know, was mistaken; hut it
influenced n good dcal his behaviour towanrds Colonel Craley, whom he
began to trent withi even less than that semblance of respect which he hnd
formerly shown towvards that gentleman. It never entered into the head
of Mrs. Crawley's patron tht the little lady might he making a purse for
herself; and, perhaps, if the truth must be told, he judged of Colonel
Crawley bhy his experience of other husbands, whom he hud known in the
course of the long and well-spent life, which had made him acquinted
with a grent del of the weakness of mankind. My lord hal bought so
mnny men during his life, thut he was surely to be pardoued for supposing
that he had found the price of this one.
He taxed Becky upon the point on the very first occnsion when he mel
her alone, and he complireted her, good-humouredly, on her eleverness
iu geting more than the mouey which she required. RBecky was only
n little taken ahack. It was not the habit of this denr crenture to tell
falschoods, except when necessity compelled, but in these great emergen-
cies it was her practice to lie very freely; and in an instnt she was ready

with another neat plausible circumstantial story which she administered
to her patron. The previous statement which she hnd made to him was a
falsehood-a wicked falsehood : she owned it ; but who had made her tell it?
 Ah, my Lord,'' she said, `'you don't know all I have to suffer and bear in
silence: you see me gay and happy before you-you little know what I have
to endure when there is no protector near me. It was my husbaud, by
threats and the most saage treatment, forced me to ask for that sum
about which I deceived you. It was he, wlo, foreseeing that questions
might be asked regarding the disposal of the money, forced me to aeeount
for it as I did. He took the money. He told me he had paid Miss
Briggs; I did not wvant, Idid not dare to doubt him. Pardon the wrong
which a desperate man is forced to commit, and pity a miserable, miserable
woman.'' She burst into tears as she spoke. Persecuted virtue neer
looked more bewitchingly wretched.
They had a long conersntion, driving round and round the Regent's
Pnrk in Mrs. Crawley's carriage together, a conversation of which it is
not necessary to repeat the details: but the upshot of it was, that, when
Becky came home, she flew to her dear Briggs with a smiling face, and
nnnounced that she had some very good news for her. Lord Steyne had
acted in thenoblest und most generous manner. He was always thinking
how and when he could do good. Now that little Rawdon was gone to
selool, a dear companion and friend was no longer neeessary to her. She
was grieved beyond measure to part with Briggs; but her means required
thnt she should practise every retrenchment, and her sorrow was mitigated
by the idea that her dear Briggs would be far better provided for by her
generous pntron than in her humble home. Mrs. Pilkington, the house-
keeper at Gauntly Hall, was growing exceedingly old, feeble, and rheu-
matic: she was not equnl to the work of superintending that vast mansion,
and must bc on the look out for a successor. It was a splendid position.
The family did not go to Gauntly once in two yeurs. At other times the
housekeeper was the mistress of the maguificent mansion-had four oovers
laily for her table; was visited by the clergy and the most respectable
people of the county-was the laly of Gauntly, in fact; and the two last
housekeepers efore Mrs. Pilkington had married rectors of Gauntly: but
Mrs. P. could not, being the aunt of the present lector. The place was
not to be hers yet; but she might go down on a visit to Mrs. Pilkington,
nnd see whether she would like to succeed her.
What words can paint the extatic gratitude of Briggsl All she stipu-
lated for was that little Rawdon should be allowed to come down and see
hcr at the lIall. Brcky proised this-any thing. She ran up to her
husband when ha came home, aund told him the joyful news. Rawdon
was glad, deuced glad; the weight was off his conscience about poor
Briggs's money. She was provided for, at any rate, but-but his mind
was disquiet. 1Ie did not seem to be all right somehow. Ie told little
Southdown what Lord Steyne had done, and the young man eyed Crawley
with an air which surprised the latter,
He told Lady Jane of this second proof of Steyne's bounty, and she,
too, looked odd and alarmed ; sa did Sir Pitt. `` She is too clever and--
and gay to be allowed to go from party to party without a eompanion,'

471
both said.  YTou must go with ler, Rawdon, whereer she goes, and you
ust have somebody with her-one of the girls from ueen's Crawley,
perhaps, though they were rather giddy guardians for her,''
Someboly Becky should have. But in the meanwhile it was elear that
honest Briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life; and so she
nnd her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey. And so two
of Rawdon's out-sentinels were in the hands of the enemy.
Sir Pitt went and expostulated with his sister-in-law upon the subject
of the dismissl of lBriggs, and other matters of delicate family interest.
In vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the protection of Lord
Steyne for her poor husband; how cruel it would be on their part to
deprive Briggs of the position offered to her. Cajolements, coaxings,
smiles, tears could not satisfy ir Pitt, and he had something very like a
qunrrel with his once admired Beeky. Hc spoke of the honour of the
family : the usullied reputation of the Crawleys; expressed himself in
indignant tones about er receiving those young Frenchmen-those wild
young men of fashion, my Lord Steyne himself, whose carriage was always
nt her door, who passed hours daily in her company, and whose constant
presence made the world talk about her. As the head of the house he im-
plored her to be more prudent. Society was already speaking lightly of her.
Lord Steyne, though a nobleman of the greatest station and talents, was a
man whose attentions would compromise any woman; he besought, he
implored, he ceommanded his sister-in-law to be watchful in her intercourse
with that nobleman.
Becky proised anytling and everything Pitt wanted ; but Lord Steyne
cnme to her house as often as ever, and Bir Pitt's anger increased. I
wonder was Lady Jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found
fault with his favourite lebeccnf Lord Steyne's visits continuing, his
own ceased; nnd his wife was for refusing all further intercourse with that
nobleman, and leclining the invitation to the Charade-night which tho
Marchioness sent to her; but Sir Pitt thought it was necessary to accept
it, as his Royal Highness would be there.
Although he went to the party in question, Sir Pitt quitted it very
early, and his wife, too, was very glad to come away. lecky hardly so
much as spoke to him or noticed her sister-in-law. Pitt Crawley declared
her behaviour was monstrously indecorous, reprobated in strong terms the
habit of play-acting and fancy dressing, as highly unbecoming a 3ritish
female; and aftcr the charades were over, took his brother Rawdon
severely to task for appeoring himself, and allowing his wife to join in
such improper exhibitions.
Rawdon said she should not join in any more such amusements, but
indecd, and perhaps from hints Irom his elder brother nnd sister, he
had already become na very watchful and exemplary domestic churacter,
He left of his clubs and billiards. He never left home. He took Becky
out to drive: he went laboriously with her to all her parties. Whenever my
Lord Steyne called, he was sure to find the Colonel. And when Becky
proposed to go out without her husband, or received invitations for her-
sclf, he perenptorily ordered her to refuse them; and there wns that in
the gentleman's manner which enforced obedicnce. Little Becky, to do

her justice, was charmed with Rawdon's gallantry. If he was surly,
she never was. Whether friends were present or absent, she had always
a kind smile for him, and was attentive to his pleasure and comfort. It
was the early days of their marriage oer again: the same good humour,
precenances, merriment, and artless confidence and regard.  How much
pleasanter, it is,'' she wonld say, ``to hae you by my side in the carriagc
than that foolish old Briggsl Let us always go on so, dear Rawdon.
How nice it would be, and how happy we should always be, if we had
but the moneyl'' He fell asleep after dinner in his chair; he did not see
the face opposite to him, hggard, weary, and terrible; it lighted up with
fresh candid smiles when he woke. It kissed him gaily. He wondered
that he had ever had suspicions. No, he never had suspicion; all those
dumb doubts and surly misgivings which had been guthering on his mind
were mere idle jealousies. She was fond of lim; she always had been.
As for her shining in society it was no fault of heres; she ws formed to
shine there. Was there any woman who could talk, or sing, or do
anythiug like herP If she would but like the boyl klawdon thought.
But the mother and son never could be brought together.
And it was while Rawdon's mind was agitated with these doubts and per-
plexities that the incident occurred which was mentioned in the last
Chapter; and the unfortunate Colonel found himself a prisoner away from
home.

drove on then to
Mr. Moss's mnn-

duly inducted into
that dismal place of

and n little pink-

as the rising morn
let the party inta
the house, and Rawdon was weleomed to the ground-floor apartments
by Mr. Moss, his travelling companion and host, who cheerfully asked him
if he would like a glass of something warm after his drive.
The Colonel was not so depressed as some mortals would be, who,
quitting a palace and a placens uxor, find themselves barred into a
spunging-house, for, if the truth must be told, he had bcen a lodger at
Mr. Moss's establishment once or twice before. We have not thought it
necessary in the previous course of this nnrrative to mention these trivial
little domestio incidents : but the realer may be assured that they can't
unfrequently occur in the life of a man who lives on nothing a-year.
Upon his first visit to Mr. Moss, the Colonel, then a bachelor, had
been liberated by the generosity of his Aunt; on the second mishap, little
Becky, with the greatest spirit and kindness, had borrowed n sum of
money from Lord Southdown, and had coaxed her husband's creditor
(who was her hawl, velvet-gown, lsce pocket-handkerchief, trinket, and
gim-crack purveyor, indeed) to take a portion of the sum claimed, and
Rawdon's promissory note for the remainder: so on both these occasions
the capture and release had been conducted with the utmost gallantry on
all sides, and Moss and the Colonel were therefore on the very best of
terms,
4I4

 ou'll find your ol bed, Colonel, and everything comfortable,'' that
gentleman sail, ``as I may honestly say. ou may be pretty sure its kep
nuired, and by the best of company, too. It was slep in tho night afore
laat hy the IIonorable Captiug lFamish, of the Fiftieth Dragoons, whose
MIar took him out, after a fortnight, jest to punish him, she said. But,
Law bless you, I promise you, he punished my champagne, and had a party
ere every night-reglar tip-top swells, dow from the clubs and the West
Eul-Capting Ragg, the Honorable Deuceace, who lives in the Temple,
and some fellers ns knows a good glass of wine, I warrant you. I've got
a Doctor of Diwinity up stairs, fie gents in the Coffee-room, and
MIrs. Moss has a tably-dy-hoty at half-past five, and a little cards or
music afterwards, when we shall be most happy to see you.''
I'I1 ring, when I want anything,'' said Rawdon, and went quietly to
his bel-room. lle was nn old soldier, we have said, and not to be dis-
turbed by any little shocks of fate. A wenker man would have sent off
n letter to his wife on the instant of his capture. t` But what is the use
of disturbing her night's rest ?'' thought Rawdon. `` She won't know
whcther I am in my room or not. It will be time enough to write to her
when she has had her sleep out, and I have had mine. It's onlya
hundred-and-seveuty, and the deuce is in it if we cau't raise that,''
And so, thiuking about little Rawdon (whom he would not like to
kuow that he was in such a queer place), the Colonel turned into the
bcd lately occupied by Captain Famish, and fell asleep. It was
ten o'clock when he woke up, nnd the ruddy-headed youth brought
him, with conscious pride, a fine silver dressing-case, wherewith he might
perform the operation of shaving. Indeed Mr. Moss's ouse, though
somewhat dirty, was splendid throughout. There were dirty trays, and
wine-coolers en permanence on the side-board, hnge dirty gilt cornices,
with dingy yellow satin hangings to the barred windows which looked
into Cursitor Street-vastand dirty gilt picture-frames surrounding pieces
sporting and sacred, all of which works were by the greatest masters; and
fetchel the greatest prices, too, in the bill transactions, in the course of
which they were sold and bought over and over again. The Colonel'e
brenkfnst was sered to him in the snme dingy and gorgeous plated ware.
Miss Moss, a dark-eyed maid in curl papers, appeared with the teapot,
nnd, smiling, asked the Colonel how he lad slep and she brought him in
the Morning Post, with the names of all the great people who had figured
at ILord Steyne's entertainment the night before. It contained a brilliant
accouut of the festivities, and of the beautiful and accomplished Mrs.
Rawdon Crawley's admirable personifications.
After a lively chat with this lady (who sate on the edge of the break-
fast table in an easy attitude displaying the drapery of her stoeking an an
ex-white satin shoe, which was down at heel), Colonel Crawley cnlled for
pens and ink, and paper; and being asked how many sheets, chose one
which was brought to him between Miss Moss's own finger and thuml.
MIany a sheet had that dark-eyed damsel brought in; many a poor fellow
had scrawled nnd blotted hurried lines of entreaty, and paced up and
down that awful room until his messenger brouglt back the reply. Poor
men always use messengers instead of the post. Who has not had their

in the hsll:
Now on the score of his applicntion, awdon had not many misgivings.
 Dear Becky,'' llawdon wrote, " I lope yo aslept well. Don't be

 P,S. Make haste and come.''
R. C.
This letter, sealed with a wafer, was dispatched by one of the messengers
who are always hauging about Mr. Moss's estublishment; and llawdon,
having seen him depart, went out in the court-yard, and smoked his cigar
with a tolerably easy nind-in spite of the burs over hend; fur Mr. Moss's
court-yard is railed in like a cage, lest the gentlemen who are boarding
with him should take a fancy to escape from his hospitulity.
Three hours, he calculated, would be the utmost time required, beforc
Beocky should narrive and open his prison doors: and he passed these pretty
cheerfully in smoking, in reading the paper, and in the Coffee-room with
an acquaintance, Captain Wulker, who happened to be there, and with
whom he cut for sixpences for some hours, with pretty cqual luck on
either side.
But the day passed away nnd no messenger returned,-no RBecky.
Mr. Moss's tably-de-hoty was served at the appointed hour of hall-past five,
when such of the gentlemen lodging in the house as could nfford to pay
for the banquet, came nnd partook of it in the splendid front parlounr
before described, and with which Mr. Crnwley's temporary lolging cm-
municated, when Miae M., (Miss Hem, as her papa called her,) npparel
without tle curl-papers of the morning, and Mre, Hem did the honours
of a prime boiled leg of mutton and turnips, of which thie Colonel ate
with a very faint appetite. Asked whether he would ``stanl'' n bottle ol
champagne for the company, he consented, anl thc ladies drank to his
'ealth, and Mr, Moss, in the most polite manner ``looked towurls
him.''
In the midst of tlis repnust howevcr, the door-bell was heard,-youug

Moses of the ruddy hair, rose up with the keys and answered the summons,
nnd coming back, told the Colonel that the messenger had returned with
n bag, a desk and a letter, which he gave him. `` No ceramony, Colonel,
1 beg,'' said Mrs. Mloss with a wave of her hand, and he opened the leter
rather tremulously.-It was a beautiful letter, highly scented, on a pink
paper, and with a light green seal.
:Mo paure cler petit,'' (Mr. Crawley wrote). :` I conuld not sleep one
wink for thiukiug of what had become of my odious old moastre: and only
got to rest in the morning after sending for Mr. Bleuch (for I was ina
fever), who gnve me a composing draught and left orders with Finette that
I should be disturbed on no aceount. So that my poor old man's mes-
senger, who had ien nauaise ine Finette says, and sentoit le Gexieore,
remained in the hall for some hours waiting my bell. ou may fancy my
state when I read your poor dear old ill-spelt letter.
 Ill as I was, I instantly called for the carriage, and as soon as I was
dressed (though I couldn't drink a drop of chocolate-I assure you I
couldn't without my nonstre to bring it to me), I drove ceutre a terre to
Nuthan's. lI saw him-I wept-lI criel--I fell at his odious knees.
Nothing wonld mollify the horrid man. He would have all the money, he
said, or keep my poor monstre in prison. lI drove lome with the inten-
tion of paying thut triste isite clez mon onecle, (when every trinket I hae
should be at your disposnl though they would not fetch a hundred pounds
for some, you know, are with ce cler oncle already,) nnd found Milor there
with the Bulgarian old sheep-lfaced monster, who had come to complient
me upon last night's performances. Puddington came in, too, drswling
and lisping and twiddling his hair; so did Champiguae, and his chef-
everybody with foison of compliments and pretty speeches-plaguing pot
me, who longed to be rid of them, aud was tlinking every motent of tke
time of mon paure prisounier.
When they were gone, I went down on my knees to Milor; told him
we were going to pawn cverything, and begged and prayed him to gie me
two hundred pounds. He pish'd and psha'd in a fury-told me not to be
such a fool as to pawn-and said he would see whethier he could leud me
the money. At last he went away, promising that he would send it me
in the morning: when I will bring it to my poor old monster with a kiss

When Rawdon read over this letter, he turned so red and looked so
saage, that the company at the table d'hote easily perceived thut bad news
had reached him. All his suspicions, which he had been trying to banisb,
returned upon him. She could not even go out and sell her trinkets te
free him. She could laugh and talk about compliments paid to her, whilst
he was in prison. Who had put him there Wenham had walked with
him. Was there.
. He eould hardly bear to think of what he
suspeeted. Leaving the room hurriedly, he ran into his ow-opened his
desk, wrote two hurried lines, which he directed to Sir Pitt or Lsdy
Crawley, and bade the messenger carry them at once to Gaunt Street,

bidding him to take a cab, and promising him a guinea if he was back in
an hour.
In the note he besought his dear brother and sister, for the sake of God;
for the sake of his dear child and his honour:; to come to him and relieve
him from his difficulty. He was in prison : he wantel a hundred pounds
to set him free-he entreated them to come to him.
He went back to the dining-room after dispatching his messenger, and
called for more wine. He laughed and talked with a strange boisterous-
ness, as the people thought. Sometimes he lsughed madly at his own
fears, and went on drinking for an hour; listening all the while for the
carrisge which was to bring his fate baek.
At the expiration of that time, wheels were heard whirling up to tkc gste
-the young Janitor went out with his gate-keys. It was a lsdy whom
he let in at the bailiff's door.

eeColonel COrawley,'' she said, trembling very much. He, with a know-
ing look, loeked the outer door upon her-then unlocked and opened the
iuner one, and calling out, Colonel, you're wanted,'' led her into the
back parlour, which he occupied.
Rawdon came in from the dining-parlour where all those people were
carousing, into his back room ; a flare of coarse light following him into the
apartment where the lady stood, still very nervous.
4T8
VAMITY FAIR.
 It is I, Rawdon,'' she said, in a timid oice, which she stroe to
render cheerful. ``It is Jane.'' Rawdon was quite overcome by that
kind voice and presenee. He ran p to her-caught her in his arms-
gasped out some inarticulate words of thanks, and fairly sobbed on her
shoulder. She did not know the cause of his emotion.
The bills of Mr. Moss were quickly settled, perhaps to the dissppoint-
ment of that gentleman, who hd counted on having the Colonel as his
guest over Sunday at least; asnd Jane, with beaming smiles and happi-
ness in her eyes, carried away Rawdon from the bailiff's house, and
they went homewurds in the cab in which she had hastened to his
releuse. ``Pitt was gone to a parliamentary dinner,'' she said, ``when
Rawdon's note came, and so, dear Rawdon, I-I came myself;'' and she
put her kind hand in his. Perhaps it was well for Rawdon Crawley that
Pitt was awuy at that dinner. Rawdon thanked his sister a hundred
times, and with an ardour of zratitude which touched and almost alarmed
that soft-hearted woman.  Oh,'' said he, in his rude, artless way, ``ou
you don't know how I'm changed since I've known you, and-and little
Rawdy. I-I'd like to change somehow. Iou see I want-lI want-t
be-.''--He did not finish the sentence, but she could interpret it. And
that night after he left her, and as she sate by her own little boy's bed,
she prayed humbly for that poor wayworn sinner.
Rawdon left her and wulked home rapidly. It was nine oclock at
night. He ran across the streets, and the great squares of Vanity Fair,
and at length csme up breathless opposite his own house. He started
back and fell against the railings, trembling as he looked up. The drawing-
room windows were blazing with light. She had said thnt she was in bed
and ill. He stood there for some time, the light from the rooms on his
ple fuce.
He took out his door-key and let himself into the house. He could
lear laughter in the upper rooms. He was in the ball-dress in which he
had been captured the night before. He went silently up the stairs;
leaning agninst the bannisters at the stair-head.-Nobody was stirring i
the house besides-all the servants had been sent away. Ruwdon heard
lauglter within-laughter and singing. Becky was singing a snatch of
the song of the night before; a hoarse voice shouted `Brava, Brara;''
-it was Lord Steyne's.
Rawon opened the door and went in. A little table with a dinner was
Iaid out-and wine and plate. Steyne was hanging over the sofa on
whieh Becky ste. The wretched woman was in na brilliant full toilette, her
arms and all her fingers sparkding with bracelets and rings ;, and the brilliants
on her breast which Steyne had given her. He had her hand in his, and
was bowing over it to kiss it, when Becky started up with a faint screso
as she caught sight of Rawdon's white face. At the next instant she tried
a smile, a horrid smile, as if to welcome her husband: and Steyne rose u
grinding his teeth, pale, and with fury in his looks.
He, too, attempted a luugh-and came forward lolding out his hand.
What, come backl How d'ye do, Crawley '' he said, the nerves of Mi
mouth twitching as he tried to grin at the intruder.
A NOYL WITIIOUT A HLEBO.
479
There was that in Rawdon's face which causel Becky to fling hcrself
efore him. ``I am innocent, Rawdon,'' she said;  before God, I nm
innocent.'' She clung hold of his cout, of his hnuds; her own were all
covered with serpents, and rings, and bnubles. ``I am innocent.-iay I
am innocent,'' she said to Lord Steyne.
He thought a trap had been laid for him, and was as furious with the
wife as with the husband.  You innoeentl Dnn you,'' e sereamed
out. ` You innoeentl Why every trinket you have on your body is paid
for by me. I have given you thousands of pounds which this fellow has
pent, aud for which he has sold you. Innocent, by-1 ou're as
innocent as your mother, the ballet-girl, and your husband the bully.
Don't think to frighten me as you hve done others. Make way, sir,
and let me pss;'' and Lord Steyne scized up his hat, and, with flame in
his eyes, and looking his enemy fiercely in the face, nrched upon him,
neer for a moment doubting that the other would give way.
But Rawdon Crawley springing out, seized him by the neck-cloth, until
Steyne, almost strangled, writhed, and bent under his arm. ` You lie, you
dog l'' said Rewdon. ``ou lie, you coward nnd villain'' And he struck
the Peer twice over the face with his open hand, and flung him bleeding to
the ground. It was all done before Rebecca could interpose. She stood
there trembling before him. She admired her husband, strong, brave, and
victorious.
Come here,'' he said.-Bhe came up at once.
Take off those things.''-She began, trembling, pulling the jewels
from her arms, and the rings from her shaking fingers, and eld them all in
a heap, quivering and lookiug up at him.  Throw them down,'' he said,
and she dropped them. He tore the diamond ornament out of her breast,
and flung it at Lord Steyne. It cut him on his bald forehead. Steyne
wore the scar to his dying day.
 Come up stairs,'' Rawdon said to his wife. :Don't kill me,
Rawdon,'' she said. He laughed savagely.-' I want to see if that man
lies aout the money as he has about me. Has he given you any P''
 No,'' snid Rebecec, ``that is-''
 Give me your keys,'' Rawdon answered, and they went out together.
Rebecca gave him all the keys but one: and she was in hopes that he
would not have remarked the absence of that. It bhelonged to the little
ldesk which Amelia had givcn ler in early days, and which she kept in a
secret place. But Rawdon flung open boxes and wardrobes, throwing the
multifarious trumpery of their contents here and there, and at last he
found the desk. The woman wus forced to open it. It contained papers,
love-letters many years old- all sorts of small trinkets and woman's
memoranda. And it contained a pocket-book with bank notes. Some
of these were dated ten years back, too, and one was quite a fresh one
-a note for a thousand pounds which Lord Steyne had given her.
 Did he give you this ?'' Rawdon said.
e Yes;'' Rebecea answered.
I 'Il send it to him to-dsy,'' Rawdon said (for day had dawned again,
and many hours had passed in this search), ``'and I will pay Briggs, who

pounds, Becky, out of all this-I have alwuays shared with yonu.''
``I am innocent,'' suaid Becky. And he left her without another word.
What were her thoughts when he left her? She remained for hours
nfter he was gone, the sunshine pouring into the room, and Rebeccea sitting
nlone on the bed's elge. The drawers were all opened and their contents
scnttered about,-dresses and feathers, scarfs and trinkets, a heap ol
tumbled vanities lying in a wreck. Her hair was fulling over her shoulders;
her gown was torn where Rawdon had wrenched the brilliants out of it. She
henard him go down stairs a few minutes after he left her, and the door
slamming and closing on him. She knew he would never come back. He
was gone for ever. Would he kill himself-she thought-not until after
he had met Lord Steyne. She thought of her long past life, and all the
dismal incidents of it. Ah, how dreary it seemed, how miserable, lonely
and profitlessl Should she take laudanum, and end it, too-have done
with all hopes, schemes, debts, and triumphs The French muid
found her in this position-sitting in the midst of her miserable ruins
with clasped hands and dry eyes. The woman was her accomplice and in
Steyne's pay. `` Mon Dieu, Madame, wat has happened?'' she asked.
What lad happened Was she guilty or notP She said not; but wha
could tell what was truth which came from those lips; or if that corrupt
heart wns in this case pureP All her lies and er schemes, all her selfish-
ncss and her wiles, all her wit and genius had come to this bankruptcy.
The woman closed the curtains, and with some entreaty and show of
kindness, persunded her mistress to lie down on the bed. Then she went
below and gathered up the trinkets which had been lying on the floor sinee
Rebecca dropped them there at her husband's orlers, and Lord Steyne
went away.

HE mansion of Sir Pitt Crawley
in Great Gaunt Street, was just
beginning to dress itself for the
day, as lnwdon, in his evening
costume, which he had now
worn to duays, passed by the
scared female who was scouring
the steps, and entered into his
brother's study. ady Jane in
her morning-gown, was up and
nbove stairs in the nursery,
superintending the toilettes of
her children, and listening to
the morning prayers which the
little ereatures pcrformed at her
knee. Every morning she and
they performel this duty pn-
vately, and before the public
ceremonial at which Bir Pitt
presidel, nd at which all the
people of the household were
expected to assemble. Rawdon
sate down in the study before
the baronet's table, set out with the orderly blue books and the letters,
the neatly docketted bills and symmetrical pamphlets; the loeked account-
books, desks, and dispatch boxes, the Bible, the Quarterly Reeieo, and
the Court Guide, which all stood as if on parade awaiting the inspection
of their chief.
A book of family sermons, one of which Sir Pitt was in the habit of
alministering to his family on Sundasy mornings, lay ready on tle study
table, and awaiting his judicious selection. And by the sermon-book
was the Oeerer newspaper, damp and neatly folded, and for Sir Pitt's
own private use. IHis gentleman alone took the opportunity of perusing
the newspaper before he laid it by his master's desk. Before he hnd
rought it into the study that morning, he had rend in the journal a
flaming account of `' Festivities at Gaunt Iousc,'' with the names of nll the
distinguished personages iuvited by the Marquis of Steyne to meet his Roynl
Hlighness. IIavringmadeeomments upon this entertainme tc the lcuee-

keepar and her niecee as they were taking early tea and hot-buttered toast
in the former lady's apartment, and wondered how the Rawding Crawleys
oould git on, the alet had damped and folded the paper onee more, so
that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the arrival of the master of
the house.
Poor Rawdon toeok up the paper and began to try and real it until his
brother should arrive. But the print fell blank upon his eyes; and he did
not know in the least what he was reading. Tha Government news and
nppointments, (which Sir Pitt as  public man was bound to peruse, other-
wise he would by no means permit the introduetion of Sunday papers into
his household), the theatrical criticisms, the fight for a hundred pounds
a-side between the RBarking Butcler and the Tutbury Pet, the Gaunt
IIouse chronicle itself, which contained a most complimentary though
yuarded aceount of the famous charades of wlich Mrs. Becky had been the
heroine-all these passed as in a haze before Rawdon, as he sat waiting
the arrival of the chief of the family.
Tumnctually, as the shrill-toned lell of the black marble study clock
hegan to clime nine, Sir Pitt made his appearance, fresh, neat, smugly
shavcd, with a waxy clean faee, and stilfhirt eollar, his scanty hair combed
and oiled, trimming his nails as he descended the staiss majestically, in a
starched crarat .and a gray flannel -dresjnggiwn,-a real old English
gentleman, in as word,-a model of neatness and  eery propriety. He
starded when he saw poor Rawdon in his study ia tubled clothes, with
lool-shot eyes, and his hir over his face He thought his brother was
not sober, and had been out allight on sme dgyr t Good Gracions,
awdon,'' he said, ith a blnkfte, ''wht brisg you here at this time
of the morning: Wly ain'tuei at home''
1Iome,'' sail Rawdon, with a wild lugh. `Don't be frightened,
Pitt. I 'm not drunk. Shutthe door; Iwant to speak to you.''
Pitt cloted tho door and eame up to th table, where he sate down in
the otler arm chair,--that ane placed forthbe reeeptin of the steward,
agnt, or confidential visitor who came to  transast business with the
baronet,-and trimmedL.his nails more vehemently than eer.
e Pitt, it 's ull over with me,'' theolonel said, after a pause. I'mi done,''
``I alsys ssid -it wuld come to this,' theBareet criet, peevishly,

assist you ultimately. But as for peyig yor creditors in full, I might as
well hope to pay the National Debt. It is madness, sheer madness, to
think of such a thing. on must come to a compromise. It 's a painful
thing for the family; but everybody does it. There was George Kitely,
Lord Ragland's son, went through the Court last week, and was what they
call white-washed, I beliee. Lord Ragland would not pay a shilling for
him, and--''
It 's not money I want,'' RBawdon broke in. `I 'm not come to yo
about myself. Never mind what happens to me--''

A NOVEL WITOUT A HERO.

 What is the matter, then ?'' snil Pitt, somewhat relieed.
 It's the boy,'' said Rawdon, in a husky voice.  I want you to
promise me that you will take charge of him when I'm gone. That dear
good wife of yours has always been good to him; and he's fonder of har
than he is of his. . .-Damn it. Look here, Pitt-you know that I was
to have hnd Miss Crawley's money. I wasn't brought up like a younger
brother: but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kep idle. But
for this I might hae been quite a different man. I didn't do my duty
with the regiment so bad, You know how I was thrown over nbout the
money, and who got it.''
After the saerifices I have male, and the manner in which Ilave stool
by you, I think this sort of reproach is useless,'' Sir Pitt said. `Your
marriage was your own doing, not mine.''
That 's over now,'' snid Rawlon.- That's over now.'' And the worls
were wrenched from him with a groan, which male his brother start.
Gool God l is she dead'' Sir Pitt said, with a voice of genuine alarm
and commiseration.
I wish I was,'' Rawdon replied. If it wasn 't for little Rawdon I'd
have cut my throat this morning-and that damned villain's too,''
Sir Pitt instantly guessed the truth, and surmised that Lord Steyne
wass the person whose life Rawdon wished to take. The Colonel told his
senior briefly, und in broken accents, the circumstances of the case.: It
was a regular plan between that ecoundrel and her,'' he said.  The bailifa
were put upon me: I was tuaken as I was going out of his house: when I
wrote to her for money, she said sle was ill in bed, and put me off to
another day. And when I got home I found her in diamonds and sitting
with that villain alone.'' IHe then went on to describe hurriedly the per-
sonal conflict with Lord Steyne. To an affair of that nature, of course, he
said, there was but one issue: and nafter his conferemdce with his brotler,
he was going away to make the necessary arrangements for the mceting
which must ensue. `And us it may end fatally for me,'' Rawdon said with
n broken voice, '`and as the boy has no mother, I must leave him to you
and Jane, Pitt-only it will be a comfort to me if you will promise me to
be his friend.''
The elder brother was muceh nffected, and shook Rawdon's hand with a
cordiality seldom exhibited by him. Ruawdon passed his hand over his
slaggy cyebrows. `Thank you brother,'' said he. I know I cn trust
your word.''
I will, upon my honour,'' the Bnuonet said. Andl thus, and almost
mntely, this bargin was struck between them.
Then Rawdon took out of his pocket the little pocket-book which he had
diseoered in Becky's desk: and from which he drew a bundle of the
notes which it contained. `` Here's six hundred,'' he said-``you didn't
know I was so rich. I want you to give the money to Briggs, who lent it to
us-and who was so kind to the boy-and I've nlways felt ashamed of
having taken the poor old woman's money. And here's some more-
I 've only kept back a few pounds-which ecky may as well have, to get
on with. As he spoke he took hold of the other notes to give to his
brother : but his hands shook, and he was so agitated that the pocket-book

fell from him, and out of it the thousand pound note which had been the
last of the unlucky Becky's winnings.
Pitt stooped and picked them up, omazed at so mnch wealth. ` Notthat,''
Rawdon said--`I hope to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs
to.'' He had thought to himself, it would be a fine revenge to wrap a ball
in the note, and kill Steyne with it.
MAfter this colloquy the brothers onee more slook hands and parted.
Lady Jane had heard of the Colonel's arrial, and was waiting for her
husband in the adjoining dining-room, with female instinct, auguring evil.
The door of the diuing-room happened to be left open, and the ldy of
coursc was issuing from it as the two brothers passed out of the study
She held out her land to Rawdon, and said she was glad he was come to
hreakfast ; though she could perceive, by his haggard unshorn face, and the
dark looks of her husband, that there was very little question of reakfst
between them. Rnwdon muttered some excuses about an engagement,
squeezing hard the timid little hand which his sister-in-law reached out to
him. Her imploring cyes could read nothing but calamity in lis faee:
but he went awny without another worl. Nor did Sir Pitt rouchsafe her
any explanation. The chillren eame up to salute him, and he kissed the
in his usual frigid manner. The mother took both of them close to her-
self, and hoeld a hand of eneh of them as thy knelt down to prnycrs, which
Sir Pitt rend to thcm, and to the servants in their Sunday suits or liveries,
ranged upon chairs on the othcr side of the hissing tea-uru. Breakfast
wns so lute thnt day, in consequence of the delays which had oecurred, that
the chureh-hsells begnn to ring whilst they were sitting oer their meal:
nnd Lady Jaue was too ill, she said, to go to church, though er thoughts
had been entirely astray during the periol of family deotion.
Rwdon Cruwley meanwhile hurried on from Grent Gaunt Street, and
knocking at the greast bronze Medusa's head which stands on the portal of
Gnnut lIouse, brought out the purple Silenus in a red and silver waistcoat,
who acts as porter of tlat pnlace. he man wns scared also by the Colonel's
dishevclled uppearance, and bnrred the wny as if afraid that the other was
going to force it. But Colonel Crawley only took out a card and enjoined
him particularly to scnd it in to Lorl Steyne, and to mark the address
writtcn on it, and say that Colonel Crawley would be all day after one
o'clock nt the egent Club in St. James's Street-not at home. The fat
red-faced man looked after him with astonislment as he strode away; so did
the people in their Sunday clothes who were out so early; the charity boys
with shining faces, the green-grocer lolling at his door, and the publican
shutting his shutters in the sunsline, against service commenced. The
pcople joked nt the eabstand about lis appearanee, as he took a carriage
there, and told the driver to take him to Knightsbridge Barraeks.
All the bells were jangling and tolling as he reached that place. He
might have seen his old aequaintance Amelin on her way from Brompton
to Russell Square had he been looking out. Troops of schools were on
their march to church, the shiny pavement and outsides of coaches in the
the suburbs were thronged with people out upon their Sunday pleasure;
but tue Colonel was muceh too busy to take any heed of these phenomena,
nnd, arriving at Hnightsbridge, speedily made his way up to the room ot

his old friend and comrade Captain Macmurdo, who Crawley found, to his
satisfaction, was in barracks.
Captain Maemurdo, a veteran officer and Waterloo man, greatly liked by
his regiment, in which want of money alone prevented him from attaining
the highest ranks, was enjoying the forenoon calmly in bed. He had been

at a fast supper-party, given the night before by nptain the Honourable
George Cinqbnrs, at his house in Brompton Square, to several young men
of the regiment, and a number of ladies of the corps de ballet, and old Mac,
who was at home with people of all ages and ranks, and consorted with
generals, dog-fanciers, opera-dancers, bruisers, nd every kind of person, in
n word, was resting himself after the night's labours, and, not being on
duty, was in bed.
His room was hung round with boxing, sporting, and dancing pictures,
presented to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment, and mar-
ried and settled into quiet life. And as he was now nearly fifty years of
age, twenty-four of which he hal passed in the corps, he had a singulas

museum. He was one of the best slots in England, and, for as heay man,
one of the best riders; indeed, he and Crawley had been rivals when the
latter was in the army. To be brief, Mr. MIacmurdo was lying in bed,
readiug in Bell's Iife an account of tht very fight between the Tutbury
Pet and the Barking Butcher, which has been before mentioned-a vene-
rable bristly warrior, with a little close-shaved grey head, with a silk
nightcap, a red face and nose, and a great dyed moustache.
When Rawdon told the Captain he wanted a friend, the latter knew per-
fectly well on what duty of friendship he was called to act, and inleed had
conlucted scores of nfairs for his acquaiutances with the greatest pr-
dence and skill. His Royal Highness the late lamentel Commauder-in-
Chief had had the greatest regard for Macmurdo on this aeeount; and he
was the common refuge of gentlemen in trouble.
 What's the row about, Crawley, my boy ?'' said the old wurrior.
No more gambling business, hay, like that when we shot Captain
MarkerP
It's about-about my wife,'' Crawley answered, casting down his
eyes and turning very red.
The other gave a whistle. :'I always sid she'd throw you over,'' he
began :-indeed there were bets in the regimnt and at the clubs regard-
ing the probable fuate of Colonel Crawley, so lightly was his wife's character
esteemed by his comrales and the world :-but seeing the savage look with
which Hawdon answered the expression of this opinion, acmurdo did not
think fit to enlarge unpon it farther.
 Is there no way out of it, old hoy P'' the Captain continued in a grae
tone. '`Is it only uspicion, you know, or-or what is it Any letters'
Caun't you keep it quiet? Best not make any noise about a thing of that
sort if you can help it,''  Thiuk of his only finding her out nown,'' the
Captain thought to himself, and remembered a hundrel particular convcr-
sations at the mese-table, in which Mrs. Crawley's reputation had been
torn to shreds.
 There's no way but one out of it,'' Rawlon replied-`and there's ouly
a way out of it for one of us, Mao-do you understanl? I was put out
of the way: arrested : I found 'em alone together. I told him he wasa
liar nnd a coward, and knocked him down and thrashed him.''
`Serve him right,'' Macmurdo sid.  Who is it'
Rawdon answered it was Lord Steyne.
eThe deucel a Marquisl they said he-that is, they snid you --'

 It was damned unfriendly, Mac,'' said Rawdon, quite oereome; anl,
covering his face wvith his hnds, he gave way to an cemotion, the sight of
which caused the tough old capaigner opposite him to winee with
sympathy. 'Hold up, old boy,'' he suid; ``grt an or not, we 'll pul
n bullet in lim, dnmn him. As for women, they 're all so.''
You don't know how fond I was of that one,'' Rawdon said, half

inarticulately.  Damme, I followed her like a footman. I guve up evcry-
thing I had to her. I'm a beggar because I would marry her. By Jove,
Bir, I've pawned my own watch in order to get her anything she fancied,
and sle-she's beeu making n purse for herself all the time, and grulgel
me a hundred pound to get me out of quol.'' Ie then fiercely and inco-
herently, nnd withi nn agitation under which his counsellor hd evcr
before seen him labour, told Maemurdo the cireumstances of the story.
His adviscr cught at some stray hints in it.
eShe may be innocent, after all,'' he ssid. She says so. Steyne has
been a hundred times ulone with her in the house before,''
It may be so,'' Rawdon answered, sadly : `` but this lon't look very
innocent :'' and he showed the Captain the thousand pound note which he
had found in Beeky's pocket-ook.  This is what he gave her, Mae:
and shce kep it unknown to me: and with this money in tho house, she
refused to stand by me when I was locked up.'' The Cnptsin could not
but own that the secreting of the moncy had a very ugly look.
Whilst they were engaged in their conference, Rawdon dispatched
Captain Mnemurlo's servant to Curzon Street, with an order to the
domestic there to give up a bag of clothes of which the Colonel had great
neel. Anl during the man's absenee, and with gret labour and a
Johnson's Dictionnry, which stood them iu much stead, Rawdon and his
second oomposed a letter, which the latter was to send to Lord Steyne.
Cptain Maemurdo had the honour of waiting upon the Marquis of
Steyne, on the part of Colonel Rawsdon Crawley, and begged to intimate
that he was empowered by the Colonel to mke any arrangements for the
meeting which, he had no doubt, it was his Lordship's intention ta
demand, and which the circumstances of the orning had rendered
inevitable. Captain Maemurdo begged Lord Steyne, in the most polite
manner, to appoint a friend, with whom he (Captain M`ML.) might com-
municate, and desired thuat the meeting might take place with as little
delay as possible.
In a postscript the Captain stated that he had in his nossession a bank-
uote for a large amount, which Colonel Crawley had reason to suppos
was the property of the Marquis of Steyne. And he was anxious, on the
Colonel's behalf, to give up the note to its owner.
By the time this note was composed, the Captain's servant returnel
from his mission to Colonel Crawley's house in Curzon Street, but without
the cnrpet-bag and portmanteau, for wlich he hd been sent: and with a
very puzled anl odd face.
They won't a give 'em up,'' said the man; ``there's a regular slinty
in the house; and everything at sixes and sevens. The landlord's come
in and took possession. The servnnts was a drinkin up in the lrawing-
room. `They said-they saidl you had a gone off with thic plate, Colonel''
-the man added after a pause :--`One of the servnuts is off already.
And Simpson, the man us was very noisy and drunk iudeed, says nothing
ahall go out of the house until his wages is paid up.''
The account of this little revolution in Muy Fair astonishecd and gave a
little gaiety to an otherwise very triste conversation. The two officers
laughed at Rawdon's discomfiture.

I'm glad the little 'un isn't at home,'' Rawdon said, biting his nsils.
 You remember him, Mac, don't you, in the Riding SchoolP How he sat
the kicker to be surel didn't heP''
That he did, old boy,'' said the good-natured Captain.
Little Rawlon was then sitting, one of fifty gown-boys, in the Chapel of
WVhitefriars School : thinking, not about the sermon, but about going home
next Saturday, wlen his father would certainly tip him, and perhsps would
take him to the play.
Ie's a regular trump, that boy,'' the father went on, still musing
about his son. `` I say, Mae, if anything goes wrong-if I drop-I should
like you to-to go and see him, you know: and say that I was very fond
of him, and that. And-dash it-old chap, gie him these gold sleee-
buttons : it's all I've got. Ie coverel his face with his black hands:
over which the tenrs rollcd and mnde furrows of white. Mr. Macmurdo
had nlso occasion to take off his silk night-cap and rub it across his eyes.
Go down and order some breakfast,'' he said to his man in a loud
cheerful voice,-- WIat 'Il you have, Crawley Some devilled kidnes
and a herring-let's sny-Ad, Clay, lay out some ressing things for
the Colonel: we were always pretty much of a size, Rawdon, my boy, and
neither of us ride so light as we did when we first entered the corps.''
With which, and leaving the Colonel to dress himself, Maemurdo turned
round towards the wall, and resumed the perusal of ell'e Life, until such
time as his friend's toilette was complete, and he was at liberty to com-
mienee his own.
Ihis, as he was ahout to meet a Lord, Captain Macmurdo performed
with particular cnre. IIe waxed his mustaclios into a state of brilliant
polish, and put on a tight craat and a trim buff waistcoat : so that all
the young officers in the mess-room, whither Crawley had precedel his
friend, complimented Mac on his appearance at breakfast, and asked if he
was going to be married that Sundasy?

-no, not though her mistress,
in a great pet, and with the

out to the landing-place with her hair oer her shoulders, and screamed out
repeatedly for her attendunt.
The truth is, she had quitted the premises for many hours, and upon
that permission which is cnlled French leave among us. After picking up
the trinkets in the drawing-room, Mademoiselle hnd ascended to her own
apartments, packed nnd corded her own boxes there, tripped out and
callel a cuab for herself, brought down her trunks with her own hand, and
without ever so much ns asking the nid of any of the other servants, who

Fifine went off in a cab, as we have known more exaltel persons of her

gold enamelled snuff-box which hal once belonged to Madame du Barri,
anl the swcetest little inkstand and mother-of-pearl blotting-book, which
Becky used when she composed her chnrming little pink notes, had vanished
from the premises in Curzon Street together with Mademoiselle Fifine, and
all the silver laid on the table for the little festin which Rawdon interrupted.
The plated ware Mademoiselle left behind her ns too cumbrous probably,
for which renson, no doubt, she also left the fire irons, the chimney-glassces,
and the rosewood cottage piano.
A lady very like her subsequently kept a milliner's shop in the Rue du
Helder nt Puris, where she livel ith grent credit and enjoyed the patron-
age of my Lord Steyne. This person alwsays spoke of England as of the
most treacherous country in the world, and stated to her young pupils
that she had been afresement sole' by natives of that island. It was no
doubt compassion for her misfortunes which induced the Marquis of Steyne
to be so ery kind to Madame de Saint Amaranthe. Mny she flourish as
she deserves,-she appears no more in our quarter of Vnnity Fair.
Hearing a buzz and a stir below, and indignant at the impudence of
those servants who wonuld not answer her summons, Mrs. Crawley flung
her morning robe round her, and descenuded majestically to the drawing-
room, whence the noise proceeded.
The cook was there with blackened face, seated on the beantiful chintz
sofa by the side of Mrs. Raggles, to whom she was administering hiaras-
chino. The pnge with the sugr-loaf buttons, who carried about Becky's
pink notes, nnd jumped alout her little carriage with sch alacrity, was
now engaged putting his fingers into a cream dish; the footman was talk-
ing to aggles, who hnd a face full of perplexity and woe-and yet, though

fingers from his mouth with a momentary terror: but the cook took of a
glass of Maraschino, of whieh Mrs. Raggles hal had enough, staring at
IBecky over the little gilt glass as she drained its contents. The liquor
appeared to give the odious rebel courage.

antd defective intonation, that he, too, had had recourse to vinous
stimulus.
Mr. Raggles,'' suid Becky, in a passion of vexation, `` you will not
urely let me be insulted by tlat drunken man'' :Holl your noise,
Trotter; do now,'' said Simpson the page. He wus affccted by his mis-
trcss's deplorable situation, and succeeded in preventing an outrageous
denial of the epithet `drunkcn' on the footman's part.
O Mam,'' said Raggles, `'`I reer thought to live to see this year day.

enumeration of his griefs. All hc said was true. Becky ond her husband
ad ruined him. te had bills coming due next weck and no means to

present to look at one another with a wild surprise, nnl with it Rcbeccn

She bethought herself of the trinkets which lad been left on the ground,
and felt certain that the woman had fled.  Good Heavensl was ever
such ill luek as mine2'' she ssid ; ``to be so near, and to lose all. Is it
all too lateP No; there was one chance more,''
She dressed herself, and went away unmolested this time, but alone. It
was four o'clock. She went swiftly down the streets (she had no money to
pay for a carriage), and never stopped until she came to Sir Pitt Crawley's
door, in Grent Gunt Street. Where was Ldy Jane Crawley She was
at church. Becky was not sorry. Sir Pitt was in his study, and had
given orders not to be disturbed-she must see him-she slipped by the
sentinel in livery at once, and was in Sir Pitt's room before the astonislel
Baronet had cven lnid down the paper.
IIe turued rel aud started back from ler with a look of great alarm and
horror.
 Do not look so,'' she sid. ` I am not guilty, Pitt, dear Pitt; you
were my friend onee. Before God, I am not guilty. I seem so. Eery-
thing is nagaiust me. And Ol at such a momentl just when all my hopes
were abont to be renlised: just when happiness was in store for us.''
Ie this true, what I see in the paper, ten%'' Sir Pitt said-a para-
grsph in which had greatly surprised him.
 It is true. Lord Steyne told me on Friday night, the night of that
fatal ball. He has been promiscd an appointment nny time these six
months. Mr. Martyr, the Colonial Seeretary, told him yesterday that
it was made out. That unlucky arrest ensued; that horrible meeting.
I was only guilty of too much devotedness to Rawlon's service. I hae
receivel Lord Steyne alone n hundred times before. I confess I had
money of which awdon knew nothing. Don't you know how careless he
is of it, and could I dare to confide it to him?'' And so she went on
with a perfectly connected story, which she poured into the ears of her
perplexed kinsman.
It was to the following effect. Becky owned, and with perfect frank-
ness, but dcep contrition, that haing remarkel Lord Steyne's partiality
for her (nt the mention of which Pitt blushed), and being secure of her
own virtue, she had etermined to turn the great peer's attachment to the
ndvantage of herself and her family. ``I looked for a peerage for you,
Pitt,'' she said, (the brother-in-law agin turned red).  We have talked
about it. our genius and Lord Steyne's interest made it more tlau
probable, lad not this dreadful calamity come to put an end to all our
hopes. But, first, I own that it was my object to rescue my dear hus-
band,-lim whom I love in spite of all his ill usnge and suspicions of
me,-to remove him from the poverty and ruin which was impending over
us. I snw Lorl Steyne's partiality for me,'' she said, casting down her
eyes.``I own thnt I did everything in my power to make myself pleasing
to him, and as far as an honest woman may, to secure his-his esteen.
It was only on Friday morning that the news arried of the death of tle
Goverunor of Coventry Island, and my Lord instantly secured the appoint-
ment for my dear husband. It was intended as a surprise for him,-he was
to see it in the papers to-day. Even after that horrid arrest took place (t

expenses of which Lord Steyne generously said he would settle, so that 1
was in a manner prevented from coming to my husband's assistance), my
Lord waslaughing with me, and saying tlat my dearest Rawdon would be
consolel when he read of his appointment in the paper, in that shocking
spun- bailiff's house. And then-then he came home. His suspicions
were excited,-the drendful scene took place between my Lord and my
cruel, cruel Rawdon,-and, O my Go, what will happen net Pitt,
dear Pittl pity me, and reconcile usl'' And as she spoke she flung
herself down on her knees, and bursting into tears, seizel hold of Pitt's
hand, which she kissed passionately.
It was in this very attitude that Lady Jane, who, returning from church,
ran to her husband's room directly she henrl Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was
closeted there, found the Baronet and his sister-in-law.

Lady Jane said, trembling in every limb, and turning quite pale. (Her

tnke of thnt menl, and of the devilled legs of fowls aud. soda-water with
which these young gentlemen fortified themsclires. Then they had a con-
ersation befitling the day and their time of life : about the nexrt pigeon-
match at Bnttersea, with relative bets upon oss and Osbaldiston: about
MIademoiselle Ariane of the Hrench Opera, and who had left her, and how
she was consoled by Panther Carr; and about the fight between the Butcher
and the Pet, and the probabilities that it was a cross. oung Tandyman,
a hero of seventeen, laboriously endeavouring to gct up a pair of musta-
chios, had seen the fight, and spoke in the most scientifie manner about the
battle, and the condition of the men. It was he who had driven the
Butcher on to the ground in his drag, and passed the whole of the pre-
vious night with him. Had there not been foul play he must have won it.

and used to be birched at Eton.
So they went on talking about duncers, fights, drinking, demireps, until
Maemurdo came down and joined the boys and the convrersation. He did
not appear to think that any cspeciul reverence was due to their boyhood;
the old fellow cut in with stories, to the full as choice as any the youngest
rake present hnd to tell ;-nor did his own gray hairs, nor their smooth faces
detain him. Old Mne was famous for his good stories. He wns not exactly
n lady's man; that is, men asked him to dine rather at the houses of their
mistresses than of their mothers. Tere can scarcely be a life lower, per-
haps, than his ; but he was quite contented with it, such as it was, and led
it in perfect good nature, simplicity, and modeaty of demeanour.
By the time MIac had finished a copious breakfast, most of the others
had concluded their meal. oung Lord Varinas was smoking an immense
MIeersehaum pipe, while Captain klugues wns employed with a cigar: that
violent little devil Tandyman, with his little bull-terrier between his legs,
was tossing for shillings with all his might (that fellow was always at
some game or other) against Captain Deuceace: and Mac and Rawdon
walked off to the Club, neither, of course, laviug gien any hint of the
business which was oceupying their minds. Both, on the other hand,
had joined pretty gaily in the conversation; as, why should tley interrupt

other ocenpations in Vanity Fair,-the crowds were pouring out of chureh

into their Club.
The oll bueks and habitues, who ordinarily stand gaping and grinning
out of the great front window of the Club, had not arrived at their posts
ns yet,-the newspaper-room was almost empty. One man was present
whom HRawdon did not know; another to whom he owed a little score for
whist, and whom, in consequence, he did not cnre to meet ; a third was
reading the oyalist (a periodicul famous for its scandal and its attachment
to Church and King) unday paper at the table, and, looking up at Crawley
with some interest, said, ` Crawley, l congratulate you.''
 What do you mean '' said the Colonel.
`It 's in the Olaerzer and the Royaliat too,'' said Mr. Smith.
What '' Rawdon cried, turning very red. He thought that the affair
with Lord Steyne was already in the public prints. Smith looked up
wondering and smiling at the agitation which the Colonel exhibited as he
took up the paper, and trembling, began to read.
Mr. Smith and MIr. Brown (the gentleman with whom Rawdon had the
outstanding whist account) had been talking about tle Colonel just before
he came in.
It is come just in the nick of time,'' snid Smith. `' I suppose Crawley
had not a shilling in the world.''

'..asen
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband,'' answered the other,
enigmatically, and went to read his papers.
Rawdon, for his part, read in the Royalist the following astonishing
paragraph:-
GovEoRsIP oOP CovETRY IsLAND.-H.M.S. ellowjaek, Com-
mander Jaunders, has brought letters and papers from Coventry Island.
H. E. Sir Thomas Liverscege had fallen a victim to the prevailing fever at
Swamptown. His loss is deeply felt in the flourishing colony. We hear
that the Goernorship has been offered to Colonel Rawdon Crawley, C.B.,
a distinguished WVaterloo officer. We need not only men of ackowledged
bravery, but men of administrative talents to superintend the affairs of
our colonies; and we have no doubt that the gentleman selected by the
Colonial Office to fill the lamented vacaney which has occurred at Coventry
Island is admirably caleculated for the post which le is about to occupy.''

perplexed over the announcement, the Club waiter brought in to the
Colonel a card, on which the nae of M. Wenham was engraved, who
begged to see Colonel Crawley.
The Colonel and his aide-de-camp went out to meet the gentlemn,
rightly conjecturing that he was an emissary of Lord Steyne. ` How d'ye

and grasping Crawley's land with great cordiality.

done to the principal. Mac pul out one finger, armed with a buckskin
glove, and made a very frigid bow to Mr. Wenham over his tight craat.
He was, perhaps, discontented at being put in comnmunicntion with a
pekin, and thought that Lord Steyne should have sent him a Colonel nt
the very least.
"`As Macmurdo aets for me, and knows what I meaa,'' Crawley said, `1

solemnity; ``I was sent for tis morning by my Lord Steyne, and found

the outrage of lst night.''
Crawley nodded. You 're coming to the point, Wenham,'' he said.
 I tried my utmost to calm Lord Steyne. Good God1 Sir,'' I said,
how I regret that Mr. Wenham and myself hsd not aeeepted Mrs.
Crawley's invitation to sup with her1''
 She asked you to sup with herP'' Captain Naemurdo said.
'Mfter the Opera. Here's the note of initation-stop-no, this is
another paper-I thought I had it, but it's of no consequence, and I
pledge yon my word of honour as a gentleman to the faet. If we had come
-and it was only one of Mrs. Wenham's headaehes which preented us
-she suffers under them a good deal, especially in the spring-if we had
come, and you had returned home, there would have been no quarrel, no
insnlt, no suspicion-and so it is positively because my poor wife hasa
headache that you are to bring death down upon two men of honour, and
plunge two of the most excellent and ancient families in the kingdom into
disgraee and sorrow,''
Mr, Maecmurdo looked at his principal with the air of a man profoundly
puzzled : and Rawdon felt with a kind of rage that his prey was escaping
him. He did not believe a word of the story, and yet, how discredit or
disprove it?
Mr. Wenham ocontinued wth the same fluent oratory, which in his plaee
in parliament he had so often pructised-`' I sate for an hour or more by
Lord Steyne's bedsile, beseeching, imploring Lord Steyne to forego hi
intention of demnanding a meeting. I pointed out to him that the cireum-
stances were after all swepicious-they were suspicious. I acknowledge it,
any man in your position might have been taken in-I said that a man
furious with jealusy is to all iutents and purposes a madman, and should
be as such regaraed-that a duel between you must lead to the disgrace of
nll parties concerned-that a man of his Lordship's exalted station had no
right in these days, when tle most atrocious revolutionary principles, and
the most dangerous levelling doctrines are preached among the vulgar, to
create a public scandal; and that, however innocent, the common people
would insist thnt he was guilly. In fine, I implored him not to send the
challenge,''
I don't believe one word of the whole story,'' said Rawlon, grinling
his teeth.  I blieve it n nmnel lic, and that you 're in it, Mr, Wenha.
If the chllenge don't come from him, by Jove it shnll come from me.''
MF. WYenham turned deadly pale at this savnge interruption of the
Colonel, and looked towards the door.

But he found a champion in Captain Macmurdo. That gentleman rose
up with an oath, and rebuked Rawdon for his language.  You put the
alTair into my hands, and you shall act as I think fit, by Jove, and not as
you do. Iouhave no right to insult Mr. Wenham with this sort of langusge;
and dammy, Mr. Wenham, you deserve an apology. And as for a chal-
lenge to Lord Steyne, you may get somebody else to carry it, I won't. If
my lord, after being thrshed, chooses to sit still, dnmmy let him. And
as for the affair with-with Mrs. Crawley, my belief is, tlere 's notling
proved at all: that your wife 's innocent, as inuocent ans Mr. Wenham says
she is: and at any rate, that you would be a d-fool not to take the place
and hold your tongue.''
Captain Mnemurdo, you speak like a man of sense,'' Mr. Wenham
cried ont, immensely relieved- I forget any words that Colonel Crawley
has used in the irritation of the moment.''
I thought you would,'' Rawdon said, with a sneer.
"`Shut your meuth, you old stoopid,'' the Captin sei good-naturedly.
Mr. enham ain't a fighting man; and quite right, too.''
e This matter, in my belief,'' the Steyne emissary cried, ``ought to be
buried in the most profound oblivion. A word concerning it should neer
pass these doors. I speak in the interest of my friend, as well as of
Colonel Crawley, who persists in considering me his enemy.''
I suppose Lord Steyne won't talk about it very much,'' said Captain
Maemurdo; ` and lI don't see why our side slould. The affair ain't a
very pretty one, any way you take it ; and the less said about it the better.
It 's you are thrashed, and not us; and if you are satisfied, why, I think,
we should be,''
Mr. Wenham took his hat, upon this, and Captain Macmurdo following
him to the door, shut it upon himself and Lord Steyne's agent, leaving
Rawdon ehafing within. When the two were on the other side, Macmurdo
looked hard at the other ambassador, and with an expression of anything
but respect on his round jolly face.
 Yodu don't stick at a trifle, Mr. Wenham,'' he said.
You flatter me, Captain Maemurdo,'' answered the other, with a smile.
`Upon my honour and conscienee, now, Mrs. Crawley did ask us to sup
after the Opera.''
Of course; and Mre. Wenham had one of her headnches. I say, I've
got a thousand-pounl note here, which I will give you if you will give me
a receipt, plesse; and I will put the note up in an envelope for Lord
Steyne. My man shan't fight him. But we had rather not take his
money.''
It was all a mistake,-all a mistake, my dear Sir,'' the other said,
with the utmost innocence of mnnner; and was bowed down the Clul
teps by Cptain Macmurdo, just as Sir Pitt Crawley ascended them.
There was a slight nacquaintance between these to gentlemen; and the
Captain, going bneck ith the Baronet to the room where the latter's
brother was, told Sir Pitt, in eonfidence, that he had made the afair all

And after this prefaee, he tried with all his eloquence to effeet a reson-
iliation between Rawdon and his wife. He reespitlated tke statements
which Becky had made, pointed out the prohabilities of their truth, and
asserted his own firm bclief in her innoeene.
But Rawdon would not hear of it,  8he has kep moeney eoneealed
from me these ten years,'' he said.  She swore, last night only, she had
none from Steyne. She knew it was all up, directly I found it. If she 's
not guilty, Pitt, she 's as bad as guilty; and I 'll uever see her again,--
never,'' HIis head sank down on his chest as he spoke the words; and he
looked quite broken and sad.
ePoor old boy,'' Maemurdo said, shaking his head.
Rawdon Crawley resisted for some time the idea of taking the plaee
which had been procured for him by so odious a patron : and was also for
removing the boy from the school where Lord Steyne's interest had plseed
him. He was innced, however, to acquiesce in theso benefits by the
entreaties of his brother and Maemurdo: but mainly by the latter pointing
ont to him what a fury Steyne would be in, to think that his enemy's
fortune was made through his means.
When the Maruis of Steyne eame aboad after his accident, the Colo-
nial Seeretary bowed up to him and congratulated himself and the Sarvice
upon having made so exeellent an appoitment. These ongrstulations
were received with a degree of gratitude which may be imsgined on the
purt of Lord Steyue.
The secret of the reneosre between him and Colonel Crawley was huried
in the profoundest oblivion, ns Wenhm said; that is by the seeonds and
the principals. But before that evening was over it was talked of at
fifty dinner-tables in Vanity Fair. Little Cackleby himself weat to seen
evening parties, and told the story with eomments and emendations at
each place. How Mrs. WFashington Whitrevelled in it1 The Bishopess
of Ealing was shocked beyond expression: the Bishop went and wrote his
name down in the visiting-book at Gaunt Honse that very day. Little
Southdown was sorry: so you may be sure was his sister Lady Jane, very
sorry. Lady Southdown wrote it off to her other daughter at the Cape of
Good Hope. It was town-talk for at least three days, and wss only kept
out of the newspapers by the exertions of Mr. Wagg, ating upon a hint
from Mr. Wenham.
The bailiffis and brokers seized upon poor aggles in Curzon Street, and
the late fair tenant of thnt poor little mansion was in the meanwhile-
where Who caredP W'ho asked after a dsy or two Was she guilty
or not: We all know how charitable the world is, nnd how the verdict
of Vanity Fuir goes when thcre is a doubt. Some people said she had
gone to Naples in pursuit of Lord Steync; whilst others averred that his
Lordship quitted thnt city, anl fled to Pnlermo on hearing of RBecky's
nrrivnl; some said shc was living in Bierstadt, and had become a damne
d Monneur to the ueen of Bulgaria; some that she was at Boulogue;
au others, at n boarding-house at Cheltenham.

Rawdon made her a tolerable annuity; and we may be sure that sle was
a woman who could make a little money go a great way, as the saying is.
He would have paid his debts on leaving lngland, could he hnve got any
Insurance Office to take his life ; but the climate of Coventry Island was
so bad that he could borrow no money on the strength of his nnnuity.
He remittel, however, to his brother punctually, nnd wrote to his little
boy regularly every mail. He kept Macmurdo in cigars; and sent over
quantities of shells, cayenne pepper, hot pickles, guava jelly, and colonial
produce to Lady Jane. He sent his brother home the Sweamp ITovnu
Gazette, in which the new Governor was praised with immense enthusiasm;
whereas, the amp Tboon Sentinel, whose wife was not asked to Govern-
ment House, declared that his Excellency was a tyrnnt, compared to whom
Nero was an enlightened philanthropist. Little Rawdon used to like to
get the papers and read about his Excellency.
His mother nevor made any movement to see the child. He went
home to his aumt for Sundays aud holidays; ho soon knew every bird's
nest about ueen's Crawley, and rode out with Sir Huddlestone's hounds,
which he admired so on his first well-remembered visit to Hampshire.

been reading during the day, and was greatly interested at the report the
boy gave of his own studies: pretending to understand little George when
he spoke regarding them. lIe made a hundred blunders, and showed his
ignorance many a time. It did not inerease the respect which the child
had for his senior. A quick brain and a better education elsewhere showed
the boy very soon that his grandsire was a dullard: and he began accord-
ingly to command lim and to look down upon him; for his previous
education, humble and contracted as it had bcen, had made a much better
gentleman of Georgy than any plans of his grandfather could make him.
He had been brought up by a kind, weak, and tender woman, who had no
pride about anything, but about him, and whose heart was so pure and
whose bearing was so meek and humble, that she could not but needs be a
true lady. She busied herself in gentle offices and quiet duties ; if she
never said brilliant tlings, she never spoke or thought uukind ones:
guileless and artless, loving and pure, indeed how could our poor littla
Amelia be other than a real gentlewomanf
Young Georgy lorled over this soft and yielding nature; and tle con
trast of its simplicity and delicacy with the coarse pomposity of the dull
old man with whom he next came in contact, made him lord over the
latter too. If he had been a Prince Royal he could not hae been better
brought up to think well of himself.
Whlst lis mother was yearning after him at home, and I do believe
eery hour of the day, and during most hours of the sad lonely nights,
thinking of him, this young gentleman had a number of pleasures and
consolations administered to him, which made him ifor his part bear the
aseparation from Amelia very easily. Little boys who cry when they are
going to school-cry because they are going to a very uncomfortable
place. It is only a very few who weep from sheer affection. When you
think that the eyes of your clildhood dried at the sight of a piece of
gingerbread, and tlat a plum-cake was a compensation for the agony of
parting with your mamma and sisters; O my friend and brother, you need
not be too confident of your own fine feelings.
Well, then, Master George Osborne had every comfort and luxury tht
a wealthy and luvish old grandfather thought fit to provide. The coach-
man was instructed to purchaso for him the handsomest pony which
could be bought for money; and on this George was taught to ride, first
at a riding-sclool, whence, after he had performed sutisfactorily without
stirrups, and over the leapiug-bar, he ws condueted through the New
Rond to Regent's Park, and then to Hyde Park, where he rode in stuate
with Martin the coaehman behind him. Old Oborne, who took matters
more easily in the City now, where he left his affairs to his junior pnrtners,
would ofen ride out with Miss O. in the same fashionable direction. As
lIittle Georgy came cantering up with his landyfied air, and his heels down,
his grandfather would nudge the lad's aunt, and say, ``Look, Miss O''
And he would laugh, and his face would grow red with pleasure, as he
nodded out of the window to the boy, as the groom saluted the carrisge,
and the footman saluted Master George. Heretoo his aunt, Mrs. Frederick
Bulloek, (whose chariot might daily be seen in the Ring, with bullocks or
emblazoned on the panels and harness, und three pasty-faced little Bulloeks,

coered with cockades and feathers, staring from the windows),-Mre.
Frederick Bnllook, I say, flung glanees of the bitterest hatred at the little
upstart as he rode by with his hand on his side and his hat on one ear, as
proud as a lord,

Thongh he wns scareely eleven years of age, Mater George wore strsps
and the most henutiful little boots like a mmn. He hal gilt spurs, anda
gold-headed whip, and a fine pin in his handkerehief; and the neatest
little kid gloves which Lamb's Conduit Street could furnish. His- mother
had given him a couple of neck-cloths, and carefully hemmed and mde
some little shirts for him; but when her Eli came to see the widow, they
were replaced by much finer linen. He had little jewelled hnttons in the
lawn shirt-fronts. Her humble presents had been put aside-I believe
Miss Osborne had given them to the conchman's boy. Amelia tried to
think she was pleased at the ehange. Indeed, she was happy and charmed
to see the boy looking so beautiful.
he had had a little blaeck profile of him done for a shilling; and this
was hung up by the side of another portrait over her bed. One dsy the
boy came on his accustomed visit, galloping down the little street st
Brompton, and bringing, as usual, all the inhabitants to the windows to
admire his splendour, and with great eagerness, and a look of triumph in
his face, he pulled a case out of his great-coat-(it was a natty white gret-
coat, with a cape and a velet collar)-pulled ont a red moroeeo case,
which he gave her.
I bought it with my own mone, Mamma,'' he sid. I thought
yon 'd lke it.''
Amelia opened the case, and giving s little ory of delighted sffetian,

eizel the oy nnd embreed him a hndred times. It was a miniatunre of
himself, very prettily done (though not half handsome enough, we may be
sure, the wilow thought). His granlfather had wished to have a picture
of him by an artist wliose works, exhibitel in a shop-window, in South-
ampton Row, had caught the old gentleman's eyes; nnd George, who had
plenty of money, bethought him of asking the psinter how much a copy
of the little portrait would cost, saying that he would pay for it out
of his own money, mnd that he wanted to give it to his mother. ITle
pleased painter execntel the copy for a small price; and old Osborne
himself, when he heard of the incident, growled out his stisfaction, and
gave the boy twice as mnny sovereigns as he paid for the miniature.
But what was the grandfather's pleasure compared to Amelia's extacyf
That pnroof of the boy's affeetion charmed her so, that she thought no
ehild in the world was like her's for goodness. For long weeks after, the
thought of his love made her happy. She slept better with the picture
under her pillow; and how many many times did she kiss it, and weep
and pray over itl A smnll kindness from those she loed made that
timid heart grateful. Sines her parting with George she had had no
such joy and consolation.
At his new home Master George ruled llke a lord: at dinner he invited
the ladies to drink wine with the utmost ooolness, and took off his cham-
pigne in a way which charmed his old grndfhther. `Look at him,'' the
old man would say, nudging his neighhour with a delighted purple face,
`did you ever see such a ehapf Lord, Lord l hs'llbe ordering a dressing-
case next, and razors to shave with; I 'm blest if lie wont,''
The antics of the lad did not, howevar, dellght. Mr. Oborne's friends
so much as they pleasel the old gentleman. It guve Mr. Justice Coffin
no pleasuro to hear Georgy cut into the conversation and spoil his stories.
Colonel Fogey wns not interested in sesing the little boy hnlf tipsy.
Mr. Serjeant Toffy's lady felt no partioulr gratitude whsen, with a twist of
his elbow, he tilted a glass of port-wine over her yellow satin, and laughed
at the disaster: nor was she better plensd, nlthough old Osborne was
highly delighted, when Georgy ```wopned '' her third boy (a young gentle-
man a year older ttisn Georgy, and by chancse lome for the holidays from
Dr. Tiekleus's at ling Sshiool) in Rusell Square. George's grandfather
gave the boy a cple of sowereigns fr that fnt, and promised to reward
him further for every boy bove his own sie and age whom he wopped in
a similar mannar. It is diffieult to say what good the old man sw in these
combats; hehad a vague notionthat qurreling made boys hardy, and that
tyranny was nausefl assomplishment for them to learn. English youth
have been so eduoted time out of mind, ad we have hundreds of thou-
sands of apologists mnd admirers of injustice, isery, and brutality, as
perpetrated among children.
Flushed with praise and victory over Master Tofy, Gcorge wished
aturally to pursue his conquests further, and one day as he was strutting
about in prodigiously dandified new clothes, nenr St. Paneras, and a young
baker's boy male srcastic comments upon his appearance, the youthful
patricin pulled off his dandy jaeket with great spirit, and giing it in
chnrge to the friend who accompanied him (Master Todd, of Great Coram
506
vNIY AIB.
Street, Russell quare, seon of the junior partner of the honse of Osborne and
Co.)-George tried to wop the little baker. But the chanees of war were
unfaourable this time, and the little baker wopped Georgy: who came
home with a rueful black eye and all his fine shirt firill dibbled with the
claret drawn from his own little nose. He told his grandfather that he
had been in combat with a giant; and frightened his poor mother at
Brompton with long, nd by no means authentie, aecounts of the battle.
This young Todd, of Coram Street, Russell Square, was Master George's
great friend and admirer. They both had a taste for painting theatrical
charaeters ; for hard bake and rspbeny tarts; for sliding and skating in the
egent'a Park and the Serpentine, when the weather permitted; for going
to the play, whither they were often conducted, by Mr. Osborne's orders,
by Rowson, Master George's appointed body-servant; with whom they
sate in great eomfort in the pit.

In the company of this gentleman they visited all the principal thetres
of the metropolis-knew the names of all the actors from Drury Lane t

family and their youthful friends, with Wet's famous characters, on their
pasteboard thcatre. Rowson, the footman, who was of a generous dis-
position, would not unfrequently, when in casl, treat his young master to
oysters after the play, and to a glass of rum-shrub for a night-cap. We
may be pretty certain that Mr. Rowson profited in his turn, by his young
master's liherality and gratitule for the pleasures to which the footman
inducted him.
A famous tailor from the West End of the town,-Mr. Osborne would
have none of your City or Holborn bunglers he said, for the boy (though
a City tailor was good enough for hin),-was summoned to ornament little
George's person, and was told to spare no expense in so doing. So, Mr.
Woolsey of Conduit-street, gave a loose to his imagination, and sent the
chill home faney trousers, faney waistcoats, nnd fancy jackets enough
to furnish a achool of little dandies. Georgy hal little white wistcoats
for evening parties and little cut velvet waistcoats for dinners, and a dear
little darling shawl dressing-gown, for all the world like a little man.
He dressed for dinner every day, ``like a regulur West End Swell,'' as his
grandfather remarked: one of the domestics was affected to his especial
service, attended him nt his toilette, answered his bell, and brought him
his letters always on a silver tray.
Georgy, nfter breakfast, would sit in the arm-chair in the dining-room,
and read the ` Morning Post,'' just like a grown-up man. :` How he du
dam and swear,'' the servants would cry, delighted at his precocity. Those
who rememberel the Captain his father, declared Master George was his
P every inch of him. He made the house lively by his activity, lis
imperiousness, his scolding, and his good-nature.
George's education was confided to a neighbouring scholar anl private
pelgogue who ` prepared young noblemen and gentlemen for the Univer-
sities, the senate, mnd the learned prolfcssions: whose system did not
embrace the degrading corporal severities, still practised at the ancient
places of education, and in whose family the pupils would find the
elegancies of refined society and the confidence and affection of a home.''
It was in this way that the Reverend Lawrence Venl of Hart Street,
Bloomsbury, and domestic Chaplain to the Enrl of Bareacres, strove with
Mrs. eal his wife to entice pupils.
By thus advertising aud pushing sedulously, the domestic Chaplain and
his Lady generully succeeded in haing one or two scholars by them: who
paid a high figure: and were thought to be in uncommonly comfortable
quarters. There was a large West Indian, whom nobody cme to see,
with a mahogany complexion, a woolly hed, and an exceedingly dandified
appearance: there was another hulking boy of three-and-twenty whose
education had been negleeted, and whom Mr. and Mras. Veal were
to introduce into the polite world: there were two sons of Colonel
Bangles of the East India Company's Service : these four sate down to
dinner at Mrs. Veal's genteel bouard, when Georgy was introduced to her
establislment.
Georgy was, like some doren other pupils, only a day boy: he arrived
in the morning under the guardianship of his friend Mr, Rowaon, and if it

was fine, would ride away in the aftemnoon on his pony, followed by the
groom. The wealth of his grandfather was reported in the school to be
prodigious. The Re. Mr. Veal used to compliment Georgy upon it
personally, warning him that he was destined for a high station; that it
became him to preparo, by sedulity and docility in youth, for the lofty
duties to whiceh he would be called in mature age; that obedience in the
hild was the best preparation for command in the man; and that he
therefore begged George would not bring toffy into the school, and ruin
the health of the Masters Bangles, who had everything they wanted at the
elegnt anl abundant table of Mrs. Veal.
With respect to learning, `' the Curriculum,'' as Mr. Veal loved to call
it, was of prodigious extent: and the young gentlemen in Hart Street
might leurn a something of every known science. The Rey. Mr. Veal had
an orrery, an electrifying machine, a turning lathe, a theatre (in the wash-
honuse), a chemical apnaratns, and, what he cnlled a select library of all the
works of the best authors of ancient and modern times and langunges.
lIe took the boys to the British Museum, and deseanted upon the antiqui-
ties and the specimens of natural history there, so that sudienees would
gather romnd him as he spoke, and all Bloomsbury highly admired him as
a prodigiously well informed man. And whenever he spoke (which he did
almost always), he took care to produce the very finest and longest words
of which the vocabulary gave him the use; rightly judging, that it was as
cheap to employ a handsome, large, and sonorous epithet, as to use a little
stiny one.
Thus he would say to George in sehool, '`I observed on my return home
from taking the indulgenee of an evening's scientific conversation with my
excellent friend Doctor Bulders-a true areheologian, gentlemen, a true
archaeologian-that the windows of your veerated grandfather's almost
princely mansion in Russell quare were illuminated as if for the purposes
of festivity. Am lI riht in my conjecture, that Mr. Osborne entertained a
soeiety of chosen spirits round his sumptuous board last night ''
Little Georgy, who had considerable humour, and used to mimie Mr,
Veal to his face with great spirit and dexterity, would reply, that Mr, .
was quite correct in his surmise.
hen those friends who had the hononr of partaking of MIr. Osborne's
hospitality, gentlemen, had no reason, I will lay any wager, to complain
of their repast. I myself have leen more than once so favoured. (By the
way, Master Osborne, you came a little late this morning, and have been
a defaulter in this respect more than onee). I myself, I say, gentlemen,
humble as lI am, have been found not unworthy to share Mr. Osborne's
elegant hospitality. And though I have feasted with the great and noble
of the world-for I presnme that I may call my excellent friend and patron,
the Right Honourable George Esrl of Bareaeres, as one of the number-yet
I assure you that the bonrd of the British merchant was to the full ass
riehly served, and his reception as gratifying and noble. Mr. Bluck,
Sir, we will resume, if you please, that passage of Eutropius, which ws
interrupted by the late arrival of Master Osborne.'''
To this great man George's education was for some time entrusted.

Amelia was bewildered by his phrses, but thought him a prodigy of
learning. `That poor widow made friends with Mr. Vcal, for reasons of
her own. She liked to be in the house, and see Georgy coming to school
there. fSihe liked to he asked to Mre. Veal'as cosersaeioni, whieh took
place once a onth (as you were informed on pink cards, with AeHNH
engraved on them), and where the Professor weleomed his ppils and their
friends to weak tea and sceientifie conversation. Poor little Aelia never
issed one of these entertainments, and thought tlem delicious so long as
she might hare Georgy sitting y her. And she would walk from bBromptou
in nny weather, and embrace Mrs. Voal with tearful gratitude for the
delightful evening she had paesed, when, the company havring retired and
Georgy gone off witl MIr. Rowson his attendant, poor krs. Oshorne put
on her clonks and her ahawls preparatory to walking home.
As for the lamning whioh Georgy imbibed under this voluble master of
a hundred acienees, to judge from the weekly reports which the lad took
home to his grandfather, his progrees was remarkable. The names of a
seore or more af desirble branehes of knowledge were printed on a table,
and the pupil's progress in eacl was marked by the professor. In Greek
Georgy was prononced aristos, in Latin optimus, in EFrench tres ien,
and so forth; and esrerybody had prizes for everything at the end of the
year. Even Mr. wartz, the woolly-headed young geutleman, and half-
broether to the Honourable Mrs. Mc Mull, and Mr. Bluck, the neglected
young pupil of threeand-tweuty fromn ths agriculturl distriols, and that
idle young seapegraoe of a Master Todd befare mentioned, received little
eighteen-penny hooks, with '' Athene'' engraved in them, and a pompous
Latin inscription from the Professor to his young iriends.
The family of this Mastar Todd were hangers-on of the house of
Oborne. The old gentleman had advncel Todd from being a clerk to
be s junior partner in his eetablishment.
Mr. Osborne was the godfather of young aster Todd (who in subse-
quent life wrote Mr. Obomne Todd on his cards, and became a man of
deeided fashion) while Miss Osborne had aeeompanied Miss Maria Todd
to the font, and gave her proetegee a prayer-book, a collection of trssts, a
volume of very low chureh poetry, or some such msemento of her gooedness
erery year. Miss O. drove the Todds out in ler carriage now and then:
when they were ill her footman, in large plush smalls and waiateoat,
breught jellies and delicacies from Russell Squaro to Coram Street. Coram
Street trembled and looked up to useell Square indeed; and Mrs. Todd,
who had a pretty hand at cutting out paper trimings for haunches of
mutton, and could make flowers, ducks, &c., out of turnips and carrots in
a very credilable manner, would go to ``the Bquare,'' as it was called, and
aasiat in the preparations incident to a great dinner, without even so mueh
as thinking of sitting down to the banquet. If asny guest failed at the
eleenth hour, Todd was asked to dine. Mrs. Todd and Maria eame aeross
in the evening, slipped in with a muffled knoek, and were in the drawing-
rooin by the time Miss Osborne and the ladies unler her convoy reached
that apartment; and ready to fire off luets and sing until the gentlemnen
came up. Poor Maria Todd; poor young ladyl Iow she had to work

Thus it seemed to be decreed by fate, that Georgy was to domineer over
everybody with whom he came in contact, and that friends, relatives, and
domestics were all to bow the knee before the little fellow. It must be
owned that he accommodated himself very willingly to this arrangement.
Most people do so. And Georgy liked to plasy the part of master, and
perhaps had a natural aptitude for it.
In Russell Square everybody ws afrasid of M. Osborne, and Mr. Osborne
was afraid of Georgy. The boy's dashing manners, and off-hand rattle
about books and learning, his likeness to his father, (dead unreconciled in
Brussels yonder), awed the old gentleman, and gve the young boy the
mastery. The old man would start at some hereditary feature or tone
nceonsciously used by the little lad, and faney that George's father wass
again before him. He tried by indulgence to the grandson to make up for
harshness to the elder George. People were surprised at his gentleness to
thees He grelsd and sses at Niss Ohome as usul : and wsoukd
smile when George came down late for breakfast.
Miss Osborne, George's aunt, was a faded old spinster, broken down
by more than forty years of dullness and coarse usage. It was easy for a
lad of spirit to master her. And whenever George wanted anything from
her, from the jam-pots in her cupboards, to the craeked and dry old colours
in her pasint-box (the old paint-box which she had had when she wass a
pupil of Mr. Smee, and was still almost young and blooming), Georgy
took possession of the object of his desire, whieh obtained, he took no
further notice of his aunt.
For his friends and cronies, he had a pompons old schoolmaster, who
fattered him, and a toady, his senior, whom he could thrash. It was
denr Mrs. Todd's delight to leave him with her youngest daughter, Ross
Jemima, a darling child of eight years old. The little pir looked so
well together, she would say (but not to the folks in 'the Square,' we
may be sure),- Who knows what might happen Don't they make a
pretty little couple'' the fond mother thought.
The broken-spirited, old, maternal grandfather was likewise subject to
the little tyrant. He could not help respecting a lad who had such fine
elothes, and rode with a groom behind him. Georgy, on his side, was in
the constant habit of hearing course abuse and vulgar satire levied at
John Sedley, by his pitiless old enemy, Mr. Osborne. Osborne used to
call the other the old pauper, the old coal-man, the old bankupt, and by
many other such names of brutal contumely. How was little George to
respect a man so prostrate  few months after he was with his paternal
grandfather, Mrs. Sedley died. There had been little love between her and
the child. He did not care to show much grief. He came down to visit
his mother in a fine new suit of mourning, and was very angry that he
could not go to a play upon whieh he hnd set his henrt.
The illncss of that oll lady had been the occupation and perhaps the
eafeguard of Anelin. Wht do men know about women's martyrdoms?

pains which are meekly bomne by many women, Ceaseless slavery meeting
with no reward; constant gentleness and kindness met by cruelty as con-
stant; love, labour, patience, watchfulness, without even so much as the
ackmowledgment of a good word; all this, how many of them hae to
bear in quiet, and appear abroad with cheerful faces as if they felt
nothing. Tender slaves that they are, they must needs be hypocrites and
wek.
Fromn her chair Amelia's mother had taken to her bed, which she had
never left: and from which Mrs. Osborne herself was never absent except
when she rn to see George. The old lady grudged her even those rare
visits: she, who had been a kind, smiling, good-natured mother once,
in the days of her prosperity, but whom poverty and infirmities had
broken down. Her illness or estrangement lid not affect Amelia. They
rather enabled her to support the other enalamity under which she was suf-
fering, und from the thoughts of which she was kept by the ceaseless calle
of the invlid. Amelia bore her harshness quite gently: smoothed the
uneasy pillow; was always ready with a soft answer to the watchful, queru-
lous voiee; soothed the sufferer with words of hope, such as her pious
simple heart could best feel and utter, and elosed the eyes that had once
looked so tenderly upon her.
Then all her time and tenderness were devoted to the eonsolation and
comfort of the bereaved old father, who was stunned by the blow which
had befullen him, and tood utterly alone in the world. His wife, his
honour, his fortune, everything he loved best had fallen away from him.
There was only Amelia to stand by and support with her gentle arms the
tottering, heart-broken, old man. We are not going to write the history:
it would be too dreary and stupid. I csn see Vanity Fair yawning oer
it: d'aeanece.
One day as the young gentlemen were assembled in the study at the
Rev. Mr. Veul's, and the domestic chaplain to the Right Honourable the
Enrl of Barencres was spouting away as usual-a smart carriage drove
np to the door decorated with the statue of Athene, and two gentlemen
stepped ont. The yung Masters Bangles rushel to the window, with a
vague notion that their father might have arrived from Bombasy. The
great hulking scholar of three-and-twenty, who was crying secretly over a
passage of Eutropius, flattened his negleeted nose against the panes, and
lookel at the drag, as the aguais de place sprang lrom the box and let out
the persons in the carriage.
It 's as fat one and a thin one,'' Mr. Bluck said, as a thundering knoek
came to the door.
Everybody was interested, from the domestic chplain himself, who
hoped he saw the fathers of some future pupils, down to Master Georgy,
glad of any pretext for lsying lis book down.
The boy in the shabby livery, with the fnded copper-buttons, who
always thurst himself into the tight coat to open the door, cme into the

T was one of the many causes for
personal pride with which ol
Osborne chose to recreate himself,
that Sedley, his ancient rival, enemy,
and benefasetor, was in his lst
days ao utterly defeated and hn-
miliuted, as to be forced to accept
pecuniary obligations at the hands
of the man who had most injurel
and insulted him. The successful
man of the world cursed the old
peuper, and relieved him from time
to time. As he furnished George
with money for his mother, he gave
the boy to understand by hints,
lelivered in his brutal, coarse way,
that George's maternal grandfather
was but a wretehe old bunkrupt
and dependunt, and tlat John Sed-
ley might thank the man to whom
he anlready owed ever so much
money, for the aid which his gene-
rosity now chose to administer.
George carried the pompous supplies to his mother and the shattered
old widower whom it was uow the main busines of her life to tend and
comfort. The little fellow patronised the feeble and disappointed old man.
It may have shown a want of `' proper prile'' in Amelia that she
chose to nccept these money beuefits at the hands of her fuather's encmy.
But proper pride and this poor lady had never had mucl aequaiutancee
together. A disposition naturally simple and demanding protection; a
long course of poverty and. humility, otf dnily privations, and hard words,
of kind offices and no returns, had been her lot ever since womanhool
almost, or since her luckless marriage with George Osborne. You who
see your betters, bearing up under this shame every dsy, meekly sullering
under the slights of fortune, gentle and unpitied, poor, and rather despised

odious and iow.  There must he classes-there must be rich and poor,''
Dives says, smacking his claret- (it is well if he even sends the broken meat
out to Lazarus sitting under the window.) Very true; but think how
mysterious and often unnccountable it is-that lottery of life which gives
to this man the purple nnd fine linen, and sends to the other rags for
garments and dogs for comfortcrs.
So I must own, tlnt without much repining, on the contrary with some-
thing akiu to gratitude, Amelia took the crumbs that her father-in-law let
drop now and then and with them fed her own parent. Directly shc
underatood it to bc her duty, it was this young woman's nature (ladies, she
is but thirty still, nnd we choose to call her a young woman even at that
age)-it was, I sy, her nature to sacrifice hcerself and to fling all that shc
lmat at the fcet of thc beloved object. During what long thankless nights
lad she worked out her fingers for little Georgy whilst ut hoe with her;
what buffets, scorns, privations, poverties had she endured for father aud
motherl And in the midst of all these solitary resignations und unseen
sacrifices, she did not respect herself any uore than the world respected
her; but I believe thought in her heart that she was a poor-spirited,
despicable little creature, whose luck in life was only too good for her
merits. O you poor womenl O you poor secret martyrs and victims,
whose life is a torture, who are stretched on racks in your bedrooms, and
who lay your heads down on the block daily at the rawing-room tall
every an who watches your pains, or peers into those durk places where
the torture is administered to you, must pity you-and-and thank God
that he has a beard. I recollcct seeing, years ago, at the prison for idiots
nnd mahen at Bicetre, near lParis, a poor wretch bent down under the
bondage of lis imprisonment and his personal infirmity, to whom one of

The kindness was too much for the poor epileptic creature. HIe cried
in an anguish of delight and gratitude: if anybody gave you and me a
thousand a-year, or saved our lives, we could not be so affected. And so,
if you properly tyranunise over a woman, you will find a halfp 'orth of
kindness act upon her, and bring tears into her eyes, as though you were
an nngel benefiting her.
Some such boons as these were the best which Fortune allotted to poor
little Amelia. Her life, begun not unprosperously, had come down to
this-to a menn prison ad a long, ignoble bondage. Little George
visited her captivity sometimes, and consoled it with feeble gleams of
encouragement. lussell Square was the boundary of her prison: slc
might wnalk thither occasionally, but was always back to sleep in her cell
at night; to perform cheerlcss duties ; to watch by thnnkless sick-beds;
to suffer the harassment and tyranny of querulous disappointed old age.
IIow many thousnnds of people are there, women for the most part, who
are doomed to endure tlis long slavery ?-who are hospital-nurses without
wages,-sisters of Charity, if yon like, without the romance and tle

They buried melia's mother at the church-yard at Brompton; upon
just sch a rainy, dark day, as Amelia recollected when first she had been
therc to marry George. Ier little boy sate by her sido in pompous new
sables. Shc renemberel the old pew-woman and clerk. Her thoughts
were away in other times as the parson read. But that sle held George's
hand in her own, perhaps she would have liked to change places with..
Then, as usual, she felt ashamed of her selfish thoughts, and prayed
inwardly to be strengthened to lo her duty.
So she determined with all her might and strength to try and make her
old father happy. Sheslaved, toiled, patched and mended, sang nnd played
backgammon, rend out the newspaper, cookel dishes for old Sedley,
walkel him out sedulously into kensington Gardens or the Brompton
Lanes, listened to his stories with untiing smilcs and affectionate
hypaocrisy, or sate musing by lis sile and communing with her own
thoughts and reminiscences, as the old man, feeble and querulous, sunned
himself on the gardcn benches nnd prattled about his wrongs or his
sorrows. Wht sad, unsatisfactory thoughts those of the widow were

George was taken from her: her selfish, guilty love, in both instances,
hal been rcbukel and bitterly chastised. She strove to think it was right
that she should be so punished. She was sucli a miserable wicked sinner.
She was quite alone in the world.
I know that the account of this kind of solitary imprisonment is
insufferably tedious, unless there is some cheerful or humorous incident
to enliven it,-a tender gaoler, for instance, or a waggish commandant of
the fortress, or a mouse to come out and play about Latude's bear and
whiskers, or n subterranean passage under the castle, dug by Trenck witl
his nails and a toothpick: the historian has no such enlivening inceident
to relate in the narrative of Amelin's cptivity. Fancy ler, if you please,
during this period, very sad, but always ready to smile when spoken to; in
a very mean, poor, not to sny vulgar position of life; singing songs, aking
puddings, playing cards, mending stockings, for her old father's benefit.
Bo, never uind, whether she be a heroine or no; or you and I, howeve
old, sceolding, anl bankrupt;-may we have in our last days a kind soft
shoulder on which to lean, and a gentle hand to soothe our gouty old
pillows.
Oll Selley grew very fond of lis daughter after his wife's deth; and
Amelia had her consolation in doing her duty by the old mnn.

ungenteel station of life. etter days, as far as worldly prosperity went,

with our old friend Major Dobbin. It was another old acquaintance
returned to England, and at a time when his presenee was likely to be of
great comfort to his relatives there.
Msjor Dobbin having easily suoceeded in getting leave from his good-
natured commandant to proceed to Madras, and thenee probabhly to Europe,
on urgent private affairs, neer ceased travelling night and day util he
reached his journey's end, and had directed his march with such celerity,
that he arrived nt Madras in a high fever. His servunts who aceompanied
him, brought him to the house of the friend with whom he had resolvel to
stay until lis departure for Europe in a state of delirium; nnd it was
thought for mny many duys that he would never travcl furtler than the
burying-ground of the church of St. George's, where tle troops should
fire n salvo over his grave, and where many a gallant officer lics faur away
from his home.
Here ns the poor fellow lay tossing in his fever, the people who watched
him might have henrd him raving about Amelin. The idea that he should
never see ler aguin depressed him in his lucid lours. Ie tlought his
last dny was come; and he made his solemn preparations for departure:
setting his affairs in this world in order, and leaving the little property of
whicl he was possessed to those whom he most desired to benefit. The
friend in whose house he was located witnessed his testaent. le desirel
to bc buried with a little brown hair-chain which he wore round his neck,
andl whieh, if the trull must be known, he had got fron Amclia's maid at
Brussels, when tle young widow's hair was cut ofl, during the fever whichl
prostrated her after tle death of George Osborne on the plateau of Mount
St. Jolmn.
He recovered, rallied, relapsed again, having undergone such a process
of blool-letting and calomel as showed the strength of his original consti-
tution. IIe was almost a skeleton when they put him on oard the
Rnmchunder, kEast Indianan, Captain Bragg, from Calcutta touching at
MIndrns; ad so wenk nnd prostrate, tlat his friend who had tended him
throughi his illness, prophesied that the honest Mnjor would never survive
the voyage, und that he would pass some morning, shrouded in flag and
hamock, over the ship's side, and cnrrying down to the sea with him,
the relic that he wore at his heart. lut whether it was the sea air, or
the hope which sprang up in im afresh, from the dsy that the ship spread
hwer canvass and stood out of the ronds towards ome, our friend began
to nmend, and he was quite well (though as gaunt ns a greyhound) before
they reuchel the Cnpe. `` Kirk will be disuappointel of' his majority
this time,'' he said with a smile ``he will expect to find limself gazetted
ly the time the regiment renches lome.'' For it must be preised
tht while the Mnjnr was lying ill at Mndras, haing made such a
proligious haste to go thither, the gallant -th wlich had passed many
years nbrond, which afer its return from thie West Indies lad beenu baulked
of its stay at home by the Waterloo campaign, and had been ordered
from Flanders to Indin, hnd received orders home; and the Major might
have accompanied his comrades, had he chosen to wait for their arrival
at Madrns.
TPerhaps he was ot inelined to put himself in his exhausted state again

nnder the guardianshin of Glorvinn. : I think Miss O'Dowd would hnve
done for me,'' he said, langhingly, to a fellow-passenger, ` if we hnd had
her on board, and when she had sunk me, she would have fallen upon you,
depend upon it, and carried you in as a prize to Southampton, Jos, my
boy.''
For indeed it was no other than our stout friend who was also a pns-
senger on board the Ramchunder. He had passed ten years in Bengal.-
Constant dinners, tiffins, pale ale and claret, the prodigious labours of
cutcherry, and the refreshment of brandy-pawnee which he was forcel to
take there, hal their efect upon Waterloo Sedley. A voyage to Europe
was pronounced necessary for him-nud having served his full time in
Indin, and had fine appointmeuts which had enabled him to lay by a con-
siderable sum of money, he was free to come home and stay with a good
pension, or to return and resume that rank in his service to which his
seniority and his vast talents entitled him.
He wns rather thinner thn when we last saw him, but had gained in
majesty and solemnity of demennour. He hnd resumed the moustnchios
to which his services at Waterloo entitlel him, and swaggered about on
deck in a magnificent velet cap with a gold band, nd a profuse orna-
mentation of pins and jewellery about his person. IIe took breakfast in
his cabin, and dressed as solemnly to appear on the quarter-deck, as if he
was going to turn out for Bond Street, or the Course at Calcutta. He
brought a natire servnnt with him, who was his vulet and pipe-bearer;
nnd who wore the Sedley erest in silver on his turban. That oriental
menial had a wretched life under the tyranny of Jos Sedley. Jos was as
vnin of his person as n woman, and took as long a time at his toilette as
nny fading beauty. The youngsters among the psssengers, oung Chaffers
of the 150th, and poor little licketts, coming home after his third fever,
nsed to draw out Sedley at the cuddy-table, and make him tell prodigious
stories about himself nnl his exploits against tigers and Napoleon. He
was great when he visitel the Emperor's tomb at Longwood, when to these
gentlemen and the young officers of the ship, Mnjor Dobbin not being by, he
deseribel the whole Battle of Waterloo, and all but announeed that Napo-
leon never would hae gone to Saint IIelena at all but for him, Jos Sedley.
After leaving St. Helena he becnme very generous, disposing of a great
quantity of ship stores, claret, preserved meats, and great casks packed
with soda-wnter, brought out for his private delectation. There were no
ladics on boarl; the Mnjor guve the pas of precedency to the civilian,
so thmat he was the first dignitry at table; and treated by Cnptain
Bragg, and the officers of the Ramchunler, with the respect which his
rank warranted. IIe disappearel rather in a panic during a two-days'
gale, in which he had the portholes of his cabin battened down; nnd
remnined in his cot reading the Washerwoman of Finclley Common, left
on board the Ramchunder by the Right Honounrable the Laly Emily
Horblower, wife of the Re. Silas Hornblower, then on their passage out
to the Cape, where tho Reverend gentleman wns a missionary ; but, for
common reading, he had brought a stock of novels and plays which he
lent to the rest of the ship, and rendered himself agreeable to all by
his kindness and condescension.

In these conersations it was wonlerful with what perseverance and
ingenuity Major Dobbin would unage to bring the talk round to the
subjeet of Amelia anl her little boy. Jos, a little testy about his father'
misfortunes and unceremonious applications to him, was soothed down by
the Major, who pointed out the elder's ill fortunes and old age. He
would not perhaps like to live with the old couple: whose ways and
hours might not agree with those of a younger man, aceustomed to different

society, (Jos bowed ant this compliment) : but, the Mfnjor pointed out, how
advantageous it would be for Jos Sedley to have a house of his own in
London, and not a mere bachelor's estublishlent as before; how his sister
Amelia would be the very person to preside over it; how clegant, how
gentle she wns, and of what refiued good manners. He recounted stories
of the success which Mrs. Georgc Osborne had had in former days at
Brussells, and in London, where she was much admired by people of ery
great fashion: and he then hinted how becoming it would be for Jos to
send Georgy to a good school and make a man of him; for his mother
nnd her pnrents would be sure to spoil him. In a word this artful Major
made the civilian promise to tauke charge of Amelia nnd her unprotected
child. He did not know as yet what events had happenel in the littlo
Selley family; and how denth had removed the mother, and riches had
carried off George from Amelia. But the fact is that every day and
nlways, this love-smitten and middle-nged gentleman was thinking about
Mrs. Osborue, and lis whole henrt was bent upon doing her good. He
coaxed, wheelled, cnjoled, nd complimented Jos 5edley with a persever-
nnce and cordiality of which he was not nware himself, very likely : but
some men who have unmarried sisters or daughters even, may remember
how uncominonly agreeable gentlemen are to the male relations when they
nre courting the females; and perlaps this rogue of n Dobbin was urged
by a similar hypocrisy.
The truth is, wlen Mnjor Dohbin cme on bonrd the Ramchunder,
very sick, and for the three days she lny in the MIadras Rouds, e did not
begin to rally, nor did even thue appearance nnd recognition of his old
aequaintance, MIr. Sedlcy, on board uch cheer him, until after a coner-
sation which they hnd one day, as tle Major was laid lnguidly on the
deck. He said then ho thought he was doomed; he had left a little
something to lis godson in his will; and hc trusted Mrs. Osborne would
remember him kindly, and be hppy in the marriage she was about to
make. ` MarriedP not the lenst,'' Jos answered; `' he had heard Irom
her; sho made no mention of the marriage, and by tho way, it was curious,
she wrote to say that MIajor Dobbin was goiug to be mnrried, and hoped
that e would be hasppy,'' What wcere the dntes of Sedley's letters from
Europe: 1he civilian fetched thcm. hey were two months' later than
the Mnjor's; and the ship's surgcon congratulated himself upon the treat-
ment adopted by him towards his new patient, who had been consigned
to ship-board by the Madras practitioner with very small hopes indeed;
for, from tht day, the very day that he changed the draught, Mjor bobbin
bcgan to mend. Mnd thus it was that deserving oflicer, Captain Nirk,
was lisappointed of his mnjority.
After they psssel St. llclena, Mnjor Dobbin's gaiety nnl strengtl as
such as to astonish all his fellow-pnassengers. Ile luarked with the mid-
shipmen, plyed single-stick with the mates, ran up the shrouds like a boy,
sang a comic song one night to the amusement of the whiole party ussem-
hled over their grog after supper, and rendered himself so gny, lively, and
nmiable, that even Captain bragg, who thought there wns nothing in his
passenger, and considered he was n poor-spirited feller nt first, was con-
strained to own thmt the Major was a reserved but well-informed and

bBragg showed that he possessed discrimination as a man, as well as ability

But s calm taking place when the Ramchunder was within ten days' sail

UR Mjor had rendered himself
so popular on board the Ram-
chuuder, that when he and Mr.
Sedley descended into the welcome
shore-bont which was to take them
from the ship, the whole crew,
men and officers, the great Cap-
tain lragg himself leading off,
gave three cheers for MIajor Dob-
bin, who blushed ery much, and
ducked his head in token of thanks.
Jos who very likely thought the
cheers were for himself, took off
his goll-laced cap and wavel it
najestically to his friends, and
they were pulled to shore and
lnnled with great dignity at the
pier, whenee they proceeded to the

nnd was no sooner at Southampton than he wished to be on the road to
London. Jos, however, would no hear of moving that eveniag. Why
was he to pass anight in a post-chaise instead of a great large undulating
downy featherbed which was there ready to replace the horrid littlenarrow
crib in which the portly Bengal gentleman hal been confined during the
oyage? He could not think of moving till his boggage was cleared, or
of travelling until he could do so with his chillum. So the Major was
forced to wait over that night, and dispatched a letter to lis family an-
nouneing his arrival; entreating from Jos a promise to write to his own

surgeon, and one or two passengers came and dined with our two gentle-
men at the inn: Jos exerting himself in a sumptuous way in ordering
the linner: nnd promising to go to town the next day with the Major.
The landlord said it did his eyes good to see Mr. Sedley take off his first
pint of porter. If I hal time and dared to enter into digressions, I wonld
write a chnpter about that first pint of porter drunk upon English ground.
Ah, how good it isl It is worth wlile to leave home for a year, just to
enjoy that one draught.
MIajor Dobbin made his appearance the next morning very neatly shaved
and drcessed, according to his wont. Indeed, it was so earls in the
morning, that nobody was up in the house excent that wonderful Boots of

snores of thc various inmates of the house roaring through the corridors
as he creaked about in those dim passeages. Then the sleepless lBoots
went shirking round from door to door, gathering up at each the Bluchers,
Wellingtons, Oxonians, which stood ontsile. Then Jos's natie servant
nrose and began to get ready his master's ponderous dressing apparatus,
and prepare his ookah: tlen the maid servants got up, and meeting the
dark man in the passages shriekel and mistook him for the deil. IIe
nnd bDobbin stumbled over thcir pails in the passages as they were
sceouring the deeks of the Royal George. When the first unshormn waiter
appcared and unbarrced the door of the inn, the Major thought that the
tie for departure was arrivel, and ordered s post-chaise to be fetched
instantly, that they might set off.
IIe then directed his steps to MIr. Sedley's room, and opened the
curtains of the grcat large family bed wherein Mr. Jos was snoring. `Come,
up: Sedley,'' the Major said, ' it's time to be off'; the claise will be at
tlie door in half an hour.''
Jos growled from under the counterpane to know what the time was;
buet whcn he at last extorted from the blushing Major (who never told fibs,
however much they might be to his adantage) what was the real hour of
the morning, he broke out into a volley of bad language, which we will
not repeat here, but by which he gave Dobbin to understand that he
would jeopardy his soul if he got up at that moment, tht the Major
might go anl bc hanged, thmat he woul not travel with Dobbin, and tlt
it wns most uukind and ungentlemanlike to disturb a man out of his sleep
in that way: on which the discomfited Major was obliged to retreat,
leaving Jos to resume his interrupted slumbers.
1he chaise came up presently, and the Mnjor would wait no longer.
If he had been an English noblemuan travelling on a plensure tour; ora
newspaper courier, bearing dispatches, (government messages are generally
carried uch more quietiy) he could not have traelled more quickly. The
post boys wondered at the feces he flung amongst them. Ilow happy
nnd green the country looked ans the chaise wlirled rapidly from mile-
stone to mile-stone, through neat country towns where Iandlords came
out to welcome him with smiles and bows; by pretty rod-side inns,
where the signs hung on the elms, and horses and waggoners were
lrinking under the chequered shadow of the trees; by old hnlls anl

Slaughter's, whither he drove faithfully. Long yeara had passed since ho
nw it last, since he and George, as youing men, had enjoyed many a feust,
and held many a revel there. He had now passed into the stage of oll-
fellows-hool. His hair was grizzled, and many n passion and feeiing of
lis youth had grown grey in that interval. There, howcver, stood the old
waiter at the door in the same greasy black suit, with the sue louble clin
and flaccid face, with the same huge bunch of senls at his fob, rattling his
money in his pockets us before, nnd receiving the Major as if he had gonc
away only a week ago. ` Put the Major's things in twety-tlrcee, that's

them in his youth.

in the direction of Brompton,
Every minute ineident of his last meeting with Amelia was present to
the constant man's mind ns he walked towards her house. The arch and
the Achilles statue were up since he had last been in Piccadilly; a hundred
changes had occurred which his eye and mind vaguely noted. He began
to tremble as he walked up the lane from Brompton, that well remembered
lane lending to the street where she lived. Wass she going to be married
or not ? If he were to meet her with the little boy-Good God, what
should he do% He saw a woman coming to him with a ehild of five years
old-was that sheP IIe began to slake at the mere possibility. When
he came up to the row of houses, at last, where she lived, and to the gate,
he caught hold of it and paused. He might have heard the thumping of
his own heart. `'May God Almighty bless her, whateer has happened,''
he thought to himselft. Pshal she may be gone from here,'' he said,
and went in through the gate.
The window of the parlour which she used to oceupy was open,
annd there were no inmates in the room. The Msjor thought he
reeognised the piano though, with the picture over it, as it used to be
in former days, nnd his perturbations were renewed. Mr. Clapp's brass
plate was still on the door; at the knocker of which Dohbin performed a
A buxom-looking lass of sixteen, with bright eyes and purple cheeks,

A NOVEL WITKOUT A HERB0O.

The landlord and landlaty of the house led the worthy Nsjor into the
Bedleys' room (whereof he remembered every single article of furniture,
from the old brass ornamented piano, once a atty little instrument, Sto-
thard maker, to the screens and the alabaster miniature-tombstone, in the
midat of which ticked Mr. Sedley's gold watch), and there as he sat down
in the lodger's vacant arm-chair, the fnther, the mother, and the daughter,
with a thousand ejaculatory breaks in the narrative, informed Major Dobbin
of what we know already, but of particulars in Amelia's history of which
he was not aware-namely, of Mrs. Sedley's denth, of Gcorge's reconcile-
ment with his grandfather Oaborne, of the way in which the widow took
on at leaving him, and of other particulars of her lif. Twice or thrice
he was going to ask about the marriage-portion, but his henrt failed him.
He did not care to lay it bare to these people. Finally, e was infored
thnt Mrs. O. was gone to walk with her Pa iu Keusington Gardens,
whither she always went with the old gentleman (who was very weak and
peevish now, and led her a sd life, though she behaved to him like an
angel, to be sure,) of a fine nfternoon nfter dinner.
eI 'm very much pressed for time,'' the hlajor said, `' and have business
to-night of importance. I should like to see Mrs. Osborne tho'. Suppose
Miss Polly would come with me and show me the wuy.''
Miss Polly was charmed aud a-tnishd at this proposal. `` She kncw
the way. She would show hMajor ollin. she had olten heen witl MIr.

and appearcd presently in her hest bonet nd her mama's yellow shuawl
and large pcbble broocl, of which slc assel the loau in order to makc
herself a worthy compauian for the Major.,

How did sle benr it: Did sle see him oltn: Wu Mr. Sedley pretty
comfortable now in n worldly point of viewP Tolly answered all these
questions of Mlajor Sugnrplums to the very best af her power.
And in the midstof their walk an incidcnt occurred wvhich, though very
simple in its nature, was productive of the greatest delight to MIajor bobbin.
A pale young man with fecble whiskers and astiff white neckeloth came
walking down the lane, en sadil :-having asludy, that is, on each arm.
One was a tall and commanding middle-aged fenale, ith fcatures and a
complesion simnilar to those ol the clergymanof tle Chael ol Ingland by
wlose side she arched, and the other a stunted little womm with a dark
face, ornamented by a fine ncw bonnet and wlite ribbons, and in a smart
pelisse with a rich gold watch in the midst of her person. lhe gentleman,
pinioned ns he was by these two ladies, carried further a parasol, shnwl,
and basket, so that his arms were eutirely engaged, and of course he was
unable to touch his hat in acknowledgmeut of the curtsey with which Miss
Mary Olapp greeted him.
He meekly bowed his head in reply to her salutation, wlich the two

lnlies relurned in a patronising air, and at the same time looking severely
at the individual in the blue coat and bamboo cane, who accompanied
Miss Polly.
 WIo's that,'' asked the Major, amused by the group, and after he had
made way for the tlree to pass up the lane. MIary looked at him rather
roguishly.
e That is onr curate, the Reverend Mr. Binney, (a twiteh from Mjor
obbin), anl his sister Miss B. Lord bless us, how she did use to worret
us ut Sunlay-school; nud the other lady, the little one with a cst in her
eye, and the handsoe watch, is MIrs. Binney-Mliss Grits that was; her
Pa was a grocer, anl kept the Little Original Gold Tcn Pot in Kensington
Gravel Pite. They were married last month, and arc just come baek from
Margate. She's iive thousaud pound to her fortune; but her and Miss B.,
who de the match, have quarrelled alrealy,''
If the MInjor had twitched before, he started now, and slapped the
Imboo on the ground with an emphasis which made Miss Clapp cry,
`Inw,'' nnd laugh too. lIe stool for a moment silent with open mouth
looking nfter the retreating young couple, while Mliss Mary told their history;
ht hc did not henr beyond the announcement of the reverend gentleman's
uarriage; his hceal was swimming with felicity. After this rencontre he
began to walk doble quick towards the place of his destination; and
yct they were too soon (for he was in a great tremor at the iden of a
meeting for which he lad been longing any time thesc ten years)-through
the bBroupton lanes, aud entering at the little old portal in Kensington
Garden wall.
 There they are,'' said Miss Polly,'' and she felt him agin start baek
on her arm. She was a confidante nt once of the whole business. She
knew the story as well as if she had rend it in one of her favourite noel-
books-` Fatherless Fanny,'' or the `` Scottish Chiefs.''
Suppose you were to run on and tell her,'' the Major said. Polly rn
forward, her yellow shawl streaming in the breeze.
Old Selley was seatedl on a bench, his handkerchief placed oer his
knees, prattling away according to his wont, with some old story about
old times, to which Amnelia had listened, and awardel a patient asmile
many a time before. Sle could of late think of her own affairs, and smile
or make other marks of recognition of her father's atories, without scarcel
hcaring a word of the old man's tnles. As Mnr came bouncing along,
anl Amelia caught sight of her, she started np from her beneh. HIer first
thougt was, that something had happened :o Georgy; but the sight of
the messenger's eager and bnppy face dissipated that- fear in te timorous
nother's bosom.
 Nows Necws:'' cried the emissary of Mnjor Dobbin. e Ho'a
conc He's comel
WYIo is come:'' snid Emmy, still thinking of her son.
 Look there,'' nuswered Miss Clapp, turuing round and pointing; in
whieh direction Mmelia looking, saw Dobbin's lean figure and long shadow
stnlking aeross the grass. Amelia astarted in her turn, blushed up, and,
of course, bgn to cry. At all this simple little creature's Ites, tha
grandes eau were aceustomed to play.

IIe looked at her-oh, how fondly-as she came running towards him,
her hands before her, ready to give them to him. She was'nt clnged.
She was a little pale: a little stouter in figure. Her eyes were the same,
the kind trustful eyes. There were scarce three lines of silver in her soft
brown hair. She gave lim both her hands as she looked up flushing and
smiling through her tenrs into his honest homely ace. He took the two
little hands between his two, and held them there. He was speeclless
for a moment. Why did he not tnke her in lis urms, and swcnr that he
would never lenve her? She must lave yielded: she could not but have
obeyed him.
 I-I1've another arrival to announce,'' he said, aftcr a pause.
 Mre. Dobbin '' Anelia said, making a movemneut baek-Why didn't
he speak
 No,'' he said, letting her hands go: : Who has told you those lies:
-I mean, your brother Jos came in tle same slip with me, and is come
home to make you nll happy.''
 Pape, papa1'' Emmy cried out, `'here are newsl My brother is in
England. He is come to take care of you.-llere is Major Dobbin.''
Mr. Sedley startel up, slaking a great deal, anl gathering up his
thoughts. 1hen hc stepped forwnrd and mnde an old-fashioned low to
tle Major, whom he called Mlr. Dobbin, and hopel his worthy father, Sir
William, was quite well. lIle proposed to call upon Sir Willia, who hnd
done him the honour of a visit a short time ago. Sir WWilliam had not
called upon the old gentleman for eight years-it was tht visit he wus
thinking of rcturning.
He is very much ehaken,'' Emmy whispered, as Dobbin went up and
cordially shook hands with the old man.
Although he had such particular business in London that evening, the
Major consented to forego it upon Mr. Sedley's invitation to him to coms
home and partake of tea. Ameliu put her arm under that of her young
friend with the yellow shawl, and headed the party on their return home-
wards, so that Mr. Sedley fell to Dobbin's share. The old man walkel
very alowly, and told a number of ancient histories about himself and his
poor Bessy, his former prosperity, and his bankruptcy. IIis thoughts, as
is usual witl failing old men, were quite in former times. The past,
with the exception of the one catastrophe which he felt, he knew little
nabout. he Mjor was glad to let him talk on. His eyes were fixed
upon the figure in front of him-the der little figure always prcsent
to his imagination and in his prayers, and visiting his dreams wakeful or
alumbering.
Amelia was very happy, smiling, and active all that evening; performing
her duties ns hostess of the little entecrtainment with the utmost graee and
propriety, as Dobbin thought. IIis eycs followed her about as they sute
in the twilight. How many a time had he longed for that moment, and
thought of her far away under hot winds nnd in weary marches, gentle nud
happy, kindly ministering to the wants of old age, and decorating poverty
with sweet submission-as he snw her now. I do not say that his taste
was the highest or that it is thc duty of great intellects to be content with
a bread-and-butter paradise, such as sufficed our simple old friend ; but
528
vAIF AIR.
his desires were of this sort whether for good or bad ; and, with Amelia to
elp him, he was as ready to drink as many cups of tea nss Doctor Johnuson.
Amelia seeing this propensity, laughingly encouraged it; and looked
exceedingly roguish as she administered to him cup after cup. It is true
she did not know that the Major had had no dinner, and that the cloth
was lail for him at the Slaughter's, and a plate laid thereon to mark that
the table was retained, in that very box in which the Msjor nnd George
had sate many a time carousing, when she was a child just come home
from Miss Pinkerton's school.
The first thing Mrs. Oshorne showed the Major was Georgy's miniature,
for which she ran up stairs on her arrival ut home. It was not half hand-
some enough of course for the boy, but wasn't ithoblec of him to think of
bringing it to his motherP Whilst her papa was awke she did not talk
much about Gcorgy. To hcear about Mr. Osborne and Russell Square was
not agreeable to the old man, who very likely was uneonscious that he had
been living for some months past mainly on the bounty of his richer rival;
annd lost his temper if allnsion was made to tho other.
Dobbin told him all, nnd n little more perhaps thun all, that had happened
on bonrd the Ramchunder; and exaggerated Jos's benevolent dispositions
towards his father, and resolution to make him eomfortable in his old
dnys. The truth is that during the voyage the Major had impressed this
uty most strongly upon his fellow-passenger and extorted promises frorm
himn that he would take charge of his sister and ler child. He soothed
Jos's irritation with regnrd to the billa which tle old gentleman had
drawn upon him, gave a laughing account of his own suferings on the
same score, and of the famous consignment of wine with which the old
man had f:voured him: nnd brought Mr. Jos, who was by no means an
ill-naturcd person when well pleased and moderately flattered, to a ery
good state of fecling regarling his relatives in Europe.
And in fine I am aslamed t say that the Mjor stretchel the truth so
fuar as to tell old Mr. Selley that it was mainly a desiro to see his parent
which brought Jos onee more to Eurone.
At. his aceustomed hour Mr. Selley began to dose in his chair, and
then it was Amceliu's opportunity to commence her conversation whieh
she did with great eagerness;-it related exclusively to Georgy. She
lid not talk at all about her own sufferiugs at breaking from him, for
indeel this wortlhy womnn, though she wns half-killed by the separation
from the child, yet thought it was ery wicked in her to repine at losing
lim; but everything concerning him, his virtues, talents, and prospects,
she poured out. Shc described his angelie beauty; narrated a hunlrel
instances of his generosity and greatness of mind whilst living with her:
how a Royal Duchess had stopped and admirel him in Kensington
Gardens ; how splendidly he was cnred for now, and how he had a groom
nd a ony; what quickness and cleverness e ha, nnd what a prodi-
giously well-rcad and delightful person the Reverend Lawrenee Vel was,

no place in the bar or the senate that Georgy may not aspire to. Look

composition. This great effort of genius, wlich is still in the possession
of George's mother, is as follows:
On Selfslness.-Of all the vices which degrale the human character,
Selfishness is the most odious and contemptible. An undue love of Self
leads to the most monstrous crimes; and oceasions the greatest misfortuncs
both in States and Families. As a selfish man will impoverish his fumily
and often bring them to ruin: so a selfish king brings ruin on his people
and often plunges tlem into war.
Examnple: The selfishess of Achilles, as remarked by the poet IIomer,
occasioned a thousand woes to the Grecks-uvpi  Ayois hy' E6dne-
(IIom. Il. A. 2). The selfishness of the late Napoleon Bonaparte oces-
sioned innumerable wars in Europe, and caused him to perish, himself, in
a miserable island-that of Saint Helena in the htlantic Ocean.

passed rapilly through William's mind, as he was holding Amelia's hand,
whilst the haundkerchief wns veiling ler eycs.
Dear friend,'' she snid, pressing the hand which held hers, ` IIow

:Not to-morrow,'' said poor old Dobbin. ` I huve business.'' He
lid not like to own that he had not as yet been to lis puarents' and is dcar
sister Anne-a remissness for which l am sure every well-regulated person
will blame the Mjor. Aul presently ho took his leave, leaving his ddress
behind him for Jos, against the latter's arrival. And so the firt day was
over, and he had seen her.
When he got back to the Slaughter's, the ronst fowl was of course cold,
in which condition he ate it for supper. And knowing what early hours
his family kept, anl that it would be ncedless to disturb their slumbers at
so late an hour, it is on reeord, thut MInjor Dobbin treated himself to hulf-

old Selley eovered them carefully over with a clean handanna handkerechief,
(one out of Maior Dobbin's lot), and enjoined the maid and landlady of the

arranged for the arrival of Mr. Joseph Sedley the next morning, ``Mr.

and tiei the old man's neckcloth in a smart bow, and put his brooch intao
his best shirt frill, in wlich, in his Sunday sit of mourning, he sat from
six o'clock in the morning awniting the arrival of his son.
There are some splendid tailors' shops in the High Street of outhampton,
 M 
vANIT FAIR.
in the fine plate-glass winlows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all
sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last new
fashions in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and
holding on to little boys with the exseeeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle
ladies in riding habits prancing by the Statue of Achilles at Apsley House.
Jos, although provided with some of the most splendid vests that Calcutta
could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with
one or two of these garments, and selected a erimson satin, embroidered
with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes
and a rolling collar, with which, and a rich blue satin stock and a gold pin,
consisting of a five-barred gatc with n horseman in pink enamel jumping
over it, he thought he might make his entry into London withi some
dignity. For Jos's former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had
given way to a more candid and courageous self-assertion of his worth.,
I don't care about owning it,'' Waterloo Sedley would say to li
friends, '`I am a dressy man:'' and though rather uneasy if the lalies
looked at him at the Government House balls, and though he blushed
and turned away alarmed under their glanees, it was chiefly from a
dread Icst they should make love to him, that he aoided them, being
nverse to marriage altogether. But there was no such swell in Cnl-
cutta as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say: nnl he had the hndsomest
turn-out, gave the best bachelor dinners, and had the finest plate in the
whole place.
To make these waiscoats for a man of his size and dignity took at least
a day, part of which he emnployed in liring a servant to wait upon him
nnd his native; and in instructiug the ageut who cleared his baggage,
his boxes, his books, which he never read; his chests of mangoes, chutney,
and currie-powders; his shawls for presents to people whom he didn't
know as yet; and the rest of his Perieos apparatne.
At lengtl, he lrove leisurely to London on the third day, and in
the ne waistcoat. The native, with chattering teeth, shuddering in a
shwl on the box by the side of the new ELuropenn servant, Jos puffing his
pipe at intervals within, and looking so majeastic, thut little boys cried
IIooray, anl many people thought he must be n Governor-Gcneral. 
I promise, did not decline thc obsequious invitation of the landlords to
nlight and refresh himself in the nent country towns. Having partaken of
a copious breakfast, with fish, and rice, and hard eggs, at Southampton,
he had so far rallied at WYinehester as to think a glass of slerry necessary.
At Alton he stepped out of the cnrriage, at his servant's requcst, and
ibibed some of the ale for which thec place is famons. At Furuha he
stopped to vicw the Bishop's Castle, and to partake of a light dinner of
stewed cels, veal cutlets, anl French beans, with n bottle of claret. He
was cold over Bagslot Henth, where the native chattered more aund more,
and Jos Sahib took some brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into
town, he was as full of wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and
tobaceo, as the steward's cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening wlen
his carriage thundered up to the little door in Brompton, whither the
affectionate fellow drove first, and before hying to the apartments secured
for him hy Mr. Dobbin at the 9laughter's.

A NOYEL WITEODT A HER0.
533
All the faces in the street were in the windows; the little maid-servant
flew to the wicket-gate, the Mesdames Clapp looked out from the casement
of the ornmented kitchen; kEmmy, in n grent flutter, was in the passage
nmoug the hats anl coats, and old Selley in the purlour inside, shaking all
over. Jos descended from the post-chaise and down the creaking swaying
steps in awful state, supported by the new valet from Southampton and
the shuddering native, whose brown face was now livid with cold, and of
the colour of a turkey's gizzard. He ereated an immense sensation in the
passnge presently, where Mrs. and Miss Clapp, coming perhaps to listen
nt the parlour door, found ILoll Jewal shaking upon the hall-bench under
the couts, moaning in a strange piteous way, and showing his yellow
eyeballs annd wlite tceth.
For, you see, we have adroitly shut the door upon the meeting between
Jos und the old father, nnd the poor littlec gentle siater insile. hoe old
man was very muel affectcd: so, of courae, was his dauhter: nor was
Jos without feeling. In thuat long abence of ten years, the most selfish
will think about home and early ties. IBftancee sunctifies both. Long
brooding over those lost pleasnures exaggcrates their chnrm and sweetness.
Ios was unaffectedly glad to see and shake tle hand of his futher, between
whom and himel there hud been a coolncss-glad to see his little sister,
whom he remembered so prctty and smiling, antl painel at the alteration
which time, grief,. uand misfortme had malc 'in the shttered old man.
Emmy had come out to the door in her. blaek elothes and whisepered to
him of her mother's deuth, nnl not to speak of it to thei father. hIare
was no need of this caution, for tho clder Seley himself hggan immediately
to speak of the event, aud nrnttlud about it,antd wept ve it plenteously.
It shocked the Indian not n little, and made him tlink of himself less than
the poor fellow was accustomed to do.
The result of the interview must have ben very stiffnctory, for when
Jos had reascendcd his post-chaise, nnd hail driven awayto his lotel, Ermy
emhraced her father tcnderly, appealing to him with an ir of triumph, and
asking the old man whether sho did not lways say that her brother had a
good heart
Indeed, Joseph Seiley, afftecte by the humble position in wich he
found his relations, and in tlo expansiseness and osloying of heart
oceasionel by the first meetiug, declaed thnt they shouladfivcr suffer want
or discomfort any more, tht h wns ht home for somolme al any rate,
during whicl his house and cverithing he had should beirs; and that
Amelia would look very pretty at the hend of his table--atil-she would

abcept one of her own.
.L.
She shook her hend sadly, and had, ns usual, recourse to the water-
works. She knew whnt he meant. She nnd her young confidante, Miss
Mnry, had talked over the matter most fully, the very night of the Mujor'a
visit; beyond which timwe the impetuous Polly coull not refrain from talk-
ing of the discovery which she hmnd made, nd leseribiug the start and
tremor of joy by whiel Mjor Dobbin etrayed himnself whcn MIr. Binney

if he was married, and he said,  Who told you those lies2' O Mas'am,''
Polly said, ``he never kept his eyes off you; and I 'm sure he's grown
grey a-thinking of you.''
But Amelia, looking up at her bed, over which hung the portraits of
her husband and son, told hcr young proteee, never, never, to speak on
that subject again; thnt Major Dobbin had been her husband's dearest
frienl, and ler own and George's most kind and affectionate guardian;
thnt she loved him as a brother-but that a woman who had been married
to such u angel as that, and she pointed to the wall, could never think of
nny other union. Poor Polly sighed: she thought what she should do if
young Mr. Tomkins, at the Surgery, who always looked at her so at
church, and who, by those mere aggrcssive glanees had put ler timorous
little heart into such a flutter thnt she was ready to surrender at once,-
what she should do if he were to die She knew he was consumptie,
his checks were so red, and he was so uncommon thin in the waist.
Not thnt Emny, being mnde nware of the honest Major's passion,
rebuffcl him in any way, or felt displeascd with him. Sueh an attach-
uent from so true and loyal a gentleman could mnke no woman angry.
Desdemona was not angry with Cussio, though there is very little loubt
she saw the Lieutenant's partiality for her (nnd I for my part believe that
mnny more things took place in that sad affair than the worthy Moorish
officer ever knew of); why, Mirnnda was even very kind to Culiban, and we
may bc pretty sure for the same reason. Not thnt she would encourage him
in the lenst,-the poor uncouth monster-of course not. No more would
Emmy by any means encourage her admirer, the Major. She would give
him that friendly regard, which so much excellencee and fidelity merited;
she would treat lim with perfect cordinlity and frankness until he male
his proposals; and tlen it would be time enough for her to spesk, and to
put an end to hopes which never could be realised.
She slept, therefore, very sounlly that eening, after the conversation
with Miss Polly, and was more than ordinarily happy, in spite of Jos's
delaying. ''I am glal he is not going to rry thuat Miss O'Dowd,'' she
tlougrlt.  Colonel O'Dowd never could have a sister fit for such an
ncconplished mnn us Major William,'' Who wns there amongst her little
cirele, who would mnuke him a good wife? Not MIiss Binney, she was too
old nnl ill-tempered; Miss Osborne :-too old too. Little Polly was too
young. Mrs. Osborne could not find anybody to suit the Mjor befors
she went to slecp.
IIowever when the postman made his appearnce, the little party were
put out of suspense, by the receipt of a letter from Jos to his sister, who
aunounced, that he felt alittle futigued after his voyage, and should not be
nble to move on that day, but that he would leave Southampton early the
ext morning, and bo with his fther and mother at evening. Amelia as
she read out the letter to her father, paused over the latter word; her
bother, it was clear, did not know what hal happened in the fnmily.
Nor could he: for thc fact is that tlough the Major rightly suspected that
his traclling compnnion never would be got into motion in so short as
apnce as twenty-four hours, and would find some excuse for delaying, yet
Dobbin hal not writteu to Jos to inlform him of tle calamity which hadl

befullen the Scdley family: beiug oceeupicd in talking with Amelia until
long alter post-hour.
The same moruing brought Major Dobbin a letter to the Slaughter'a
Coee lIouse from his friend at Southampton; begging dear Dob to excuse
Jos for bcig in a rage when awakened the duy efore (he lal a confounded
enl-ache, and was just in his first sleep), and entrenting Dob to engage
comfortable rooms at the Slaughter's for Mr. Sedley nnd his servants.
The Major had become necessary to Jos during the voyage. lIe was
attached to him, and hung upon im. Thce other passengers were nway
to London. oung Ricketts and little Chaffers went away on the coaeh
that day-Ricketts on the box, nnd taking the rcins fro Botley; the
Doctor was of to his faily at Portsea;: rugg gone to town to his
co-pasrtners; and the first mate busy in the unloading of the Ramchunder.
Mr. Jos was very lonely nt Southamptou, and got the lanlord of the
George to take a glass of wine with him that day; at the very hour nt
which Mjor Dobbin was seatel at the table of his father, ir William, where
his sister found out (for it was impossible for the Major to tell fibs) that
he had bcen to see Mlrs. George Osborne.
Jos wus so comfortably situated in Sainut Martin's Lane, le could enjoy
is hookah there with such perfect case, anl ccull swagger down to the
theatrcs, when minded, so agreeably, that, perhaps, he would lave
remnincl altogether at the Slaughter's had not his friend, the Major, bcen
at his clbow. That geutleman would not let the lengalee rest until he
lad executed his promise of having a lome for hmelia and his father. Jos
was a soft fellow in anybody's hands; Dobin most active in anybody's
concerns but his own; the civilian was, therefore, an easy victim to tle
guilcless arts of this good-natured diplomalist, and was rendy to do, to
purchase, hire, or relinquish whateer his fricnd thought fit. Loll Jewab,
of whom the boys about Snint Martin's Lane used to make crucl fun
whenever he showed his dusky countenance in the street, was sent bnck tu
Calcutta in the Lady Kicklebury Lnst Indiuman, in which Sir William
Dobbin had a share; having previously taught Jos's European the art of
prceparing curries, pilaws, and pipes. It was a matter of greut delight
and occupation to Jos to superintcnd the building of a smart chariot,
wich he and the Major ordered in tle neighbouring Long hAere: and a pair
of hnndsome horses were jobbcd, with which Jos drove about in state in
the Park, or to call upon his Indian friends. Amelia was uot seldom by
his side on these excursions, when also MIjor Dobbin would be scen in
the back seat of the carriage. At othcr ties Old Seley and his daughter
took advantuage of it: and Miss Clapp, who frequently accompanicd er
fricnd, had grcat pleasure in being recognised ans she sate in thc carriage,
dressed in the famous yellow shawl, by the young gentleman at the surgesy,
whose face might commouly be seen over te window-blinds as she passed.
Bhortly after Jos's first nppearance at Brompton, a dismal scene, indeed,
took placc nt that humble cottage, at which the Sedleys had passed tle
last ten ycars of their life. Jos's carriage (the temporary one, not the
chariot under construetion) arrived one day and carried off old Sedley
and his daughter-to return no more. The tears that were shed by tha

lndlady and the landlady's daughter at that event were as genuine tears
of sorrow as any that have been outpoured in the course of this history.
In their long aequaintanceeship and intimacy they could not recall a harsh
word that hnd bcen uttered by Amelin. Sho hnd been all sweetness and
kindness, always thankful, always gentle, even when MIrs. Clapp lost her
own temper, and pressed for the rent. When the kind creature was going
away for good and all, the landlady reproached herself bitterly for erer
having used a rough expression to her-how she wept, as they stuck up
with wafers on the window, a paper notifying that the little rooms so
long occupied were to let1 They never would have such lodgers again,
tht was quite clear. After-life proved the truth of this melancholy pro-
phecy: and Mrs. Clapp revenged herself for the deterioration of mankind
by levying the most savage contributions upon the tea-caddies and legs
of mutton of her locataires. Most of them scolded and grumbled; some
of thcm did not pay: none of them stayed. The lundlady might well
regret those old, olt friends, who had left her.
As for Miiss Mary, her sorrow at Ameli's departure was such as I shall
not attempt to denict. From childhood upwards sle had been with her
daily, nnd hnd attached herself so passionately to that denr good lady, that
when the grand bnrouche came to carry her off into splendour, she fainte
in the arns of her friend, who was indeel scarcely less affectcd than the
good-natured girl. Amelia loved her like a daughter. During cleven
years the girl had bccn her constant friend nnd associate. The senaration
was a very painful one indeel to her. But it was of course arranged that
Mary wns to come and stay often at the grand new house whither MIrs.
Osborne was going; and where Mary was sure she would never e so
hnppy as she had been in their humble cotas Miss Clapn called it in the
language of the novels which she loved.
Let us hopc she was wrong in hcr judgment. Poor Emy's days of
lappincss had been very few in that huble cot. A gloomy ate had
oppressed her there, She never liked to come back to the louse after
he had lcft it, or to fuace the landlady who had tyrannisel over her when
ill-humoured nnd unpaid; or when plcasel had treetcd her with a conarse
familiarity searcely less odiou. Her servility and fulsomc compliments
when Emmy was in prosperity were not more to that lady's liking. She
cast about notes of ndmiration all over thc ne house, cxtolling every
artiele of furniture or ornnment; she fingered MIrs, Osorne's dresses, and
calculatel their price. Nothing coull be too good far thnt sweet lady,
she vowcl and protested. lBut in the vulgar sycophaut who now paid
court to her, Emmy always rememberel the coarse tyrant who had made
her miserable many a time to whomn she had been forced to put up peti-
tions for time, when the rent was overdue; who eried out at her extrara-
gance if she bought lelicncies for her ailing mother or father; who had
seen her humble nnd trampled upon her.
Nobody ever heard of these griefs, which had been part of our poor little
woman's lot in lifc. She kept them secret from her father, whose impro-
vidence wns the cnnse of much of her miser. She hnd to lenr nll the
blame of his misloings, nd indeed wns so utterly gentle and humble as
to be made by nature for n victim.
A NOYEL WITI0U A IIER0.

(
I hope she is ot to suffer mucl more of thnt hard usage. And, as
in all griefs, there is said to be some consolation, I may mention that
poor Mary, wlen left at her friend's doparture in a hysterical condition,
was placed under tho medical treatment of the young fellow fromn the
surgery, under whose care she rallied after a short period. lEmmy, when
she went away from lBrompton, endowed Mnry with every article of furniturc
that the house contained: only taking away her pictures (the two picturcs
over the bed) and her piano-that little old piano which had now passed
into a plaintive jingling old age, but which she lovcd for reasons of ler
own. She was a child when first she played on it: and her pnrents gavo
it her. It had been given to her again since, as the reader may remember,
whoen her father's louse was gone to ruin, and the instrument was recovered
out of the wreek.
Mjor Dobbin was exceedingly pleased when, as he was superintending
the arrangements of Jos's new house, which the Major insisted shonld be
very handsome and comfortable; the cart arrived from Brompton, bringing
the trunks and band-boxes of the emigrants from that village, and with
them the old piano. Amelia would have it up in ler sitting-room, a neat
little apurtment on the second floor, aljoining ler fatler's clamber: and
where the old gentleman sate commonly of evenings.
When the men nppeared thon bearing this old music-box, and Amelia
gve orlers that it should bc placed in the chambcr aforesaid, Dobbin was
quite elatel.  I 'm glad you 've kept i,'' he snid in a very sentimental
manner. '" I was afraid you lid'nt eare about it.''
 I value it more than nnything I have in the world,'' suid Mmelia.
Do you, Amelia?'' cried the Mjor. The fact ws, as he had bought
it himself, though he never said anything about it, it never entered into
his head to suppose that Emmy should thiuk anybody else was the pur-
chaser, and as a mntter of couse, he fuancicd that she knew the gift came
from him. : Do you, Amelia?'' he said; and the question, the gret
=:::::-
 I did not know,'' snil poor old Dob, anl his countenance fell.
Emmy dil not note the circumstance nt tle time, nor take imme-
diate heed of the very dismal expression which honest Dobbin's counte-
nance nssumed; but she thought of it nfterwards. And thcn it struck
her, with inexpressible pain and mortificntion too, that it wns William who
was the giver of the piano; and not George, as shce hnd faneied. It was
not George's gilt; the only one which she had received from her lover, as
she thought-thoe thing she had cherished beomnl all others-her dearest
relic aud prize. She had spokcn to it about Gcorge; played his favouritc
airs upon it; snle for long evcning hours, touching, to the best of her
simple art, melancholy harmonies on the keys, and weeping over them in
silence. It wns not George's relic. It was valueless now. The next
time that old Sedley asked ler to play, she snil it was shockingly out of
tune, that she had a hecudache, thnt shc couldn't play.
Then, uccording to her custo, she rebuked herself for hcr pcttislness
and ingratitude, and detcrined to make a repuaration to honest William
for the slight she hd not espressed to him, but had felt for his piano.
538
vANIFY FAI.
A few days afterwards, as they were seated in the drawing-room, where
Jos had fallen asleep with great comfort after diuner, Amelia said with
rather a faltering voice to Major Dobbin,-
I have to beg your pardon for something.''
 About whatR'' said he.
 About-about that little square piano. I never thanked you for it
when you gave it me; many, many years ago, before I was married. I
thought aomebody else had given it. Thnk you, William.'' She held
out her hand; but the poor little woman's heart was bleeding; and as for
her eyes, of eourse they were at their work,
Bit William could hold no more. ``Amelia, Amelia,'' he said, '` I did buy
it for you. I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved
you from the first minute that I saw you, when George brought me to your
house, to show me the Amelin whom he was engaged to. ou were but a girl,
in white, with large ringlets; you came down singing-do you remember 2
-and we went to Vnuxhall. Since then I hnve thought of but one woman
in the world, and that was you. I tlink there is no hour of the day has
passel for twelve years that I haen't tlought of you. I came to tell yon
this before I went to Indin, but you did not care, and I hadn't the heart
to spek. Iou did not care whether I stayed or went''
I was very ungrateful,'' MAmelia said.
No; only indiflerent,'' Dobbin continued, desperately. I have nothing
to make a woman to be otherwise. I know what you are feeling now.
ou are hurt in your hert at that discovery about the piano; and that it
came from me and not trom George. I forgot, or I should never have
spoken of it so. It is for me to ask your pardon for being a fool for a
moment, and thinking that years of constaney and devotion might hare
pleaded with you.''
It is you who are cruel now,'' Amelia said with some spirit. `` George
is my husband, here and in heaven. How could I love any other but
him? I am his now as when you first saw me, lear William. It was he
who told me how good and generous you were, and who taught me tao
love you as a brother. Hae you not been everything to me and ry boy 
Our learest, truest, kindest, friend and protector Hnd you come a few
months sooner perhaps you might have spared me that-that dreadful
parting. O, it early killed me, William-but you didn't come, though
I wished nnd prayed for you to come, and they took him too awy irom
me. Isn't he a noble boy, William? Be his friend still and mine''-and
hcre her oice broke, and she hid her face on his shoulker.
The Major folded his ars round her, holding her to him as if she was
a chill, and kissel her head.  I will not change, dear Amelia,'' he said.
I ask for no more than your love. I think I wonld not hae it otlher-
wise. Only lel mce stay ear you, and see you often.''
 Ycs, often,'' Amclia sail. And so William was at liberty to look and
leng: as the poor boy at school who has no money may sigh after thc
contents of the tart-woman's tray.

OOD fortune now

circle; not so grand
and refined as that
in which our other

respectable aodes of the retired Indian aristocraey, and the quarter which
Mr, Wenham calls the Blaek Hole, in a word Jos's position in life was
not grand enough to entitle him to a house in Moira Plaee, where none
can live but retired Memhers of Council, and partners of Indian firms (who
break after having settled n hundred thousand pounds on their wives, and
retire into comparuative penury to a country place and four thousand a year):
he engaged a comfortable house of a second or third-rate order in Gil-

npproprinte planned furniture by Seddons, from the assignees of Mr. Scape,
latcly ndrmitted partner into the great Culcuttn House of Fogle, Fake, and
Cracksman, in which poor cape had embarked seenty thousand pounds,
the earnings of a long and honourable life, taking Fake's place, who retired
to a princely Purk in Susses, (the Fogles have been loug out of the firm, and
Sir HIorace Fogle is nbout to be raisel to the peerage as lBnron Bandanna)
-ndmitted, I say, partner into tle great agency house of Fogle and Fakce
two years before it failed for a million, and plunged half the Indian public
into misery and ruin.
Scape, ruined, honest, and broken-hearted nt sixty-five years of age,
went out to Calcutta to wind up the affairs of the house. Walter Scape
wns withdrnwn from Eton, and put into a merclant's honse. Florencec
Bcape, Fanny Scape, and their mother faled away to Boulogne, and will
be heard of no more. To be brief, Jos stepped in and bought their
carpets and sileboards, and adirel himself in the mirrors which had
reflectel their kinl handsome faces. The Scape tradesmen, all honourably
paid, left their cards, and were eager to supply the new household. The
large men in white waistcoats, who waited at cape's inners, green-grocers,
bank-porters, and milkmen in their private capaeity, left their addresses,
anl iugratiated themselves with the butler. Mr. Chummy, the chimney-
purifier, who had swep thc last three families, tried to coax the hutler and
the boy under him, whose duty it was to go out covered with buttons
and with stripes down his trowsers, for the protection of Mrs. Amelia
whenever sle chose to walk abrond.
It was a modest establishment. The butler was Jos's valet also, and
never was more drunk than a butler in a small faily should be who hss
a proper regardl for his master's wine. Enmy was supplied with a maid,
grown on Sir William Dobbin's suburban estate: a good girl, whose
kindness and humility disarmed Mrs. Osborne, who was at first terrified
at the ideas of haing a servant to wait upon herself, who did not in the
least know how to use one, and who always spoketo domestics with the
most reverential politeness. But this maid was very uscful in the family,
in dexterously tending oll Mr. Selley, who kent almost entirely to his own
quarter of the house, and never nixed in any of the gay doings which took
pluce there.
Numbers of people came to see Mrs. Osborne. Lady Dobbin and
laughters were delighted at her change of fortune, and wnited upon hcr.
Miss Osborne from lussell Square came in her grand chariot with the
flaming hammercloth cmnblnzoned with the Leeds arms. Jos was reported
to be immensely ricl. Ol Oshorne had no objection thnt Georgy should
inherit his uncle's property ns well as his own. ` Damn it, we will makea
man of the feller,'' he said; ``and I'Il see him in Pnrliament before I die.
To may go and see is mother, Miss O., though I'll never set eyes on
her:'' and Miss Osborne came. ELmmy, you may be sure, was very glad
to scce her, nnd so bc brought ncarcr to George. That yong fcllow was
allowed to come much more ifrequently than before to visit his mother.

in his demenor when that gentleman as present. He was a clevrer la,
and nfraid of the Major. George could not help admiring his friend's
simplicity, his good-humour, his various learuing quietly imparted, his
general love of truth and justice. He had met no such man as yet in the
course of his exsperience, and he had nn iustinctie liking for a gentleman.
He hung fondly by his god-father's side; and it was his delight to walk in
thc Parks and hear Dobbin talk. William told George about his father,
about Inlia and Waterloo, about everything but himself. When George
was more than usunlly pert and conceited, the Major made jokes at him,
whicl Mrs. Osborne thought very cruel. One day, taking him tothe play,
and the boy declining to go into the pit because it was vulgar, the Mlajor
took him to the boxes, left him there, and went down himself to the pit.
He had not been seated there very long, before he felt an arm thrust
uder his, and a dandy little hand in a kid-glove squeezing his arm.
George had seeu the absurdity of his ways, and coe down from the upper
region. A tender laugh of benevolence lighted up old Dobbin's face and
eyes as he looked ut the repentant little prodigal. le loved the boy, as he
did eerything that belonged to Amelia. How charmed shc was when she
hearl of this intance of George's goodnessl Her eyes looked more kindly
on Dobbin than they ever had done. She blushed, he thought, after
looking at lim so.
Georgy never tired of his praises of the MIaior to his mother. :I like
him, Mamma, because he knows such lots of tlings; and he ain't like old

self ever so much. Grandpapa was quite surprised, and said' Tlat feller l

Emy laugled: she thouglt it was very likely the Major could do
thus much.
If there was a sincere liking between George and the Major, it must be
confessed thnt bctween the boy and his unclc no grent love existed.
George had got a way of blowing out his cheeks, anl putting lis hands in
his waistcont pockets, and saying, `' God bless my soul, youdon't suy so,''
so cxactly ufter the fnhion of old Jos, that it was impossible to restraiu
from laughter. The servnts would cxplode at dinner if the lad, asking
for something which wasn't at table, put on that couutenance and used
thnt favourite phrase. Even obbin woull shoot out a sudden peal at
the boy's mimicry. If George id not mimic his uncle to his face, it
was only by bDobbin's rebukes nnd Amelia's terrified entreaties that the
little scapegrace was induced to resist. And the worthy civilian being
haunted by a dim consciousness that the lad thought him an ass, and wus
inclined to turn him into ridicule, used to be extremely timorous and, of
course, doubly pompous and diguifiel in the presence of Master Georgy.
When it was announeed that the young gentleman was expected in Gillespie

Street to dine with his mother, Mr. Jos commonly found that he hsd
an engagement at the Club. Perhaps nobody was much grieed at his
absence. On those days Mr. Sedley would commonly be induced to come
out from his place of refuge in the upper storeys; and there would be a
small family party, whereof Major Dobbin pretty generally formedone. He
was the ami de la mison; old Sedley's friend, kEmmy's friend, Georgy's
friend, Jos's counsel and adviser. ` He might almost as well be at MIaras
for anything e see of him,'' Miss Ann bDobbin remuarked, at Camberwell.
Ahl Miss Ann, did it not strike you that it was not you whom the MIajor
wanted to marry i
Joseph Sedley then ledl a life of dignified otiosity such as became a
person of his eminenee. His very first point, of course, was to become a
member of the Oriental Club: where he spent his mornings in the com-
pany of his brother Indians, where he dined, or whence he brought lom
men to dine.
Amelia had to reeeive and entertain these gentlemen and their lalies.
From these she heard how soon mith would be in Counceil, how many
laes Jones had brouglt hiome with him  how Thomson's louse in London
had refused the bills drawn by Thomson, Kibobjee and Co., the Bombay
House, and how it was thought the Calcutta House must go too: how
very imprulent, to say the least of it, MIrs. Brown's conduct (wife of
Brown of the Ahmednuggnr Irregulars) had been with young Swankey of
the hBody Guard, sitting up with him on deck until all hours, and losing
themselves as they were riding out at the Cupe: how Mrs. Iardyan
had had out her thirteen sisters, dughters of a country curate, the Re,
Felix Rabbits, and married eleven of thcm, seven high up in the service:
how Hornby was wild because his wife would stay in urope, nd Trotter
was appointed Collector at Ummerapoora. This and siilar tlk took
place, at tho grand dinners all round. They had the same conversation;
the same siler dishes; the sume saldles of mutton, boiled turkeys, and
entrees, Politics set in a short time after dessert, when the ladies retired
up stairs nnl talked about their complaints and tleir children.
ulato nomnine, it is all the same. Don't the barristers' wives talk
about Circuit '-don't the soldiers' ladies gossip about the Iegiment?-
don't the clergymen's ladies discourse about Sunday Sclools, and wha
takes whose duty ?-don't the very greatest lndlies of all talk about that
stnall clique of persons to whom they belong, and why shall our Iulian
friends not have thceir own conversntion -only I adit it is slow for the
layen whose fate it sometimes is to sit by and listen.
Before long Emmy had a visiting-book, und was driving about regulurly
ir a carriage, calling upon Lady Bludyer (wife of Major-(General Sir loger
Bludyer, K.C.B., Bengal Army); Laly Huff, wile of Sir G. Huf, HBombay
litto; Mrs. Pice, the lady of Pice the Director, &c. We are not long in
using ourselves to changes in life. That carriage came round to Gillespie
Street eery day: tlat buttony boy sprang up and dow from the box
with Emmy's and Jos's visiting cards; at stated hours Emmy and the
carriage went for Jos to the Club, and took him an airing; or, putting oll
Sedley into the vehicle, she drove the old man round the Regent's Park.

became soon as familiar to Amelia as the humble routine of Brompton.
She aeeommodated herself to one as to the other. If Fate had ordained
that she should be a duchess, she would even have done that duty too,
She was voted, in Jos's female society, rather a pleasing young person-
not much in her, but pleasing, and tlat sort of thing.

king's officer thnt's alwys hanging about the house-a long, thin, queer-
looking oldish fellow-a dry fellow though, that took the sline out of a
man in the talking line.
Had the MIajor possessed a little more personal vanity he would have
been jcalous of so dungerous a young buck, as that fascinating Bengal
Captain. But Dohbin was of too simple and generous a nature to have
any doubts ubout Anelia. He was glud that the young men should pay
her respect; and that others should admire her. Ever since her woman-
hood almost, had she not been persecuted and underraluelP It pleased
him to see how kindness brought out ler good qualities, and hos her spirits
gently rose ith her prosperity. hAny person who appreciated her paid a
eompliment to the Mjor's good judgment-that is, if a man may be said
to hae good judgent who is under the influence of Love's delusion.
After Jos went to Court, which we may be sure he did as a loyal
subject of his Sovereign (showing himself in hiis full court suit at tle Club,
whither Dobbin came to fetch him in a very shablsy old uniform,) he who
had always becn a staunch Loyalist and admirer of George I., became
such a tremendous Tory andl pillar of the State, that he was for having
Amelia to go to a drawing-room, too. He somehow had worked himsell
up to beliee that he was implicated in the maintenance of the public wel-
fare, nnd that the Sovereign would not be happy unless IJos Sedley and his
family appeared to rally round him at Saint James's.

a passion of grief and frantic tears, such s your end, brother reader, will
never inspire. The denth of an infant which scaroe knew you, which a

want my inheritance-or very poor, and they are tired of supporting

The periol of mourning for Mrs. Selley's death was only just concluded,
and Jos scarcely had had time to cast off his black and appear in the splendid

waistcoats which he loved, when it became evident to those about
Mr. Sedley, that another evtent was at hand, and that te old man was
nabout to go seek for his wife in the dark land whither sle had preceded
him.  Thc state of my father's health,'' Jos Selley solemnly remarked
at the Club, `` prevents me from giving my large parties this season: but
if you will come in quietly at half-past six, Clutney, my boy, anl take a
homely dinner with one or two of the old set-I shall be always glad to
see you''  So Jos and his acquaintances dined an drank their claret
among themselves in silence; whilst the sands of life were running out in
the old man's glass up astairs. The velvet-footed butler brought them
their wine; and they composed themselves to a rubber after dinner: at
which Major Dolbin would sometimes come and take a land: and
Mrs. Osborne would occnsionally descend, when her patient above was
settled for the night, and had commenced one of those lightly troublel
slumbers which visit the pillow of old age.
The oll man clung to his daughter durig this sickness. He would
take his broths and medicines from scarcely any other hand. To tend
him became almost tho sole business of ler life. Her bed was placed
close by te door which opened into his chamber, and she was alive at thc
slightest noise or disturbance from the couch of the querulous invalid.
Tlough, to do him justice, he lay awake many an hour, silent and without
stirring, unwilling to awasken his kind and vigilant nurse.
IIc loved his daughter with more fondness no, perhaps, than ever he
hal done since tho days of her childhood. In the discharge of gentle
offices and kind filial duties, this simple creature shone mot espeeially.
 Shc wulks into the room as silently as a sunbeam,'' Mr. Dobbin
thought, as he saw her passing in and out from her father's room: a
cheerful sweetness lighting up her face as she moved to and fro, graceful
and noiseless. When women are brooding over their children, or busied
in a sick room, who has not seen in their faces those sweet angelic beams
of love and pityf
A secret feud of some years standing was thus healel: and with a taceit
reconciliation. In these lnst hours and touched by her love and goodness,
the old man iorgot all his grief against her, and wrongs which he and his
wife had many a long night debated: how she had given up everytling
for her boy: how she was careless of her parents in their old age and
misfortune, and only thought of the child: how absurlly and foolislly,
impiously indeed, she took on, when George was removed from her. Old
Bedley forgot these charges as he was making up his last account, and did
justice to the gentle and uncomplaining little martyr. One night when
she stole into his room, she found lim awake, when the broken old man
made his confession. O, Emmy, I've been tlinking we were very
unkind and unjust to you,'' he said, and put out his cold and feeble hand
to her. She knelt down and prayed by his bedsile, as he did too, huving
still hold of her hanl. When our turn comes, friend, may we have such
company in our prayers.
Perhaps as he was lying awake then, his life may hae passed before
lim-his early hopeful struggles, his manly successes and prosperity, his
downfal in his declining years, and his present helpless condition-no

To have, and to be forced to yield,; or to sink out of life, having plsyed

life comes and we say, `` To-orrov, success or failure won't matter much:
and the sun will rise, and all tle myriads of mankind go to their work o
their pleasure as usual, but I shall be out of the turmoil''
So there came one morning and sunrise, wlen all the world got up and
net about its various works and pleasuree, with the exeeption of Old Joseph
Sedley, who was not to fight with fortune, or to hope or scheme any more:
but to go and take up a quict and utterly unknown residence in a churche
yarl at Brompton by tle side of his old wife.
Major Dobbin, Jos, and Georgy followed his remains to the grave, ina
hlack cloth coach. Jos came on purpose from the Star and Garter at
Richmond, whither he retrcated after the deplorable eent. He did not
care to remain in the house, with the-under the circumstanees, yon un-
derstand. But lLmmy staid and did her duty as usual. She was bowed
down by no especial grief, and rather solemn than sorrowful. She prayed
that hcr own end might be as calm and painless, and thought with trust

and reverence of the worls which shc had heard from her father during his
illness, indicative of his faith, his resignation, and his future hope.
Yes, I think thnt will be the better ending of the two, after all. Suppose
you are particularly rich and well to do, and sny on that last day,''I am
very rich; I am tolerably well known; I have lived all my life in the best
society, and, thank Hencn, come of a most respectable family. I havc
sered my King and couutry with honour. I was in Parliamnent for several
years, where, I may say, my speeches were listened to, and pretty well re-
ceived. I don't owe any man a shilling: on the contrary, I lent my old
college friend, Jaek Lazarus, ffty pounds, for which my exeeutors will not
press him. Ileave my duughters with ten thousand pounds a-piece-very
good portions for girls: I bequeath my plate and furniture, my house in
Baker Street, with a handsome jointure, to my wilow for her life; and my
landed property, besides money in the funds, and my cellar of well-selected
wine iu Baker Street, to my son. I leave twenty pound a-year to my valet;
and I defy any man after I am gone to find anything against my charaeter.''
Or suppose, on the other hand, your swan sings quite a different sort of
dirge, and you asay, '`I am a poor, blighted, disappointed old fvellow, and
have made an utter failure through life. I wns not endowed either with
brins or with good fortune: and confess that I have committed a hundred
mistakes and blunders. I own to having forgotten my duty many a time.
I can't pay what I owe. On my last bed I lie utterly helpless and
humble; and I pry forgieness for my weakness, and throw myself with
a contrite heart, at the feet of the Divine Mercy.'' Which of these twa
speeches, think you, would be the best oration for your own funeral old
Sedley made the last; and in that humble frame of mind, and holding by
the hand of his daughter, life and disappointment and anity sank aey
from under him.
e You see,'' said old Osborne to George, '`what comes of merit and
industry, and judicious speculations, and that. Look at me and my banker's
aceount. Look at your peor grandfather, Sedley, and his failure. And yet
he was a better man than l was, this day twenty years-a better man I
should say, by ten thousand pound.''
Beyond these people and Mr. Clapp's family, who came over from
Brompton to pasy a visit of condolenee, not a single soul alive ever careda
penny piece about old John Sedley, or remembered the existence of such
a person.
When old Osborne first heard from his friend Colonel Buckler (s little
Georgy has already informed us) how distinguished an officer Major
Dobbin was, he exhibited a great deal of scornful incredulity, and expressed
his surprise how eer sueh a feller as that should possess either brains or
reputation. But he heard of the Major's fame from various members of
his soeiety. Sir William Dobbin had a great opinion of his son, and
narrated many stories illustrative of the Major's learning, valour, and
estimntion in the world's opinion. Finally, his name appeared in the lists
of one or two great parties of the nobility; and this circumstance had a

been ccled to his grandfather, rendered some meetings between the two
geutlemen inevitable; and it was in one of thesc that old Osborne, a keen
nan of business, looking into the MIsjor's accounts with his ward and thc
boy's mother, got a hint which ataggered him very much, and at once
pained anl plcased him, that it was out of William Dobbin's own pocket
that a part of the fund had been supplied upon which the poor widow and
the child had subsisted.
When pressed upon the point, Dobbin, who eould not tell lies, blushed
and stammered a good deal, and finally confessed. ` The marriage,'' he
said, (at which his interlocutor's face grew dark,) '`was very much my
loing. I thought my poor frienl had gone ao far, that retreat from his
engagement woull have been dishouour to him, and death to Mrs.
Osborue; and I could do no less, when she was left without resources,
than give what money I could spare to maintain her,''
Mnjor D.,'' Mr. Osborne said, lookiug hard at him, and turning very
red too-`' You did me a grcat injury; but give me leave to tell you, Sir,
you are an honest fcller. There's my hand, Sir, though I little thought
that my flesh and blool was a living on you-'' and the pair shook hands,
with great confusion on Major Dobbin's part, thus foundl out in his act of
charitable hypocrisy.
lIe strove to soften the old man, nd reconcile him towards his sons
memory. ``IIe was such a noble fcllow,'' he said, '` that all of us loed
him, and would have done anything for him. 1I, as a young man in those
days, was flattered beyond measure by his prelerence for mo; and was
more pleased to be seen in his company thn in that of the Commander-in-
Chief. I never saw his equal for pluck and daring, and all the qualities of
a soldier;'' and Dobbin told the old father as many stories as he could
remember regarding thc gallantry and achievements of his son. ``And
Georgy is so like him,'' the MIajor addel.
 IIe 's so like him tht e makes me tremble sometimes,'' the gran-
father said.
On one or two evenings the Major came to dine with Mr, Osborne, (it
was during the time of the sickness of MIr. Sedley), and as the two sate
together in the evening aflter dinner all their talk was about the departed
hero. The father bousted about him according to hia wont, glkorifying
himself in recounting his son's feats anl gallantry, but his mood was at
any rute better and more charitable than that in which he had been
disposed until now to regard the poor fello; and the Christian heart of
the kind Msjor was pleased at these symptoms of returning peaee and
good will. On tho second eening old Oslorne called Dobbin, WVilliam,
just as he used to do at the time wheu Dolbin nnd Georyge were boys
together: and thc honest gentleman was pleased by that mark of
reconciliation.
On the next dny at brcakfast when Mliss Osborne, with the asperity of
her agc and charactcr, ventured to make some remark retlecting slightingl
npon the Major's appearance or behaviour-the master of the hous
interrupted her. `' You'd hae been glnd enouh to git him for yourself

 Tlnt he is, Grandpaps,'' ssid Georgy, approvringly: and going p
close to the old gentleman he took a hold of his large grey wliskers, and
laughedl in his face good-humouredly and kissed him. nd he told the
story at night to his mother: who fully agreed with the boy.`` Indeed
he is,'' she sid.  our dear father always sasid so. He is one of the
best and most upright of men.'' Dobbin happened to drop in very soon
after this conersation, which made Amelia blush perhaps; and the young
scapegrace incereased the confusion by telling Dobbin the other part of the
story. `'I say Dob,'' he said, `` there's such an uueommon nice girl
wants to marry you. She's plenty of tin : she wears a front : and she scolds
the servnnts from morning till night.,'' e Who is it2'' usked Dobbin.
It 's aunt O,'' the boy answered, ``Grandpapa said so. And I say,
Dob, how primo it would be to have you for my nncle.'' Old Sedley's
quavering voice from the next room at this moment weakly called for
Amelia and the laughing ended.
That old Osborne's mind was changing was pretty clear. He askel
George about his unele sometimes, and laughed at the boy's imitation of
the way in which Jos suid '' God-bless-my-soul'' and gobbled his soup.
Then he said, ` It's not respectful, Sir, of you younkers to be imitating
of your relations. Miss O, when you go out a-driving to-day, leave my
card upon Mr. Sedley, do you hear. here's no quarrel betwigst me and
him anyhow.''
The cnrd wns eturued, and Jos and the Major were asked to dinner,
--to a dinner the most splendid and stupid that perhaps ever Mr. Osborne
guve; every inch of the family plate was exhibited, and the best company
was asked. Mr. Sedley took down Miss O. to dinner, and she wus very
gracious to im; whereas she hardly spoke to the Major, who sate apart
lrom her, and by the side of Mr. Osborne, very timid. Jos said, with
great solemnity, it was the best clear turtle soup he had ever tasted in
his life ; and asked Mr. Osborne where he got his Madeira?
 It is some of Sedley's wine,'' whispered the butler to his master.
 I're hnd it a long time, and paid a good figure for it, too,'' Mr. Osborne
said aloud to lis guest; and then whispered to his right-hand neighour
how le had got it `` at the olt chap's snle.''
More than onee he aske the Major abhout-about Mrs. George Osborne
-a theme on which the Mnjor coukd be very eloquent whcn he chose.
IIe told Mr. Osborne of her sufferings-of her passionate attachment to
her husband, whose meotry she worshipped still,-of the tender and
dutiful manner in which she had supported her parents, snd given up ler
boy, when it seemel to her her duty to do so. : You don't know wat
she endurol, Sir,'' snid honest Dobbin, with a tremor in his voice; `` and
I hope and trust you will be reconciled to her. If she took your son
away from you, she gave hers to you; and however much you loved your
Gcorge, depend on it, she loved hers ten times more.''
 By God, you are a good feller, Sir,'' was all Mr. Osborne snid. It
hnd never struck him that the widow would feel any pin at parting with
the boy, or thut his having a fiue fortnne could grieve her. A reconcilia-
tion was announced as speedy nand inevitable; and Amelia's heart ulrendy
began to bent at the notion of the awful meeting with George's father.

It was ever, however, destined to take place. Old Sedley's lingering
illuess and death supervrened, after which a meeting was for some time
impossible. hat cutastrophe and other events may have worked upon
Mr, Osborne. le was much shaken of late, and aged, and his mind was
working inwardly. He had sent for his lawyers, and probably changed
something in his will. The medical man who looked in, pronouced him
shaky, agitated, and talked of a little blood, and the sea-side; but he took
neither of these remedies.
One day when he should hae come down to breakfast, his serant
missing him, went into his dressing-room, and found him lying at the
foot of the dressing-table in a fit. Mias Osborne was apprised; the
doctors were sent for : Georgy stopped away from school: the bleeders
and cuppers came. Osborne partially reguined cognizance ; but never could
speak again,though he tried dreadfully onee or twice, and in four days he died.
The doctors went down; the undertaker's men went up the stairs; nnd all
the shutters were shut towards the garden in Russell quare. Bullock
rushel from the city in a hurry. : How much money had he left to that
boy -not half, surely Surely share and share ulike between the three?''
It was an agiiating moment.
What was it that poor old man had tried once or twice in vain to say
I hope it was that he wanted to see Amelia, and be reconciled before he
left the world to the dear and faithful wife of his son : it was most likely
that ; for his will showed that the hatred which he hasd so long cherished
had gone out of his heart,
They found in the pocket of his dressing-gown the letter with the great
red seal, which George had written him from Waterloo. He had looked
at the other papers too, relative to his son, for the key of the box in
which he kept them was also in his poeket, and it was found the seals and
envelopes had been broken-very likely on the night before the seizure-
when the butler had taken him tea into his study, and found him reading in
the great red family bible.
When the will was opened, it was found that half the property was left
to George, anl the remainder between the two sisters. Mr. Bulloek to
continue, for their joint benefit, the affairs of the eommercial house, or to
go out, as he thought fit. hn annuity of five hundred pounds, chargeable
on George's property, was left to his mother, the widow of my beloved
son George Osborne,' who was to resume the guardianship of the boy.
Msior William Dobbin, my belovrel son's friend,' was appointed exe-
cutor; ` and as out of his kindness and bounty, and with his own priate
funds, he maintained my grandson, and my son's widow, when they were
otherwise without means of support,' (the testator went on to say)'I
hereby thank him heartily, for his love and regard for them; and beseech
him to accept such a sum as may be sufficient to purchase his commission as
a Lieutenant-Colonel, or to be disposed of in any way he may think fit,'
When Amelia heard that her father-in-law was reconciled to her, her
heart melted, and she was grateful for the fortune left to her. But when
she heard how Georgy was restored to her, and knew how and by whom,
and how it was William's bounty that supported her in poverty, how it
was William who gave her her husband and her son-O, then she sank on

her knees, and prayed for blessings on that constant and kinl heart: she
bowed down und humbled herself, and kissed the feet, as it were, of that
beautiful and generous nffection.
And gratitude was all that she had to pay back for such admirable de-
votion and benefits-only gratitudel If she thought of any other return,
the image of George stood up out of the grare, and said, ` You are mine,
and mine only, now and for ever,''
Williasm knew her feelings: had he not passed his whole life in divining
them'
WThen the nature of Mr. Osborne's will beeame known to the world, it
was edifying to remark how Mrs. George Osborne rose in the estimation
of the people forming her circle of acquaintance. The servants of Jos's
establishment, who used to question her humble orders, and say they would
`` ask aster,'' whether or not they could obey, neer thought now of thut
sort of appeal. The eook forgot to sneer at her shabby old gowns (which,
indeed, were quite eclipsed by that lady's finery when she was dressed to
go to church of a unday evening), the others no longer grumbled at the
sound of her bell, or delayed to answer that summons. The coachman,
wlo grumbled that his osses should be brought out, and his carriage made
into an ospital for thnt old feller and Mrs., O., drove her with the utmost
alacrity now, and trembling lest he should be superseded by Mr. Osborne's
coachman, asked '` what them there Russell Square coachmen knew about
tow, and whether tey was fit to sit on a box before a lady'' Jos's
friends, male and female, suddenly became interested about Lmmy, and
cards of condolenee multiplied on her hall table. Jos himself, who had
looked on her as a goodnatured harmless pnuper, to whom it was his duty
to give victuals and shelter, paid her and the rich little boy, his nephew,
the greatest respect-was anxious that she should have change and amuse-
ment after her troubles and trials, '`poor dear girl''-and began to appear
at the breakfast-table, and most partieularly to ask how she would like to
dispose of the day.
In her capacity of guardian to Georgy, she, with the consent of the
Major, her fellow-trustee, begged Miss Oslorne to live in the Russell
Square house as long as ever she chose to dwell there; but that lndy, with
thanks, declarel that she never could think of remaiuing alone in that
melancholy mansion, and departed in deep mourning, to Cheltenham, with
a couple of her old domestics. Therest were liberally paid and dismissed;
the faithful oll butler, whom Mrs. Oborne proposed to retain, resigning
and preferring to invest his savings in a public-house, where, let us hope,
he was not unprosperous. Miss Osborne not choosing to live in Russell
Bquare, Mrs. Osborne also, after consultation, declined to oecupy the
gloomy old mansion there. The house was dismantled; the rich furniture
and effects, the awful chandeliers and dreary blank mirrors packed away
and hidden, the rich rosewood drawing-room suite was muffled in straw,
the carpets were rolled up and corded, the small seleect library of well-
bound books was stowed into two wine chests, and the whole parphernalia
rolled away in several enormous vans to the Pantechnicon, where they were
to lie until Georgy's msjority. And the great heavy dark plate-chests

went off to Messrs. Stupy und Rowly, to lie in the cellars of those
eminent bankers until the same period should arrive.
One day lmmy with Gcorge in her hand and clad in deep sables went
to visit the deserted mansion which she had not entered sinee she was a
girl. The plaee in front was littered with straw where the vans had been
laden and rolled off. They went into the great blank rooms, the walls of
which bore the marks where the pictures and mirrors had hung. Then
they went up the great blank stone-ataircases into the upper rooms, into
that where grandpapa died, as George said in a whisper, and then higher
still into George's own room. The boy was still clinging by her side, but
she thought of another besides him. She knew that it had been his
father's room as well as his own.
She went up to one of the open windowe (one of those nt which she
used to gaze with a siok heart when the ehild wns first taken from her)
nnd thenee ns she looked out she could eee over the trees of Russel Square,
the old house in which she herself was born, and where shc had passed so
many hnppy das of sacred youth. They all came baek to her, the pleasant
holidays, the kind faces, the careless, joyful past times; and the long
pains and trials that had since cast her down. She thouglt of these
nnd of the man who had been her eonstant protector, her good genius, her
sole benefactor, her tender and generous friend.
`Look here, mother,'' said Georgy, `` here's a G. O. seratehed on the
glass with a diamond; I never saw it before, I never did it.''
tIt was your father's room long long before you were bomn, George,''
she said, and she blushed as she kissed the boy.
She was very silent as they drove back to Richmond where they had
taken a temporary house: where thesmiling lawyers used to come bustling
over to see her: (unl we may be sure noted the visit in the bill) and
where of course there wns a room for Masjor Dobbin too, who rode over
frequently, huving much business to transaet in behalf of his little wnrt.
Georgy at this time was removed from Mr, Veal's on an unlimited
holidny, and that cntlcman was engaged to prepare an inseription fora
fine marble slab, to be placed up in the oundling under the monument of
Cnptain George Osborue.
The female Bullock, aunt of Georgy, although despoiled by that little
monster of one-half of the sum which shc expected from her father, never-
theless showed her charitableness of spirit by being reeonciled to the
mother and the boy. Roehampton is not far from Riclmond, nd one
lny the chariot, with the golden Bullocks emblazoned on the panels,
nnd the flaceeid ehildren within, drove to Amelia's house at Riclhmond;
nnd the Bullock family made an irruption into the garden, where Amelia
was readingg n book, Jos was in an arbour placidly dipping strawberries
into wine, and the MIajor in one of his Indian jackets was giving a baek to

glanced towards that dear child, an unwholesome little Miss of seven
years of age.
` Rosa, go and kiss your dcar cousin,'' Mrs. Frederiek said.  Don't
you know me, George f-I am your aunt,''
IT know you well enough,'' George said; ` but I don't like kissing,
please;'' and he retreated from the obedient caresses of his ocousin.
 Take me to your dear mamma, you droll ochild,'' Mrs. Fraderick said;
and those ladies aocordingly met, after an absenee of more than fifteen
years. During Emmy's cares and poverty the other had never once
thought about coming to see her; but now that she was deeently proeperous
in the world, her sister-in-law came to her as a matter of course.
So did numbers more. Our old frienl, Miss Schwartz, and her hus-
band came thundering over from Hampton Court, with flaming yellow
liveries, and was as impetuously fond of Amelia as ever. Schwartz
would have liked her always if she could hae seen her. One must do
her that justice. But, ue ooulez sos '-in this vast town one has not
the time to go and seek one's friends; if they drop out of the rank
they disappcnr, and we march on without them. Who is ever missed in
Vanity Fair:
But so, in a word, and before the period of grief for Mr. Osborne's
death had subsided, Emmy founl herself in the centre of a very genteel
circle indeed; the members of which could not conceive that nnybody
belonging to it was not very lucky. Thcre was scarce oue of the ladies
that han't a relation a eer, though the husband might bc a lrysalter in
the City. Some of the ladies were very blue and well informel; reading
Mrs. Somerville, and frequentiug the Royal Institution; others were
severe and Evangelical, and held by Exeter Hall. Emmy, it must be
owned, found herself entirely at a loss in tle midst of tleir clavers, and
suflered wofully on the one or two occasions in which she was compelled
to accept Mrs. Frederick Bullock's hospitalities. That luly persisted in
patronising her, and determinel most graciously to form her. She found
Amelia's milliners for her, and regulated her houschold and her manners.
She drove over constantly from Roehampton, and entertained her friend
with faint fashionable fiddlefadlle and feeble Court slipslop. Jos liked to
hear it, but the Major used to go off growling at the appearance of this
woman, with her twopenny gentility. He went to sleep under Frederick
Bullock's bald heal, after dinner, at one of the banker's best parties, (Fred
was still anxious that the bnlance of the Osborne property should be
trausferrel from Stumpy and lowy's to tlem), and whilst Amclia, who
did not know Lntin, or who wrote the last craek anrticle in the Edinburgh,
nnd dil not in the lcast deplore, or otherwise, Mr, Peel's late extraordi-
nary tergivsersation in the fatal Cutholic Relief Bill, sate dumb amongst the
ladies in the grand drawing-room, looking out upon velvet lawns, trin
gravel walks, and glistening hot-houses.
She seems goodnatured but insiid,'' said Mrs. Rowdy; `` that Major
seems to be particularly epris.''
She wants to sadly,'' said Mrs. IIollyoeck. ` MIy tear creature, you

`and as such lI think we're all bound to gie her every attention and in-

eThat poor dear Mrs. Bulloeck,'' ssid Rowdy to Hollyock, as they drove

Rosa, is perfectly ridiculous.''

But this sort of society was too cruelly genteel for Emmy: and all
jumped for joy when a foreign tour was proposed.

had occurred, and a few
weeks had passed, when,
on one fine morning,
Parliament being over, the
summer advanced, and
all the good company in
London about to quit that
city for their annual tour
in search of pleasure or
health, the Batavier steam-
boat left the Tower-stairs
laden with a goolly com-
pany of English fugitives.
The quarter-deck awn-
ings were up, and the
benches and gangways
crowded with scores of
rosy children, bustling
nursemaids, ladies in the
prettiest pink bonnets and snmmer dresses, gentlemen in travelling
caps and linen jackets, whose mustachios had just begn to sprout
tor the ensuing tour; and stout trim old vcterans with starched
neckclotls and neat-brushed hats, such ns hae invaded Europe
ny time since the conclusion of the war, and cnrry the nntional
Goddem into every city of the Continent. The congregation of hat-
boxes, and Bramah desks, aud dressing-cases was prodigious. There
were jaunty young Camlridge-men travelling with their tutor, and going
for a reading exeursion to Nonnenwerth or Kinigswinter: there were
Irish gentlemen, with the most dashing whiskers and jewellery, talking
about horses ineessantly, and prodigiously polite to the young ladies on
board, whom, on the contrary, the Cambridge lads and tleir pale-facel
tutor avoided with maiden coyness: there were old Pall Mall loungers
bound for Ems and Wiesbaden, and a course of waters to clear off the
dinners of the season, and a little roulette and trente-et-uarante to keep
the excitement going: there was old Methuselah, who had married his

young wife, with Captain Papillon of the Guards holding her parasol and
guide-books: there was young Mlay who was carrying off his bride ona
pleasure tour, (Mrs. WViuter that was, and who had been at school with May's
grandmother ;) there was Sir John and my Lady with a dozen children,
and corresponding ursemaids; nnd the great grandee Bareacres family
that sate by themselves near the wleel, stared at everybody, and spoke to
no one. Their carriages, emblazoned with coronets, and heaped with
shining imperials, were on the foredeck; locked in with a dozen more such
veicles : it was difficult to puss in and out amongst them: and the poor
inmates of the fore-cabiu had scarcely nny space for locomotion. These
consisted of a few magnificently attired gentlemen from IHIoundsditch, who
brought their own provisions, and could have bought half the gay people
in the grand saloon; a few honest fellows with mustachios and portfolios,
who set to sketching before they had been half-an-hour on board; one or
two French femmes de eamre who began to be dreadfully ill by the
time the bont had passed Greenwich; a groom or two who lounged in
the neighbourhood of the horse-boxes under their charge, or leaned
over the side by the paddle-wheels, and talked about who was good for
the Leger, and what they stood to win or lose for the Goodwood
cup.
All the couriers, when they haf done plunging about the ship, and had
settled their various masters in the cabins or on the deek, congregated
together and hegan to clatter and smoke; the Hebrew gentlemen joining
them and looking at the carriages. There was Sir Joh's great carriage
that would hold thirteen people; my Lord Methuselah's crriasge, my Lord
Breacre's chariot, britskn, and fourgon, that anybody might pay for who
liked. It was a wonder how my Lord got the resdy money to pay for
the expenses of the journey. The Hebrew gentlemen knew how le got it.
They knew what money his Lordship had in his pocket at that instant,
and what iuterest he paid for it, and who gave it him. Finally there was
a very neat, hanlsome travelling carriage, about whieh the gentlemen
speculated.

Kirsch emerging presently from the neighbourhood of the hold where
he had been bellowing instruetions intermingled with polyglot oaths to
the ship's men engaged in aseercting the passengers' luggage, came to
give an account of himself to his brother interpreters. He informed them
that the cuarriage belonged to a Nahab from Caleutta and Jamaic,
enormously rich, and with whom he was engaged to travel; and nt this
moment a young gentleman who had been warned off the bridge between
the paddle-boxes, and who had dropped thenee on to the roof of Lord
Methuselah's carrinage, from which he had made his way over other
carriages and imperials until he had clambered on to his own, desoended
thence and through the window into the body of the csrriage to the
applause of the couriers looking on.

nearly opposite to the Earl of Bureacres and his family, whose proceedings
absorbed the Bengalee almost entirely. Both the noble couple looked
ratler younger than in the eventfiul year '15, when Jos remembered to
have seen them at Brussels (indeed he always gave out in Irdia that he
was intimately aequainted with them). Ldy Carabas's hair which was
then dark was now a beautiful golden auburn, whereas Lord Carabss's
wliskers, formerly red, were at present of a rich blaek with purple and
green refleetions in the light. But changed ass they were, the moements
of the noble psir oceupied Jos's mind entirely. The presence of a lord
fuascinated him, and he could look at nothing else.
Those people seem to interest you a good deal,'' ssid Dobbin,
laughing and watchiug him. Amelia too laughed. She was in a stra
bonnet with black riblons, und otherwise dressel in mourning: hut the
little bustle and holiday of the journey pleased and excited her, and she
looked particularly happy.
 What a heavenly duy,'' Emmy said, and alded, with great origiuality,
ee I hope we shall have a calm passage.''
Jos wavel his hand, scornfudly glancing at the same time under his
eyelids ant the greast folks opposite.  If you had made the voyages ve

ncverthcless, traveller as he was, he pssed thc night direfully sick in his
criag, where his couricr tended him with brandy-and-water and every
luxury.
In due time this happy party landed at the quays of Rotterdam, whence
they were transported hy nnother stenmer to the city of Cologne. Here
the carriage and the family took to the shore, and Jos was not a littl
gratilied to sce lis arrial announced in the Cologne newspapers as IIerr
Graf Larl von Sedlcy nehsst Begleitung aus London.' Hc had his court
iress wiIh him : he had insisted tlt Dobbin shonull bring his regiental

As for Emmy, she was very happy and pleased. Dobbin used to carry
about for ler her stool and sketch-book, and admired the drawings of the
goodnatured little artist, as they never had been admired efore. She
sate upon stenmer's decks and drew crags and castles, or she mounted
upon donkeye and ascended to ancient robber-towers, attended by her two
ides-de-camp, Georgy and Dobbin. Bhe laughed, and the Major did too,

and by assiduously conversing with Herr Kirsch on the box of the cur-
riage., eorgy made proigious adsnee in the knowledge of High Dutch,
and could talk to hotel waiters and postillions in a way that charmel his
mother, and amused his guardian.
Mr. Jos did not much enguge in the afternoon excursions of his fellow-
travellers. HIe slept n good deal nfter dinuer, or bnsked in the arbours of
the pleasnnt inn-gardens. Pleasant Rhine gurdensl Iair sceues of peace

of those scenes of friendly repose and beauty2 To lay down the pen, and
even to think of tht beautiful Rhineland makes one happy. At this time
of sumer cvening, the cows are trooping down from the hills, lowing and
with their bells tinkling, to the old town, with its old moats, and gates,
and spires, and chestnut-trees, with long blue shados stretching oer the
grass; the sky and the river below flame in crimson and gold; and the
moon is already out, looking pale towards the sunset. The sun siuks
ehind the great castle-crested mouutains, the night falls suddenly, the
river grows darker and darker, lights quiver in it from the windows in
the old ramparts, and twinkle peacefully in the villages under the lills on

duced Ior the first time to the wonders of Mozurt and Cimarosa. Tle
Mnjor's musical taste has been before alluded to, and his performanees on
the flute commendel. But perhaps the chief pleasure he had in these
opcras was in watching Emmy's rapture while listening to them. A new
world of love and beauty broke upon her when she was introduced to those

how could she be indifferent when sle heard Mozart The teuder parts

Mrs, Osborne had been furnished during her life at Bromptou) he told her
nn Eastern fable of the Owl who thought that the snnshine was unberable
for the eyes, anl that the Nightingnale was a most overrated bird. ` It is
one's nature to sing and the otler's to hoot,'' he said, laughing, `` and with
such a sweet voice as you have yourself, you must belong to the Bulbul
faction.''
I like to dwell upon this period of her life, and to think that she was
cheerful and happy. YIou see she has not hd too much of that sort of
existence as yet, and has not fallen in the way of means to educate her
tastes or her intelligence. She has been domineered over hitherto h
vulgar intellects. It is the lot of many a woman. hnd as every one of
the dear sex is the rival of the rest of her kind, timidity passes for folly
in their charitable judgments; and gentleness for dulness; and silence-
which is but timid denial of the unwelcome assertion of ruling folks,
nnd tacit protestantism-nbove all, finds no mercey at the hands of the
femnle Inquisition. Thus, my dear and civilised reader, if you and I were
to fiud ourselves this evening in a socicty of greengrocers, let us say; it is
probable that our conversation would not be brilliant; if, on the other
hand, a greengrocer shoull find himself at your refined and polite tea-
table, where everybody was saying witty things, and everybody of faslion
and repute tearing her friends to pieces in the most lelightful manncr, it
is possible that the stranger would not bc very talkativc, and by no means
interesting or interested.
Mnd it must be reembercd, that this poor lady had never met a gentle-
man in her life until this present moment. Perhnps thcse are rarer per-
sonages than some of us think for. Which of us can point out many such
in his circle-men whose ais are generous, whose truth is constant, and
not only constant in its kind but elevated in its degree; whose want of
meanness makes them simple: who can look the world honestly in the
face with an equnl manly sympathy for the great and the small? We all
know na hundred whose coats are very well made, and a score who have
excellent . manners, and one or two happy beings who are what they call,
in the inner circles, and hve shot into the very centre and bull's eye of the
fashion; but of gentlemen how many? Let us take a little serap of paper
and each make out his list.
My friend the Mnjor I write, without any doubt, in mine. He had
very long legs, n yellow face, and a slight lisp, which at first ws rather
ridiculous. lBut his thoughts were just, his brains were fairly good, his
life was honest and pure, and his heart warm and humble. lIe certainly
had very large hands and feet, which the two George Osbornes used to
cnricature and laugh at; and their jeers and laughter perhaps led poor
little Emmy astray as to his worth. But hae we not all been misled
nbout our heroes, and changd our opinions a hundred times Emmy,
in this happy timc, found that hers underwent a very great change in
respeet of the merits of the MIajor.

Perhaps it was the happiest time of botl tleir lives indeed, if they did
but know it-nnd who doesP WYhich of us cnn point out and say that was
the culmination-that was the summit of human joy? But at all events,
this couple were very decently contented and enjoyed as pleasant a summet
tour as any pair that left England that year. Georgy was always present
at the play, but it was the Mnjor who put Emmy's shawl on after the
entertainment; and in the walks ad excursious the young lad would be
on a head, and up a tower-stair or a tree, whilst the soberer couple were
below, the Najor smoking his cigar with great placidity and constancy,
whilst Emmy sketched the site or the ruin. It was on this very toun
thnt I, the present writer of n history of which every word is true, had thoe
pleasure to see them first, and to make their aequaintance.
It was at the little comfortable Granl Ducal town of Pumperickel (that
very place wlere Sir Pitt Crawlcy lnd been so distinguished as an attaele';
but that was in early early nys, nnd before the news of the battle of
Austerlitz sent all the Euglish diplomatists in Germany to the right ahout)
that I firat saw Colonel Dobbin and his party. Thcy had arrivel with the
carriage and courier at the Erbprinz lotel, the best of the town, and the
wlele party dined at the talle llite. Everybody remarked the majesty
of Ios, and the knowing way in which he sipped, or rtler sucked, the
Johannisberger, which he orlered for dinner. The little boy, too, we
observed, had a famous nppetite, and consumed schinken, and braten, nnd
kartotleln, and cranlerry jam, and snlad, and pudding, and roast fowls,
nnd swectneats, with a gnllantry that did honour to his nation. After
about fiftcen dishes, he concluded the repast with dessert, some of which
he een carried out of doors; for some young gentlemen at table, amused
with his coolness and gallant free and casy manner, induced him to pocket
n handful of macnroone, which he discussed on his way to the thentre,
whithcr everybody went in the cheery social little German place. The
laly in black, the oy's mamma, laughed and blushel, and loked exceed-
ingly pleased and shy as thc dinner went on, nnd at the various feats aund
instances of espilerie on the part of her son. The Colonel-for so he
became very soon afterwnrds-I remember joked the boy with a great
deal of grave fun, poiutiug out dishes wlich he lad't tried, and entreat-
ing him not to baulk his appetite, bUut to lave a second supply of this or
that.
It was what they call a gat-rolle night nt tle loyul Grand Ducal
Tumperuickclisch Hof,-or Court theatre; and Madme Sclroeder bDevricnt,
then in the bloom of her beauty nl genius, performel the part of the
heroine in the wonderful opera of Fidelio. From our places in the stalls
we could see our fonr friends of the talle d'Idte, in the loge which
Schwendler of the Erbprinz kept for lis bUest guests : and I conld not
help remarking the effeet which the magnificent nctress and music pro-
duced upon Mrs., Osborne, for so wo had heard the stout gentlemn in the
mustachios call her. During the astonishiug Chorus of the Prisoners over
wieh thc delightful voice of the actrcss rose and soared in the most
raviehirg harmony, her iace wore sueh an cxpression of wonder and de-
liglt that it struck even little Fipps, the lase attach, who draled

out, as he fixed his glass upon her, `Gayd, it really does one good to see
n woman caypable of that stayt of excaytement.'' Anl in the Prison
Scene where Fidelio, rushiug to her husband, cries :' Nichts nichts mein
Florestan,'' she fairly lost herself and covered her face with her handkerchief.
Every woman in the house was snivelling at the time: but Il suppose it was
because it was predestined that I was to write this particular lady's
memoirs that I remarked her.
The next day they ge another piece of Beethoven. ''Die Schlucht bei
Vittoria.'' Malbrook is introduced at the beginning of the performance, as
indicative of the brisk advance of the French Army. Then coe drums,
trumpets, thunder of artillery, and groans of the dying, and at last in a
grand triumphant swell, `' God save the king '' is performed.
There may have been a score of Lnglishme in the house, but at the
burst of that beloved and well-known music, everyone of them, we young
fellows in the stalls, Sir John and Lady Bullninster (who hal taken a
house at Pumpernickel for the education of their nine children), the
fat getleman with the mustachios, the long Major in wlite duck trowsers,
nnd the lady with the little boy upon who he was so sweet; cen
Kirsch, the courier in the gullery, stool bolt upright in their places, and
proclaimed tlemseles to be members of the denr old British nation. As
for Tapeworm, the Secretary of Legtion, he rose up in his box and
bowed and simpered, as if he would represent the whole empire. Tape-
wormn was nephew nnd heir of old Marshl Tiptoff, who has been
introduced in this story as General Tiptoff, just before Waterloo, who was
Colonel of the -th regiment in which Mnjor Dobbin served, and who
died in this year full of honours, and of an aspic of ploer's eggs; when
the regiment was graciously given by his Majesty to Colonel Sir Michael
O'Dowd, K.C.B., who had commanded it in many glorious fields.
Tapeworm must hae met with Colonel Dobbin at the house of the
Colonel's Colonel, the Marshl, for he recognisel him on this night at the
theatre; and with the utmost condescension, his Majesty's minister came
over from his own box, and publicly shook hnnds with his new-found
friend.
``Look at tht infernal sly boots of n Tapeworm,'' Fipps whispered,
exaining his Chief from the atalls.  Wherever there's a pretty woman
he always twists himself in.'' And I wonler what were diplomatists made
for but for that ?
Have I the honour of addressing myself to Mrs. Dobbin,'' asked
the Seeretary, with a most insinuating grin.
Georgy burst out laughing, and said `` By Jove, that is a good 'un.''-
Emmy and the Major blushed: we saw thcm from the stalls.
 This lady is Mrs. George Osborne,'' ssid the Major, '` and this is her
brother, Mr. Selley, a distinguished otfficer of the Bengal Ciril Service:
permit me to introduce him to your lordship.''
MIy lord nearly sent Jos off his legs, with the most fascinating smile.
`'Are you going to stop in Pumpernickel,'' he said.  It is s dull place:
but we want some nice people, and we would try and make it sa
agreeable to you. Mr.-Ahum-Mrs.-Oho. I slall do myself the
honour of calling upon you to-morrow at your inn.''-And he went away

Tle performance over, tle young fellows lounged about the lobbies, and
we saw the society take its departure. The Duehess Dowager went of
in her jingling old conch, attended by two faithful and withered old maids
of honour, and a little snufy spindle-shanked gentleman in waiting, in a
brown jasey and a green coat covered with orders-of which the star and
the grand yellow eordon of the order of 9uint Michael of Pumpernickel
was most conspicuous. The drums rolled, the guards saluted, and the old
carriage drove away.
Then cnme his Transpareney the Duke and Transparent family, with
his great officers of state and household. IIe bowed serenely to every-
body. And amid the saluting of the guards, and the faring of the
torches of the running footmen, clad in scarlet, the Transparent carriages
drove away to the old Ducal Schloss, with its towers and pinnacles stand-
ing on the Schlossberg. Eerybody in Pumpernickel knew everybody.
566
VAMITY FAIB.
No sooner was a foreigner seen there, thanthe Ministur of Foreign Affairs,
or some other great or small officer of state, went round to the lrbprinz,
and found out the name of the new arrivals.
We watched them, too, out of the theatre. Tapeworm had just walked
off, enveloped in his cloak, with which his gigntic chasseur was always iu
attendance, and looking as much as possile like Don Jun. The rime
Minister's lady had just squeezed hersaelf into her sedan, and her daughter,
the charming Ida, had put on her calash anl clogs: when the English party
came out, the boy yawning drearily, tle Major taking great pains in keep-
ing the shawl over Mrs. Osborne's head, and Mr. Sedley looking grand,
with a crush opera-hat on one side of his head, and his hand in tle stomach
of a voluminous white waistcoat. We took off our hats to our aequaint-
ances of tlhe table d'ldie, and the lady, in return, presented us with a little
smile and a curtsey, for which everybody might be thankful.
The carriage from the inn, undcr the superintendence of the bustling
MIr. Kirsch, was in waiting to convey the party; but the fat man said he
would walk, and emoke his cigar on his way homewards; so the other
three, with nods and smiles to us, went withont Mr. Sedley. Hirsch,
with the cigar-case, following in lis aster's wake.
We all walked together, and talkel to the stout gentleman about the
agreiueus of the place. It was very agreeable for the English. There were
shooting-parties and battues; there was a plenty of halls and enter-
tainments at the hospitable Court; the society was generaly good,; the
theotre excellent, and thc living cheap.
And our Mlinister seems a most delightful and afable person,'' our uew
friend suid.  WVith such a representative, and-and a good medical man,
I can fancey the place to be most eligible. Good uight, gentlemen.'' And
Jos creaked up the stairs to bedwvard, followed hy kirsch with a flambeau.
W rather hoed that nice-looking woman would be induced to stay
son:e time in the town.

UCIHI polite behaviour as that of
Lord Tapeworm did not fail to
have the most favourable effect
upon Mr. Selley's miud, and the
very next moruing, at breakfast,
he pronouuced his opinion that
Pumpernickel was the pleasantest
little placee of any which they had
visited on their tour. Jos's
motives and artifices were not
very diffieult of comprehension:
and Dobbin lsughed in his aleeve,
like a hypocrite as he was, wvhen
he found by the kuowing air of
the Civilian and the off-hand
manner in which the latter talked
about Tapeworm Castle, and the
other members of the family, that
Jos had been up already in the
morning, consulting his travel-
ling Peerage. es, he had seen
the Right llonourable the Earl
of Bgwig, his lordship's Iather:
he was sure he had, he had met
lim at-at the Levee-didn't Dob remember and when the iplomatist
called on the party, faitlful to his promise, Jos received him with such a
salute and honours as were seldom aceorded to tle little Envoy. He
winked at Kirsch on his Excelleney's arrial, and that emissary instructed
beforehand, went out and superintended an entertainment of cold meats,
jellies, and other delicacies, brought in upon wrays, nnd of which Mr. Jos
absolutely insistel that his noble gusst should partake.
Tapeworm, so long as he could hae an opportunity of ndmiring the
bright eyes of Mrs. Osborne (whose freshness of coplexion bore daylight
remarkably well) was not ill pleased to aceepl any initation to stay in
568
yNITY FIR.
MIr. Sedley's lodgings; he put one or two dexterous questions to him
about Inlia and the duncing-girls thiere; asked Amelia about thnt beauti-
ful boy who had been with her, and complimented the astonished little
woman upon the prodigious sensatton which she had made in the house;
nnl tried to fuscinate Dobbin by talking of the late war, and the exploits of
the Pumperniekel contingent under the command of the lereditary Prince,
now Duke of Pumpernickel.
Lord Tapeworm inherited no little portion of the family allantry, and
it was his happy bclief, that alost every woman upon whom he himself
cast friendly eyes, was in love with him. He left Emmy under the per-
suasion that she was slain by his wit nnd attractions, and went home to
his lodgings to write a pretty little note to her. She was not fascinated;
only puzzled by his grinning, his simpering, his scented cambric hand-
kerchief, and his high-leeled laequered boots. She did not understand
one half the compliments which he pnid; she had never, in her small
expericnce of mnnkind, met a professional lady's man as yet, and looked
upon my lord as something curious rather than plensant; and if she did
not admire, certainly wondered nt him. Jos, on the coutrary, was de-
lighted.  1Iow very afble his Lordship is,'' he sid;  IIow ery kind
of his Lordship to say he would send his medical man. Kirsch, you will
carry our cards to the Count e Schliisselback direectly: the Mnjor and
I will hnve the greatest pleasure in paying our respects at Court as soon
as possible. lut out my uniform, Kirsch,-both our uniforms. It is a
mark of politeness which every English gentleman ought to show to the
countries whieh he sisits, to pay his respects to the sovereigns of those
contries as to the representatives of his own.''
When Tapeworm's doctor cnmc, Doetor von Glauber, Body TPlysician
to H.S.H. the Duke, hec speedily convinced Jos that the Pumpernickel
mineral springs and the Doctor's particular treatment would infallibly
restore the Bengalee to youth and slimness. ` Dere came here last year,''
he said,  Sheneral Bulkeley, an English Sheneral, tvice so pic as you, Sir.
I sent him baek qvite tin after tree months, and he danced id Buroness
Glauber at the end of two,''
Jos's mind was made up, the springs, the doctor, the Court, and the
Charge d' Affaires convincel him, and he proposel to spend the autumn in
these delightful quarters.-Anl punetual to his word, on the next day the
Charge d' Afaires presented Jos and the Major to Victor Aurelius XNVI.,
bcing conducted to their audience with that sovereigu by the Count de
tSchliuisselbaek, Marshal of the Court.
They were straightway invited to dinner at Court, and their intention of
staying in the town being announced, the politcst ladies of the whole
town instantly called upon Mrs. Osborne; and as not one of these, how-
ever poor they might be, was under the rauk of a lBaroness, Jos's delight
was beyond expression. He wrote off to Chutney at the Club to say that
the Service was highly appreciated in Germany, that he was going to show
lis friend, the Count de Schlisselback, how to stick a pig in the Indisn
fashion, and that his august friends, the Duke and Duehess, were every-
thiog that was kind and civil.

Emmy, too, was presented to the august faumily, and as mourning ias not
nditted in Court on certain days, sle appeared in a pink crape dress,
with n diamond ornament in the corsage, presented to her by her brother,
anl she looked so pretty in this costume that the Duke and Court (putting
out of the question the Major, who had scnarcely ever seen her before in an
vening dress, and vowed that she did not look five-and-twenty) all admired
her cexccssively.
In this dress she walked n Polonaise with Major Dobbin at n Court-
ball, in which easy dancee MIr. Jos had the honour of leading out the
Countess of Schliisselback, au old lady with a hump back, but with six-
teen good quarters of nobility, and related to half the royal houses of
Germany.
Pumperuickel stands in the midst of a happy valley, through which
sparkles-to mingle with the lhine somewhere, but I have not the map at
hnd to say exactly at wht point-the fertilising stream of the Pump.
In some plaees the river is big cnough to support a ferry-boat, in others
to tn a mill; in Pumpernickel itselt, the last lranspareney but three, the
grcat and renowned Victor Aurclius NIV., built a mgnificent bridge, on
which his own statue rises, surrounded by water-nymphs and emblems of
victory, peace andl plenty; he has his foot on the neck of a prostatc lurk
-history says he engsgel and ran n Janissary through the body at the
rlief of Vicnna by Sobicski,-but, quite unlisturbed by the agonies of that
prostrate Mahometan, wlo writles at his feet in the most ghastly mnner
-the Prince smiles blandly, and noints ith his truclcon in tlio direction
of the Aurelius Platz, where hc beg to cret a ncw palace that would
hve been the wonler of lis age,had th: gteat-souled 1'rice but funds to
complete it. But the completion of Mlonplaisir (lllziir the honest
(Gcrman folks call it) was stopp.d foer lack of realy moncy, and it and its
park and garden aure now in ratlur a fdd condition, l not more than
tecn times big enough to acencdate the Court of the reigning overeign.
The gardens were arranged to cmulate those of Versailles,  and amidst
the terraces and groves there arc somo huge allcgorical waterworks still,
which spout and froth stupendously upon fete-days, and frightn one
withi their enormous aquatic insurrections. There is the Troplonius' cae
in which, by some artifice, the leaden lritons are made not only to spout
water, but to play the most dreallul groans out of thcir lead conchs-
thuere is the Nymph-bath and the liagar cataraet, which the people of
tle neighbourhood admire beyond expression, when they come to the
yearly fair at the opening of the Chamber, or to the fetes with which the
happy little nation still celebrates the birth-days and marrisge-days of its
princely governors.
Then from all the towns of the Duchy which stretehes for nearly ten
milcs,-from Bolkum, which lies on its western frontier bidding defiance
to 1russia, from Grogwitz where the Prince has a hunting-lodge, and
where his dominions are separatel by the Pump river from those of the
neighbouring Prince of Potzenthal ; from all the little villages, which
besides these three great cities, dot over the happy Principulity-from
the farms and the mills along the Pump, come troops of people in red

petticoats and elvet head-dresses, or with three-eornered hats and pipes in
their mouths, who flock to the Residenz and share in the pleasures of the
fair and the festivities there. Then the theatre is open for notling, then
the waters of Monblaisir begin to play (it is lucky that there is company
to behold them for one would be afraid to see them alone)-then there
come mountebanks and riding troops (the way in which his Trssarenc
was fascinated by one of the horse-riders, is well kown, and it is
believed thnt ILa Petite oandiere, as she was called, was a spy in the
Freneh interest), and the delighted people are permitted to march through
room after room of the Grand Ducnl palace, and ndmire the slippery floor,
the rich hangings,nnd the spittoons at the doors of all the innumerable
chambers. There is oe Pavilion ast Mfonblaisir which Aurelius Victor
XV. had arranged-a great Prince but too fond of pleasure-and which
I am told is a perfect wonder of licentious elegance. It is painted with
the story of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the table works in and out of the
room by menns of a windlass so that the company was served without any
intervention of domestics. But the place was shut np by Barbars,
Aurelius XV.'s widow, a severe nnd dewout Princcss of the House of
lBolkum and Iegent of the Duchy during her son's glorious minority, and
after the leath of her husband, cut of in the pride of his pleasures.
The theatre of Pumnperuiekel is known and famous in that quarter of
Germany. lt languislel a little when the present Duke in his youth
insistel upon huving his own operas played there, and it is said one day,
in a fury from his place in the orchestra, when he attended a rcearsal,
broke a bassoon on the hend of the Chapel Master, whio was conducting,
and led too slow; and during which time the Duehess Sophia wrole
domestic comedies which must hae been very dreary to witness. But
the Prince executes his music in private now, and the Duchess only gies
away her plays to the foreigners of distinction who isit her kind littl
Court.
It is conducted with no small comfort and splendonr. WYhen there are
balls, though thcre may be four hundred people at supper, there is a serrant
in scarlet and lace to attend upon every fotr, and every one is sered on
siler. There are festivls and entertainents going continally on; and
the Duke has his ehamberlains and equerries, and the Duchess her mistress
of the wardrobe and ladies of honour just like any other and more notent
potentates.
The Constitution is or was a moderate despotism, tempered by a
Chamber that might or might not be elected. I neer certainly could
hear of its sitting in my time at Pumpernickel. The Prime Minister had
lolginge in n second floor; and the Foreign Becrelary occupied the com-
fortable lodgings over Zwieback's Conditorey. The army consisted ofas
magnificent band that also did duty on the stage, where it was quite
pleasant to see the worthy fellows rarching in urkish dresses with rouge
on and wooden scimetars, or as Roman warriors with ophicleiles and
trombones,-to see them again, I say, at night, after one had listened to
them all tle morning in the Aurelius Plats, where they performed opposite
the Cafd where we breakfasted. lBesides the band, there wss a rich and

nurerous staff of officers, and, I bclieve, a few men. Bcsides the regular
sentries, three or four men, habited as hussars, used to do duty at thc
Pulaee, but I never saw them on horsebaek, and u fit, what was the usc
of cavalry in n time of profound peace -and whither the deuce should

Everybody-everybody that was noble of course, for as for the Bour-
geois we could not quite be expected to tnke notice of then-visited
his neighbour. H. E. Mudame de HBurst received once a week, II. E.
Madnme de Schnurrbart hal hcr night-the theatre was open twice a
week, the Court grociously rcceived once, so that a man's life might in
fact be a perfect round of pleusure in the unpretenling umpernickel way.
Thnt there were feuds in the place, no one can deny. Politics ran very
high at Pumpernickel, and parties were very bitter. There was the
Strumnff fnction and the Lederlung purty, the one supported by our Envoy
and tlie other by the ench Charg d' Affuires, M de Macnbiu. Indeed
it sufficel for our Minister to stand up ior MIndnme Strumpff, who wns
clenrly the greatest singer of the two, and hnd three more notes in her
oice than Malame Iederlung her rival-it sufficed, I say, for our
Minister to uadvance aty opinion to have it instantly contradicted y
the French diplomatist.
Eeryboly in the town was ranged in one or othcr of these factions.
The Lelerlung was a prcettyish little creature certainly, and her voice,
(what there was of it,) was very sweet, nnd there is no doubt thnt the
Strumpff was not in her first youth and beauty, and certainly too stout;
when she came on in the last scene of the Bonnambula for instance in her
niglt-clemise with a lamp in her hnnd, and had to go out of the window,
and pass over the plank of the mill, it wns all sle could do to squeeze
out of the window, and the plank used to bend and creak again under her
weight-but how she poured out the finale of the operal and with what
a burst of feeling she rushed into lElvino's arms-nlost fit to smother
himl Whereas the little Lederlung-but a truce to this gossip-the
fact is, that these two women were the two flags of the Fench and the
English party at umpermnickel, and the society was dividel in its
allegiance to those two great nations.
We had on our side the Home Minister, the Master of the lIorse, the
Duke's Private Secretary, and the HPrince'a Tutor: whereas of the Freneh
party were the Foreign Minister, the Commander-in-chief's Lndy, who
hal served under Napoleon, and the Hof-Marschll and his wife, who was
glad enough to get the fashions from Paris, and always had them anl her
caps by M. de Macabau's courier. The Seeretary of his Chnuceery was
little Grignae, a young fellow, as malicious as Satan, and wl made

MInjor's windows, who had lodgings opposite uuder the Prime inister,
were ulways open to hear thce lesson. Some of the German ladies, wo
nre very sentimental and simple in their tastes, fell in love with her and
began to call her du at once. These are trivial details, but they relate to
happy times. The Major made himself George's tutor, and real Cesar
and mathematics with hi, and they had a German master and rode out
of evenings by the side of Emmy's earriage-she was always too timid, and

lovely Princess Amelia of Humbourg-Schlippensehloppen took plaee.
A NOVEL WITROUT A IIEB0.
At this festival the magnificence displayed was such as had not been
kowvn in the little German place sinee the days of the prodigal Victor XIV.,
All the neighbouring lrinces, Princesses, and Grandees were invitel to
the feast. Beds rose to half-a-erown per uight in Pumpernickel and thc
army was exhausted in providing guards of honour for the Highnesses,
Sereuities, aul Excellencies, who arried from aull quartcrs. The Princess
was married by proxy, at her father's residence, by the Count de Sellis-
scelbaek. Snuf-boxes were given uasy in profusion (as we learned from
the Court-jewellcr, who sold und afterwarls bought thcm again), und
bushels of the Order of Saint Michael of Pumperuickel were sent to the
nobles of the Court, wlile hampers of the cordons and decorations of tho
Wheel of St. Cutlerine of cllippenaclloppen were brougut to ours. The
French envoy got both. '` He is covered with ribbons like a prize cart-horse,''
Tapeworm said, who was not allowed by the rules of his service to tke
any decorations: '`Lct him have the cordons; but witl whom is the victory''
The fact is, it was a triumph of British liploacy: the French party
having proposed and tried their utmost to carry a arriage with a Prineess
of the house of Potztauscnd-Donncrwetter, whom, as a mattcr of course,
we opposed.
Eerybody was asked to the fetes of the mrriage. Garlands and
triumphal arches were hung aeross the rod to welcome the young bride.
The great aint MIichael's Pountain run with uncommonly saur wine,
wlile that in the Artillery Place frothed witl beer. he great waters
played; and poles were put up in the park and gardens for the lappy
peasautry, which they might climb at their leisure, carrying olf watches,
silver forks, prize sausages huug with pink ribbon, &e., at the top.
Georgy got one, wrencling it off, having swarmed up the pole to the
delight of the spectators, and sliding down with the rupidity of u fall of
water. But it was for the glory's sake merely. The boy gave the susage
to a peasant, who had very nearly seized it, and stood at the foot of the
mast, blubbering, because he was unsuceessful.
At the French Chnneellerie they had six more lampions in their illumi-
nation thnn our's had; but our transpareney, which represented the young
Couple advancing, andl Discord flying away, with the most ludicrous like-
ness to the Freuch ambassador, beat the French picture hollow; and I
have no doubt got Tapeworm the advunceent and the Cross of the Bath,
which he subsequently attained.
Crowds of foreigners arrived for the fetes : and of English of course.
Besides thc Court balls, publie balls were given at the Town lIall and the
Redoute, and in the former place there was a room for trente-et-guarante
and roulette established, for the week of the fcstivities only, and by one of
the great Geran companies from Ems or Aix-la-Chnpelle. The otficcrs or
inhabitants of the town were not allowed to play at these games, but
strangers, peasants, adies were aditted, and anyone who chose to lose
or win money.

courier, Mr. Kirsch, and having only peeped into a play-room at Baden
Baden when he hung on Dobbin's arm, and wlere, of course, he was not
permitted to gamble, came eagerly to this part of the entertainment, and
hankered round the tables where the crompiers and the punters were at work.
Women were playing; they were masked, some of them; this license was
nllowed in these wild times of carnival.
A woman with light hair, in a low dress, by no means so fresh as it lad
been, and with a black mask on, through the eyelets of which her eyes
twinkled strangely, waas sented at one of the roulette-tables with a card
and a pin, and a couple of florins before her. As the croupier called ont
the colour and nnmber, she pricked on the card with great care and regu-
larity, and only ventured her money on the colours after the red or
black had come up a certain number of times. It wns strange to look at
her.
But in spite of her care and assiduity she guessed wrong, and the last
two florins followed each other under the croupicr's rake, as he cried out
with his inexorable voice, the winning colour and nnmber. She gavea
sigh, a shrug with her shoulders, which were already too much out of her
gown, and dashing the pin through the card on to the table, sat thrum-
ining it for a wlile. Then she looked round her, and saw Georgy's honesl
face staring at the scene. lhe little scampl what business had he to be
there
When she saw the oy, at whose face she looked hard through her
shining eyes and mnsk, she said, `` Monsieur n'est psjoueur.''
Non, Mfadae,'' said the boy: but she must ave known, from his
accent of what country he was, for she answered him with a slight foreign
tone. `You hnve nevare played-will you do me a littl' fasor''
 What is it'' anid Georgy, blushing again. Mr. Kirsch was at sork
for his part at the rouge et noir, and did not see his young master.
`Ply this for me, if you please, put it on muy number, any number.''
hnd she took from her bosom a purse, and out of it a gold piece, the only
coin there, nnd she put it into George's hand. The boy laughed, and did
as he was bid.
It came up the number sure enough. There is a power that arranges
that, they say, for beginners.
Thank you,'' sid she, pulling the money towards her; `` thank ou.

My name's Osborne,'' said Georgy, and was fingering in his o
pockets for dollars, and just about to make a trial, when the Masjor,
in his uniform, and Jos, en Marouis, from the Court ball, made their
appearance. Other people finding the entertainment stupid, and preferring
the fun at the Stadthnus, hal quitted the Palace ball earlier; but it is
probable the Major and Jos hd gone home and found tle boy's absenee,
for the formner instantly went up to him, and taking him by the shoulder,
pulled him briskly bck from the place of temptation. Then, looking round
the room, he snw Nirstch employed as we hae said, anu going up to him,

Seeing his condition the Major did not choose to argue with the man;
but contented himself with drawing away George, ad asking Jos if ho
would come away. He wss standing close by the lady in the mask, who
was playing with pretty good luck now; and looking on much interested
at the gme.
'Had 'nt you better come, Jos,'' the Major said, `with George
and me''
 I'Il stop and go home with that rascal, Kirsch,'' Jos said; and for
the same reason of modesty, which he thought ought to be preserved
before the boy, Dobbin did not ere to remonstrate with Jos, but left him
and walked lome with Gcorgy.
 Did you play ?'' askel the Major, when they were out, and on their
way home.
he boy snid ` No.''
t Gie me your word of honour as a gentleman, thnt you never will,''
 WYhy P'' said the boy: `' It seems very gool Iun,'' And, in a very
eloquent and impressive manner, the Major showed him why he shoull 'nt,
nnd woull have enforced his prccepts by the example of Georgy's own father,
hnd he liked to say anything that should refleet on the other's memory.
When he had housed him he went to bed, and saw his light, in the little
room outside of Amelia's, presently disappear. Amelia's followed half an
hour afterwnrds. I don't know what made the Mnjor note it so
nccuratcly.
Jos, lowever, remaincd ohind over the play-table; he was no gambler,
but not averse to tle little excitement of the sport now and then; and he
had some Napoleons chinking in the embroidered pockets of his court
waistcot. Ie put down one over the fair shoulder of the little gambler
before him, and they won. She made a little movement to make room
for him by her sile, and just took the skirt of her gown from a vacnnt
chair there.
Come and give me goo luek,'' she sid, still in a foreign accent, quite
lifferent from that frank anl perfectly English  Thank you,'' with which
she had snluted Gcorgy's cop in her favour. The portly gentleman,
looking round to see that nobody of rank observed him, sat down; he
muttered-'`Ah, really, well now, Got bless my soul, I'm very fortunate;
I'm sure to give you good fortune,''-and other words of compliment tund
confusion.
Do you play much'' the foreign mask said.
'I put a Nap or two down,'' said Jos, with a superb air, flinging down
a gold piece.
eYes; ay nap after dinner,'' said the mask, arclly. But Jos looking
frigltenel, she continued, in her pretty French ccent, ` You do ot play

it is labour lost to look into it ever so curiously. They look pretty
enough when they sit upon a rock, twanging their harps and combing
their hair, and sing, and beckon to you to come and hold the looking-
glass; but when they sink into their natie element, depend on it those
mermaids are about no good, and we had best not examine the fiendish
marine cannibals, revelling and feasting on their wretched piekled victims.
And so, when Becky is out of the way, be sure that she is not partieularly
well employed, and that the less that is said about her doings is in fet
the better.
If we were to give a full account of her proceedings during a couple of
yers that followed after the Curzon Street catastrophe, there might be
some reason for people to say this book was improper. The actions of
very vain, heartless, pleasure-seeking people are very often improper (as
are many of yours, my friend with the grave face and spotless reputation;
-but that is merely by the way); and what are those of a woman withont
faith-or love-or character And I am inclined to think that there wasa
period in Mrs. Becky's life, when sle was seized, not by remorse, but by
a kind of despair, and absolutely neglected her person, and did not een
care for her reputation.
This aattement and degradation did not take plaee all at onee: it wss
brought about by degrees, after her cslamity, and after many struggles t
keep up-as a man who goes overboard hangs on to a spar whilst any
hope is left, and then flings it away and goes down, when he finds that
struggling is in vain.
She lingered about London whilst her husband was making preparations
for his departure to his seat of government: and it is believed msde more
than one attempt to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, and to work
upon his feelings which she had almost enlisted in her favour. As Sir
Pitt nnd Mr. Wenham were walking down to the House of Commons, the
lntter spied Mrs. Rawdon in a black veil, and lurking near the palace of
the legislature. Bhe sneaked away when her eyes met those of Wenham,
and indeed never sueceeded in her designs upon the Baronet.
Probably Lady Jane interposed. Ihave heard that she quite sstonished
her husband by the spirit which she exhibited in this quarrel, and her
determination to disown Mrs. Becky. Of her own movement, she invitad
Rawdon to come and stop in Gaunt Street until his departure for
Coventry Island, knowing that with him for a guard Mrs. Beecky would
not try to force her door: and she looked curiously at the superscriptions
of all the letters which arrived for Sir Pitt, lest he and his sister-in-law
should be eorresponding. Not but that Rebeeca could have written had
she a mind: but she did not try to see or to write to Pitt at his own
house, and after one or two attempts consented to his demand that the
orrespondence regarding her conjugal differences shonld be carried on by
lawyers only.
The fact was, thnt Pitt's mind had been poisoned against her. A short
time nfter Lord Steyne's aecident Wenham had been with the Baronet;
and gien him such a biography of Mrs. Beeky as had astonished the
member for ueen's Crawley. He knew everything regarding her: who
her father was; in what year her mother danced at the Opera; what had

been her previous history, and what her conduct during her married life:
-as I have no doubt that the greater part of the story was false and dic-
tated by interested malevolence, it shall not be repeated here. But Becky
was left with a sad sad reputation in the esteem of a country gentleman
and relative who had been once rather partial to her.
The revenues of the Governor of Coventry island are not large. n part
of them were set aside by his Excellenecy for the payment of certain out-
standing debts and liabilities, the churges incident on his high situation
required considerable expense; finally, it was found that he could not
spara to his wife more than three hundred pounds a year, which he pro-
posed to pay to her on an undertaking tht she would never trouble
him. Otherwise: scandal, separation, Doctors' Commons would ensue.
But it was Mr. Wenham's business, Lord Steyne's business, Rawdon's,
everybody's-to get her out of the country, and hush up a most dis-
agreeable affair.
She was probably so much oceupied in arranging theee affairs of business
with her husband's lawyers, that she forgot to take any step wlatever
about her son, the little Rawdon, and did not even onee propose to go
and see him. That young gentleman was consigned to the entire
guardianship of his aunt and unele, the former of whom hal always
possessed a great share of the chill's affection. His mamma wrote him
a neai letter from Boulogne when she quitted England, in which she
requested him to mind his book, and said ahe was going to tnke a Conti-
nental tour, during which she wonld have the pleasure of writing to him
again. But she never did for a year afterwards, and not, indeed, until
Sir Pitt's only boy, always sickly, died of hooping-eough and measles;-
then Rawdon's mamma wrote the most afectionate eomposition to her
darling son, who was made heir of ueen's Crawley by this aecident, and
drawn more closely than ever to the kind lady, whose tender heart had
already adopted him. Rawon Crawley, then grown a tall, fine lad,
blushed when he got the letter. `Oh Aunt Jane, you are my mother1''
he sid; `'`and not-and not that one'' But le wrote back a kind and
respectful letter to Mrs. Rebeeca, then living at a boarding-house at
Florence.-But we are adancing mattere.
Our darling Beeky's first flight was not very far. She perched npou
the French eoast at Boulogne, that refuge of so much exiled English
innocence ; and there lived in rather a genteel, widowed manner, with a
femse de clamre and a couple of rooms, at an hotel. She dined at
the talle d'Idte, where people thought her very pleasant, and where
she entertained her neighbours by stories of her brother, Sir Pitt, and
her great London acuaintancee; talking that easy, fashionable slipslop,
which has so much effect upon certain folke of amall breeding. She
passed with msny of them for a perso of importanee; she gave little
tea-parties in her private room, and shared in the innocent amnsements
of the plaee,-in sea-bathing, and in jaunts in open carriages, in strolls on
the sands, and in visits to the play. Mrs. Burjoice, the printer's lay,
who was boarding with her family at the hotel for the summer, and to
whom her Burjoice came of a Saturday and Bunday, voted her charming;
until that little rogue of a Burjoice began to pay her too much attention.

But there was nothing in the story, only that Becky was always affuble,
casy, and good-natured-and with men especially.
Numbers of people were going abroad as usul at the end of the
season, and Becky had plenty of opportunities of finding out by the
behaviour of her acquaintances of the great London world the opinion of
`society'' as regarded her conduet. One day it was Lady Partlet and
her daughters whom Becky confronted as she was walking modestly on
Boulogue pier, the clifs of Albion shining in the distance across the deep
blue sea. Lady artlet mrshalled all her daughters round her with a
sweep of her parasol, and retreated from the pier darting savage glanees
at poor little Becky who stood alone there.
On another day the packet came in. It had been blowing fresh, and it
always suited Becky's humour to see the droll woe-begone faces of the
people as they emerged from the bont. Lady lingstone happened to be
on board this dy. Her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her carriage,
and was greatly exhausted and scarcely fit to walk up the plnk from the
ship to the pier. But all her energies rallied the instant she saw Beeky
smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet : and giving her a glance of scorn,
such as would have shrivelled up most women, she walked into the
Custom IIouse quite unsupported. Becky only laughed: but I don't
think she liked it. She felt she was alone, quite alone; and the far-off
shining cliffs of England were impassable to her.
The behaviour of the men had undergone too I don't know what change.
Grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity
that was uot pleasant. Little Bob Suekling, who was cap in hand to her
three months before, and would walk a mile in the rain to see for her
carriage in the line at Gaunt House, was talking to Fitzoof of the Guards
(Lord IIeehaw's son) one day upon the jetty, as Becky took her walk
there. Little Bobby nodded to her over his shoulder without moving his
hat, and continued his conversation with the heir of Heehaw. Tom Raikes
tried to walk into her sitting-room at the inn with a cignr in his mouth;
but she closed the door upon him and would have locked it only that his
fingers were inside. She began to feel that she was very lonely indeed.
 If Me'd been here,'' she said, `` those cowards would never havc dared to
insult me,'' She thought about `` him'' with great sadness, and perhaps
longing-about his honest, stupid, constant kindness and fidelity: his
neer-ceasing obedience; his good humour; his bravery and courage.
Very likely she cried, for he was particularly lirely, and had put on a
little extra rouge when she came down to dinner.
She rouged regularly now: and-and her maid got Cognae for her
besides that which was chnrged in the hotel bill.
Perhnps the insults of the men were not, however, so intolerable to hen
ns the sympathy of certain women. Mrs. Crackenbury and Mrs. Wash-
ington White passed through Boulogne on their wsy to Switserland.
(The party were protected by Colonel Horner, young Beaumoris, and of
course old Crackeubury, and Mrs. White's little girl.) Tley did not avoid
hcr. They giggled, cackled, tattled, condoled, consoled, and patronised
her until they drove her almost wild with rage. To be patronised by ten l

heard Beaumoris's laugh ringing on the stair, and knew quite well how to
interpret his hilarity.
It was after this visit that Becky, who had paid her weekly bills,
Becky who had made herself agreeable to every boly in the house, who
smiled at the landlady, cnlled the waiters '` Monsicur,'' and paid the cham-
hermaids in politeness and apologies, what fhar more tlan compensated for a
little niggardliness in point of money (of which Becky never wns free), that
Becky, we say, received a notice to quit from the landlord, who had been
told by some one that she wnas quite an unfit person to have at his hotel,
where English lndies would not sit down with her. And she was forced
to fly into lodgings, of which thc dullness and solitude were most
wearisome to her.
Still she held up, in spite of these rebuffs, and tried to mke a character
for herself, and conquer scandal. She went to church very regularly, and
sang louder than anybody there. She took up the cnuse of the widows
of the shipwrecked fishermen, and gave work and drawings for the
uashyboo Mission ; she subseribed to the Assembly, and seould't waltz.
In a word, she did everything that was respectable, and that is why we
dwell upon this part of her cnreer with more fondness than upon subse-
quent parts of her history, which nre not so pleasant. She saw peoplc
avoiding her, nnd still lnboriously smiled upon them; you never eould
suppose from ler countenance what pangs of humiliation she might be
enduring inwardly.
Her history was after all a mystery. Parties were divided about er.
Bome people, who took the trouble to busy themselees in the matter, said
that she was the criminal; whilst others voweld that she was as innocent
as a lamb, and thnt her odious husband was in fault. She won over a
good many by bursting into tenrs about her boy, and exhibiting the most
frantic grief when his name was mentioned, or she saw nnybody like him.
She gained good Mrs. Alderney's heart in that way, who was rather the
ueen of British Boulogne, and gave the most dinners and balls of all the
residents there, by wecping when Master Alderney came from Doctor Sish-
tail's academy to pass his holilays with his mother.  He and her Ruawdon
were of the same age, and ao like,'' Becky said, in a voice choking with
agonuy; whereas there was five years' difference between the boys' ages,
and no more likeness between them than between my respected render and
his humble servant. Wenham, when he was going abroad, on his way to
Kissingen to join Lord Steyne, enlightened Mrs. Alderney on this point,
and told her how he was much more nble to deseribe little Rawdon than
his mamma, who notoriously hated him, and never snw him; how he was
thirteen years old, while little Alderney was but nine; fair, while the
other darling was dnrk,-in a word, esused the lady in question to repent
of her good humour.
Whenever Becky made a little circlo for herself with ineredible toils
and labour, somebody came and swept it down rudely, and she had all
her work to begin oer again. It was very hard : very hard : lonely, and
disheartening.

nations, that intimacy between Mrs. Newbright and Mrs. Crawley cease
forthwith: and all the serious world of Tours, where this misfaortune toak
place, immediately parted company with the reprobate. Those who kno
the English Colonies abroad know that we carry with us our pride, pills,

From one colony to another Becky fled uneasily. rom Boulogue to
Dieppe, from Dieppe to Caen, from Caen to Tours-trying with all her
might to be respectable, and alasl always found out some dasy or other,
and pecked out of the cage by the real daws.
Mrs. Hook Eagles took her up at one of these placees:-a woman thout
a blemish in her character, and a house in Portman-equnre. She was
staying at the hotel at Dieppe, whither Becky fled, and they made each
other's aeqaintanee first at sea, where they were swimming together, and
subsequently at the talle 'Mdte of the hotel. Mrs. Eagles had heard,-who
indeed had not '-some of the scandal of the Steyue afair; but after a
conversation with Becky, she pronounced that Mrs. Crawley was an angel,
her husband a ruffian, Lord Steyne an unprincipled wretch, as evrerybody
knew, and the whole case against Mrs. Crawley, an infamous and wicked
eonspiracy of that rascal Wenham. 'If you were a man of any spirit,
Mr. Eaglcs, you would box the wretchs ears the next time you see him at
the Club,'' she said to her husband. But Eagles was only a quiet old
gentleman, husband to Mrs, Eagles, with a taste for geology, and not tall
enough to reach anybody's ears.
The Eagles then patronised Mrs. Rawdon, took her to live with her
at her own house at Paris, quarrelled with the ambassador's wife becanse
she would not receive her protede, and did all that lay in woman's power
to keep Becky straight in the paths of virtue and good repute.
Becky was very respectable and orderly at first, but the life of humdrum
virtue grew utterly tedious to her before long. It wns the same rontine
every day, the same dullness and comfort, the sme drive over the same
tupid Bois de Boulogne, the same company of an evening, the same
Blair's Sermon of a Sunduy night-the same opera always being acted
over and over again : Becky was dying of weariness, when, luckily for
her, youug Mr. llagles came from Cambridge, nnd his mother, seeing the
impression which her little friend made upon him, straightway gae Becky
warning.

Then she tried keeping house with a female friend; then the double
menage began to quarrtel and get into debt. Then she determined upon a
boarding-house existence, and lied for some time at that famous mansion
kept by Madame de Saint Amour, in the Rue Boyale, at Paris, where she
began exercising her graees and fascinations upon the ahabby dandies
and fly-blown beauties who frequented her lanllady's alon. Becky loved
society, and, indeed, could no more exist without it than an opium-eater
without his dram, and she was happy enough at the period of her boarding-
house life,  The women here are as amusing as those in sy-fair,'' ahe
told an old London friend who met her-''`only, their dresses are ot
quite so fresh. The men wear cleaned gleves, nnd are sad rogues, cer-
tainly, but they are not wore than Jack This, and Tom That. The
mistress of the house is a little vulgar, but I don't think she is so vulgar
as Lady -'' and here she named the name of a great leader of
fashion that I would die rather than reveal. In fact, when you saw
Madae de Saint Amour's rooms lighted up of a uight, men with plaes
and cordons at the eearte tables, and the women at a little distunce, you
might Iancy yourself for a while in good society, and that Madame was a
real Countess. MIany people did so fancy : and Becky was for a while
one of the most dashing ladies of the Countess's asalons.
But it is probable that her old creditors of 1815 found her out and
caused her to leave Paris, for the poor little woman was forced to fly from
the city rather suddenly; and went thence to Brussels.
IIow well she remembered the placel She grinned ss she looked up at
the little entresol which she had oecupied, and thought of the Bareacres
family, bawling for horses and flight, as their carriage stood in the porte-
coelere of the hotel. he went to Waterloo and to Lscken, where
George Osbome's monument mnch struck her. She mde a little sketeh
of it. : That poor Cupid 1'' she said; ``how dreadfully he was in loe
with me, and what a fool he wasl I wonder whether little Emmy is
alive. It was a good little creature: and that fat brother af her's. I
have his funny fat picture still among my papers. They were kind simple
people.''
At Brussels Becy arrived, reeemmended by Madsme de aint Amour
to her friend, Madame Ia Comtesse de Borodino, widow of Napoleon's
General, the famous Count de Borodino, who was left with no resource by
the deceased hero but that of a talle-d'ldte and an ecarte table. Second-
rate dandies and rouei, widow-ladies who always have a la-suit, and very
simple Lnglish folks, who fancy they see `` Continental society'' at these
houses, put down their money, or ate their meals, at Madame de Boro-
dino's table. At the tall-'I6te the gallant young fellows treated the
company romnd to champagne, rodo out with the women, or hired horses
on country excursions, clubbed money to take boxes at the play or the
Opera, betted over the fair shoulders of the lsdies at the eeurte' tables,
and wrote home to their parents, in Devonshire, about their felicitous
introduction to foreign soeiety.
Here, as at Paris, bBecky was a boarding-house queen: and ruled in
select pensins. She never refused the champagae, or the bouquets, or the
drives into the country, or the priate boxes; but what she preferred was

When Becky left Brussels, the sad truth is, that she owed three months'
peneion to Madame de Borolino, of which fact, and of the gmbling, and
of the drinking, and of the going down on her knees to the keverend Mr.

other knaveries, the Countess de Borodino informs every English person
who stops at her establishment, and announces that Madame Rawdon was
no better than a vipere.
So our little wanderer went about setting up her tent in various cities
of Europe, as restless as Ulysses or Bampfylde Moore Carew. Her taste
for disrespectability grew more and more remarkable. She became a
perfect Bohemian ere long, herding with people whom it would make your
hair stand on end to meet.
There is no town of any mark in Europe but it has its little colony of
English raffs-men whose names Mr. Hemp the officer reads out peri-
odically ut the Sheriffs' Court-young gentlemen of very good family
often, only that the latter disowns them ; frequenters of billiard-rooms
nnd estaminets, patrons of foreign races and gaming-tables. They people
the debtors' prisons-they drink and swugger-they fght and brawl-
they run away without pnying-they have duels with krench and German
officers-they cheat Mr. Spooney at ecarte-they get the money, and
rive off to Bnden in mngnificent britzkns-they try their iufallible
martingale, and lurk about the tnbles with empty pockets, slabby
bullies, penniless bueks, until they can swindle a Jcw banker with a sham
bill of exchange, or find another Mr. Spooney to rob. The alternations of
splendour and misery which these people undergo are very queer to view.
Their life must be one of great excitement. Becky-must it be owned
-took to this life, and took to it not unkindly. She went about from town
to town among these Bohemians. The lucky Mrs. Rawdon was known
at every play-table in Germany. She and Madame de Cruchecasse kept
house at Florence together. It is said she was ordered out of Munich;
und my friend Mr. Frederie Pigeon avers that it was at her louie at
Lausanne that he was hocussed at supper and lost eight hundred pounds
to Major Loder and the Hlonourable Mr. Deuceace. We are bound, you
see, to give some account of Becky's biography ; but of this part, the less,
perhaps, that is said tle better.
They say, that when Mrs. Crawley was particularly down on her luck,
she gave concerts and lessons in music here and there. here was a
Madame de Raudon, who certainly had a matinee musicale at Wildbad,
aecompanied by Herr Spof, premier pianist to the Hospodar of Wallaschia,
and my little friend Mr. Eaves, who knew cvery body, and had travelled
everywhere, alwaye used to declare that he was at Strasburg in tle year
1830, when a ceertain Madame Rebecque made her appearance in the opera
of the Dame Blanele, giving occasion to a furious row in the theatre there.
She was hissed off the stage by the audience, partly from her own incom-
petency, but chiefly from the ill-advised sympathy of some persons in the
parget, (where the officers of the garrison had their admissions); and
Eaves was certain thnt the unfortunate dednutante in question was no other
than Mrs. Rawdon Crawley.
Bhe was, in faet, no better than a vagabond upon this enrth. When she
got her money she gambled; when she had gambled it she was put tao
shifts to lie; who knows how or by what means she succeededf It
is said that she once was seen at St. Petersburgh, but was summarily
dismissed from that capital by the police, so that there cunnot be any

possibility of truth in the report that she ws a Russian spy at Topits
and Vienna afterwards. I hae even been informed, that at Paris she
discovered as relation of her own, no less s person than her maternnl grand-
mother, who was not by any means a Montmorenei, but a hideous old
box-opener at a theatre on the Boulevards. The meeting between them,
of which other persons, as it is hinted elsewhere, seem to have been
acquainted, must have been a very affecting interview. The present
historian can give no certain details regarding the event.
It happened at ome once, that Mrs. de Rawdon's half-year's aslary
had just been paid into the principal banker's there, and, as every body
who had a balanee of above five hundred scudi ws invited to the balls
whieh this prince of merchants gave dnring the winter, Becky had the
honour of a card, and appeared at one of the Prince and Princess Polonis'a
splendid evening entertainments. The Princess was of the family of
Pompili, lineall descended from the second king of RBome, and Egeria of
the house of Olympus, while the Prince's grandfather, Alessandro Poloni,
sold wash-balls, essences, tobacco, and pocket-handkerehiefs, ran errands
for gentlemen, and lent money in a small way. All the great company in
Rome thronged to his saloons-Princes, Dukes, Ambsesdors, artits,
fiddlers, monainori, young bears with their lesders-every rnk and con-
dition of man. His halls blazed with light and msgnificenee; were respke-
dent with gilt frames, (containing pictures) and dubious antiques; and the
enormous gilt crown and arms of the princely owner, a gold mushroom ona
crimson field (the ocolour of the poeket-handkerchiefs which he sold), and
the silver fountain of the Pompili family shone all over the roof, doons,
and panels of the house, and over the grand velvet baldauins preparod
to receive Popes and Emperors.
So Becky, who had arrived in the diligence from Rlorence, and was
lodged at an inn in a very modest way, got a card for Prinee Polonia's
entertainment, and her maid dressed her with unusual care, and he went
to this fine ball leaning on the arm of Major Loder, with whom she
happened to be traelling at the time; (the same man who shot Prince
Ravioli at Naples the next year, and was caned by Sir John Buckskin far
carrying four kings in his hat besides those which he used in playing at
arle,)-and this pair went into the rooms together, and Beeky asw a
number of old faces which she remembered in happier dsys, when ehe was
not innocent, but not found out. Msijor Loder knew a great number df
foreigners, keen-looking whiskered men with dirty striped ribbons in their
button-holes, and a very small display of linen; but his own, ecountrymen,
it might he remarked, eschewed the Major. Becky, too, knew some
ladies bere and there-French widows, dubions Italian countesses, whoee
huslnds had treated them ill-faugh-what shall we say, we who hsve
moved among some of the finest compny of Vanity RFair, of this refuse
and sediment of rascnls? If we play, let it be with elean crds, and not
with this dirty pack. But every man who has formed one of the innumer-
able army of travellers has seen these marauding irregulars hanging on,
like Nym and Pistol, to the main foree; wearing the king's colours, and
bonsting of his commission, but pillagiug for themseles, and oeesionally
gibbeted by the road-side.

Well, ahe was hanging aon tha arm of Msjor Loder, and they went
through the rooms together, and drank a great quantity of champagne at
the buffet, here the people, and especially the Major's irregular eorps,

nough, they pushed on until they reached the Duchess's own pink velet
aloeon, at the end of the suite of apartments (where the statue of the
Venns is, and the great Yenice looking-glasses, framed in silver,) and where
the princely family were entertaining their most distinguished guests at a
round table at supper. It was just such a little select banquet as that of
which Becky recollected that she had partaken at Lord Steyne's-and
there he sat at Polonis's table, and she saw him.
The scsr cut by the diamond on his white, bald, shining forehead, made
a burning red mark; his red whiskers were dyed of a purple hue, which
made his pale face look still paler. He wore his collar and orders, his
hlue ribbon and garter. He was a greaster prinee than any there, though
there was a reigning duke and a royal highness, with their prineesses, and
near his lordship was seated the beautiful Countess of-Belladonna, ee
le Glandier, whose huaband (the Count Paolo della Belladonna) so well
known for his brilliant entomological collections, had been long abeent on
a mission to the Emperor of Morocco.

vAITY FAIR.
When Becky beheld that familiar and illustrious face, how ulgar all of
a sudden dit Major Loder appear to her, and how that odious Captain
Rook did smell of tobaeccol In one instant she reasssumed her fine-lady-
ship, and tried to look and feel as if she was in May Fair onee more.
tThat woman looks stupid and ill-humourel,'' she thought;` I am sure
she can't amuse him. No, he must be bored by her-he never was by
me,'' A hundred auch touching hopes, fears, and memories palpitated in
her little heart, as she looked with her brightest eyes (the rouge which she
wore up to her eyelids made them twinkle) towards the great nobleman.
Of a Star anl Garter night Lord Steyue used also to put on his grandest
manner, and to look and speak like a great prince, as he was. Becky
admired him smiling sumptuously, easy, lofty, and stately. Ah, os dies,
what a pleasant companion he was, what a brilliant wit, what a rich fund
of talk, what a grand mannerl-and she had exchanged this for Masjor
Loder, reeking of cigars and brandy-and-water, and Captain ook with
his horse-jockey jokes and prize-ring slang, and their like. I wonder
whether he will know me,'' she thought. Lorl Steyne was talking and
laughing with a great and illustrious lady at his side, when he looked
up and saw Beeky.
She was all over in a flutter as their eyes met, and she put on the very
best smile she could muster, and dropped him a littlie, timid, imploring
curtsey. He stared aghast at her for a minute, as Macbeth might on
beholding Banquo' s sudden appearance at his ball-supper; and remainel
looking at her with open mouth, when thst horrid Major Loder pulled
her away.
Come away into tle supper-room, Mrs. R.,'' was that gentleman's
remark; '`seeing these nobs grubbing away has made me peckish too.
Let's go and try the old governor's champgue.'' Becky thought the
Major had had a great deal too much already.
The duy ufter she went to walk on the Pincian Hill-the Hyde Park
of the Romun idlers-possibly in hopes to have another sight of Lord
Steyne. But she met another acquaintance there : it was Mr. iehe, his
lordship's confidential man, who came up nodding to her rather familiarly,
nnd putting a finger to his hat.  I knew that Madme was here,'' he said;
e I followed her from her hotel. I hasve some advice to give Madame,''
 From the Marquis of Steyne ?'' Becky asked, resuming as much of her
dignity as she could muster, and not a little agitatel by bope and
expectation.
 No,'' said the valet; `` it is from me. Rome is very unwholesome.''
eeNot nt this season, Mosieur Fiche,-not till after Easter.''
I tell Madame it is unwholesome now. There is always malaria for
some people. That crsed marsh wind kills many at all seasons. Look,
Madume Crawley, you were always on enfant, and I hae an interest in
you, parole d'lonnenr. Be warned. Go away from Rone, I tell yon-or
you will be ill and die,''
Becky laughed, though in rage and fury. eWhatl assassinate poor

him. I havc those who will defed me whilst I am here,''

It was Monsieur Fiche's turn to laugh now. Defend you,'' he said,
`'and whoP The Major, the Captain, any one of those gambling men
whom Madame sees, would take her life for a hundred Louis. We know

of her furies.
O, it was Madame de Belladonna, was it2'' Becky said, relieved a
little, for the information she had just got had scarel her.
t No-she does not matter-she is always jealous. I tell you it was
Monseigneur. You did wrong to show yourself to him. And if you stay
here you will repent it. Mark my words. Go. Here is my lord's car-
riage ''-anl seizing Beeky's arm, he rushed own an alley of the garden
as Lord Steyne's barouche, blazing with heraldic devices, came whirling
along the avenue, borne by the almost priceless horses, and bearing
Malame de Belladonna lolling on the cushions, dark, sulky, and blooming,
n King Charles in her lap, a white parasol swaying over her hend, and
old Steyne stretehed at her side with a livid face and glastly eyes. HIate, or
anger, or desire, caused them to brighten now and then still ; but
ordinarily, they ge no light, and seemed tired of looking out on a world
of which almost all the pleasure and all the best beauty had palled upon
the worn-out wicked old man.
 Monseigneur has never recovered the shock of that night, never,''
Monsieur Fiche whispered to Mrs. Crawley as the carriage flashed by,
nnd she peeped out at it from behind the shrubs that hid her. '` That was
n consolation at any rate,'' Becky thought.
Whethcr my lord really had murderous intentions towards Mrs. Becky,
as Monsieur Fiche said-(sinee Monseigneur's death he has returned to
his ntive country, where he lives much respectel, and, has purchsed
from his Prinee the title of Baron Ficci),-and the factotum objeeted to
have to do with assassination; or whether he simply had a commission to
frighten Mrs. Crawley out of a city where his lordship proposed to pass the
winter, and the sight of her would be eminently disagreeable to the great
nobleman, is a point which has never been ascertained: but the threat,
had its effect upon the little woman, and she sought no more to intrude
herself upon the presence of her old patron.
Everybody knows the melancholy end of that nobleman, which befel at
Naples two months after the French Revolution of 1830: when the Most
Honourable George Gustavus, Marquis of Steyne, Earl of Gaunt and of
Gaunt Castle, in the Peerage of Ireland, Viscount Hellborough, Baron
Piteley anl rilsby,  night o the Most Nohle Order of the rter.
of the Golden Fleece of Spain, of the Russian Order of Sint Nicholas
of the First Class, of the Turkish Order of the Crescent, First Lord of the
Powder Closet and Groom of the Back Stairs, Colonel of the Gaunt or
590
Regent's Own Regiment of Militia, a Trustee of the British Muenm, an
elder Brother of the Trinity House, a Governor of the White Friars, and
D,C.L.,-died, after a series of fits, brought on, as the papers said, by the
shock occasioned to his lordship's sensibilities by the downfall af the
ancient French monarchy.
An eloquent catalogue appeared in a weekly print, deseribing his virtes,
his magnificenee, his talents, and his good actions. His asensibility, his
nttachment to the illustrious Honse of Bourbon, with which he clsimed an
allianee, were sueh that he could not surive the misfortunes of his angust
kinsmen. His body was buried at Naples, and his heart-that heart
which always beat with every generous nd noble emotion-was brought
back to Castle Gaunt in a silver urn.  In him,'' Mr. Wagg ssid, `'the
poor and the Fine Arts have lost a beeficent patron, society one of its
most brilliant ornnments, and England one of her loftiest pstriota and
statesnen,'' c., &c.
His will wss a good deal disputed, and an attempt was made to faree
from Madame de Belladonna the oelebrated jewel clled the `` Jew's-eye''
diamond, which his lordship always wore on his forefinger, and which it
was said that she removed from it after his lamented demise. But his
confidential friend and attendsnt, Monsieur Fiche, proved that the ring
had been presented to the said Madame de Belladonna two dsys before the
marquis's death; as were the bank notes, jewels, Neapolitan and Rreneh
bonds, &c., found in his lordship's secretaire, amnd claimed by his heir,
from that injured woman.,

rayed with unusual care and
splendour, and without thiuking
it necessary to say a word to any
member of his family regarding
the occurrences of the previous
night, or asking for their com-
any in his walk, he sallied forth
at an early hour, and was pre-
sently seen making inquiries at
the door of the Elephant Hotel.
In consequence of the fies the
house was full of company, the
tables in the street were already
surrounded by persons smoking
and drinking the national smll-
beer, the publie rooms were in a
cloud of smoke, and Mr. Jos
having, in his pompous way, and
with his clumsy German, made
inquiries for the person of whom he was in search, was directed to the
very top of the house, above the first-floor rooms where some travelling
pedlars had lived, and were exhibiting their jewellery and brocades; above
the second-floor apartments occupied by the etat maor of the gambling
firm; above the third-floor rooms, tenanted by the band of renowned
Bohemian vaulters and tumblers; and so on to the little cabins of the roof,
where, among stndents, basg-men, small tradesmen, and country-folks,
come in for the festival, Becky had found a little nest;-as dirty a little
refuge as ever beauty lay hid in.
Becky liked the life 8he was at home with eerybody in the place,
pedlars, punters, tumblers, students and all. She was of a wild, roving
nature, inherited from father and mother, who were both Bohemians, by
taste and circumstance: if a Lord was not by, she would talk to his
courier with the greatest pleasure: the din, the stir, the drink, the smoke,
the tattle of the Hebrew pedlars, the solemn, braggart ways of the poor

sagger of the students, and the general buzz and hum of the place had

she had not wherewithal to pay her bill. How pleasant was all the bustle
to her now that her purse was full of the money, which little Georgy had
won for her the night beforel

coat, exceeding smart and dirty too, was actually on his knees at No. 92,
bawling through the keyhole supplications to the person within.
:Go away,'' said a well-known voiee, which made Jos thrill, ` I expect
somebody ; I expeet my grndpapa. Ha must'nt see you there.''
`Angel Englinderinn l'' bellowed the kneeling student with the whitey-
brown ringlets and the large finger-ring, `` do take compassion upon us.

We will have roast pheasants and porter, plum-pudding and French wine.

That we will,'' said the young nobleman on the bed-and this colloquy
Jos orerheard, though he did not comprehend it for the reason that he had
never studied the language in which it was carried on.

manner, when he was able to speak.
' Quater fang tooece t'' aaid the student, starting up, and he bounced into

with his eomrade on the bed.

when the door of the 92 opened of itself, and Beeky's little head
peeped out full of archness and mischief. Shelighted on Jos. `It's you,''
she said, coming out. `' How I hae been waiting for youl Stopl not
yet-in one minute you shall come in,'' In that instant she put a rouge-
pot, a brandy bottle, and a plate of broken meat into the bed, guve one
smooth to her hair, and finally let in her visitor.
She had, by way of morning robe, as pink domino, a trifle faded and
soiled, and marked here and there with pomatum; but her arms shone
ont from the loose sleeves of the dress very white and fair, and it was
tied round her little waist, so as not ill to set off the trim little figure of
the wearer. She led Jos by the hand into her garret. `'Come in,'' she
aid. ``Come, and talk to me. Sit yonder on the ohair;'' and she gave the
civilian's hand a little squeee, and laughingly placed him upon it. As
for herself, she placed herself on the bed-not on the bottle and plate,
you may be sure-on which Jos might have reposel, had he chosen that
seat; and so there she sate and talked with her old admirer.
e How little years have changed you,'' she said, with a look of tender
interest. I should have known you anywhere; what a comfort it is
amongst strangers to see once more the frank honest fuce of nn old friend]''
The frank honest face, to tell the truth, at this moment bore any
expression but one of openness and honesty: it was, on the contrary, much
perturbed and puzzled in look. Jos was surveying the queer little apart-
ment in which he found his old flame. One of her gowns hung over
the bed, another depending from a hook of the door: her bonnet
obscured half the looking-glass, on which, too, lay the prettiest little pair
of bronze boots; a Freneh novel was on the table by the bel side, with a
candle, not of wax. Becky had thcaght of popping that into he bed too,
but she only put in the little pasper night-cap, with which she had put the
candle out on going to sleep.
 I should have known you anywhere,'' she continued ; `'` a woman never
forgets some things. And you were the first man I eer-I ever saw,''

Was I, reallyt'' said Jos. `Gol bless my soul, you-you don't say so.''
eWhen I came with your sister from Chiswick, I was scarcely more than
a child,'' Becky said.  How is that der loveP Oh, her husband was
a sad wicked man, and of course, it was of me that the poor dear was
jealous. s if I cared about him, heigho: when there was somebody-
but no-don't let us talk of old times;'' and she passed her handkerchief
with the tattered lace across her eyelids.
 Is not this a strange place,'' she continued, ``for a woman, who has
lived in a very different world too, to be found inP I have had so many
griefs and wrongs, Joseph Sedley, I have been made to suffer so cruelly,
that I am almost made mad sometimes. I can't stay still in any place,
but wander about always restless and unhappy. All my friends hae

world. 1 was the truest wife that evrer lived, though I married my
husband out of pique, because somebody else-but never mind that. I
was true, and he trampled upon me, and deserted me. I ws the fondestl
mother. I had but one child, one darling, one hope, one joy, whieh I
held to my heart with a mother's affection, which was my life, my prayer,
my-my blessing ; and they-they tore it from me-tore it from me;''
and she put her hand to her heart with a passionate gesture of despair,
burying her face for a moment on the bed.
The brandy-bottle inside clinked up against the plate which held the
cold aausage. Both were moved, no doubt, by the exhibitio of so much
grief. MIax and Frit were at the door listening with wonder t
Mrs. Becky's sobs and cries. Jos, too, was a good deal frightened and
afected at seeing his old flame in this econdition. And she began, forth-
with, to tell her story-a tale so neat, simple, and artless, that it was
quite evident from hearing her, that if eer there was a white-robed
angel escaped from heaven to be subject to the infernal machinations and
villany of fiends here below, that spotless being-that miserable unsul-
lied martyr, was preeent on the bed before Jos-on the bed, sitting on the
brandy-bottle.
They had a very long, amicable, and confidential talk there ; in the course
of which, Jos Sedley was somehow made aware (but in a manner that did
not in thc least ascare or offend him) that Becky's heart had first learned
to beat at his enchanting presence: that George Oaborne had certainly
paid an unjustifiable court to er, which might aecount for Amelia's
jealousy, and their little rupture; but that Becky never gare the least
encouragement to the unfortunate oficer, and that she had neer ceased
to think about Jos from the very first day she had seen him, though, of
ceourse, her duties as a married woman were paramount-duties which
she had always preserved, and would, to her dying day, or until the
proverbially bad climate in which Colonel Crawley was living, should
relcnse her from a yoke which his cruelty had rendered odious to her.
Jos went away, convinccd that she was the moet virtous, as she was
one of the most fascinating of women, and revolving in is mind all sorts
of benevolent schemes for her welfare. Her persecutions ought to be
ended: she ought to return to the eociety of which she was an ornament.
He would see what ought to be done. She must quit that plaee, and

take a quiet lodging. Amelia must come and see her, and befriend her.
He would go and settle ashout it, and consult with the Major. She wept
tears of heartfelt gratitude as she parted from him, and pressed his hand
as the gallant stout gentleman stooped down to kiss her's.,
So Becky bowed Jos out of her little garret with as much grace as if it
was a palace of which she did the honours; and that heavy gentleman
having disappeared down the stairs, Hans and Fritz came out of their hole,
pipe in mouth, and she amused herself by mimicking Jos to them as she
munched her oold bread and sausage and took draughts of her favronrite
brandy-and-water.
Jos walked over to Dobbin's lodgings with great solemnity, and there
imparted to him the affecting history with which he had just been nade
aecquainted, without, however, mentioning the play-business of the night
before. And the two gentlemen were laying their hesds together, and
consulting as to the best means of being useful to Mrs. Becky, while she
was liuishing her interrupted dieiner a la /ourelette.
How was it that she had come to that little town How was it that
she had no friends and was wandering about alonef Little boys at
school are taught in their earliest Latin book, that the path of Avernus is
very casy of descent. Let us skip over the interval in the history of
her downward progress. She wns not worse now than she hnd been in
the days of her prosperity, only a little down on her luck.
As for Mrs. Amelia, she was a womnn of suoh a soft and foolish
disposition, that when she heard of anybody unhappy, her heart straight-
wny melted towards the sufferer; and ns she had never thought or done
anything mortally guilty herself, she had not tht abhorrence for wicked-
ness which distinguishes moralists much more knowing. If she spoiled
everyboly who came near hcr with kindness nnd compliments,-if she
begged pardon of all her servants for troubling them to answer the bell,-
if shc apologised to a shop-boy who showed her a piece of silk, or made
a curtsey to a street-sweeper, with a complimentary remark upon the
clegnt state of his crossing-and she was almost cnpable of every one of
thes follies-the notion that an old acqunintance was miserable was sure
to soften her heart; nor would she hear of anybody's being deservedly
unhappy. A world under such legislation as her's, would not be a very
orderly place of nbode; but there are not many women, nt least not of
the rulers, who are of her sort. This lady, I believe, would have abolished
all ygaols, puuishments, handcuffs, whippings, poverty, siekness, hunger,
in the world; and was such a mcan-spirited creature, that-we are obliged
to confess it-she could even forget a mortal injury.
When the Major heard from Jos of the sentimental adventure which had
just befallen the latter, he was not, it must be confessed, nearly ns much
interested as the gentleman from Bengal. On the contrary, his excitement
was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one; hoe made use of a brief but
improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress, saying, in fact,
-` th little minx, has she come to light again '' He never had had the
slightest liking for her, but, on the contrary, had heartily mistrusted her
from the very first moment when her green eyes had looked nt, ad turned
nway from, his own.

disrespectfully.  WWho knows what sort of life she has been leading; and

emember the confounded blackleg, and the way in which he used to cheat
and hoodwink poor George. Was'nt there a scandal about their sepasra-
tion? I think I heard something,'' cried out Major Dobbin, who did not
care much about gossip; and whom Jos tried in vain to convince that
Mrs. Becky was in all respects a most injured and virtuouns female.
 Well, well: let 's ask Mrs. George,'' said that arch-diplomatist of a
Major. " Only let us go and consult er. I suppose you will allow that
le is a good judge at anyrate, and knows what is right in such matters.''
Hml Emmy is very well,'' said Jos, who did not happen to be in
love with his sister.
every wellf by Gnd, Sir, she's the finest lady I eer met in my life,''
hounced out the Major. ``I say at once, lct us go and ask her if this
woman ought to be visited or not-I will be content with her verdiet.''
Now this odious, artful rogue of a Mjor was thinking in his own
mind that he was sure of his casc. FEmmy, he remembered, was at one
time cruelly and deservedly jealous of Rebecca, never mentioned her name
but with a shrinking and terror-a jealous woman never forgives, thought
Dobbin: and so the pair went across the street to Mrs. George's house, where
she was contentedly warbling at a music-lesson with Madame Strumpf.
When that lady took er leave, Jos openel the business with his
usual pomp of words. ` Amelia, my lear,'' said he, `I hnve just had the
most extraordinary-yes-God bless my soull the most cxtraordinary
adventure-an old friend-yes, n most interesting old friend of yours, and I
may asay in old times, has just arrived here, and I should like you to see her.''
Her.'' said Amelia, ` who is it Msjor Dobbin, if you please not
to break my scissars.'' The Mnjor was twirling them round by the little
ehnin from which they sometimes hung to their lady's waist, and was
thereby endangering his own eye.
eeIt is a woman whom I dislike ery much,'' said the Msjor, doggedl;
"and whom you have no cause to love.''
It is Rebecca, I 'm sure it is Rebecca,'' Amelia said blushing, and being
very much agitated.
e You nre right; you always are,'' Dobbin answered. Brssels, Waterloo,
all, old times, griefs, pangs, remembrances, rushed buack into Amelia's
gentle heart, and caused a cruel agitation there.
eDon't let me see her,'' Emmy continued. tI couldn't see her.''
I told you so,'' Dobbin said to Jos.
She is very unhappy, and-and that sort of thing,'' Jos urgel. ' She
is very poor and unprotected: and has been ill-exceedingly ill-and that
seoundrel of a husband has deserted her,''
Ah I'' said Amelia.
She hasn't a friend in the world,'' Jos went on, not undexteroul;
"and she said she thought she might trust in you. She's so miserable,

This did not seem to affect Emmy. She even smiled s little. Pen-
haps sle figured Jos to hlerself panting up the stair.
 She's beside herself with grief,'' he resumed. eThe agonies that
woman has endured are quite frightful to hear of. She hal a little boy,
of the same ge as Georgy,''
 Yes, yes, I think I remember,'' Emmy remarked. Wel2
 The most bcnutiful child ever seen,'' Jos snid, who was very fat, anl
easily moved, and hd been touched by the story Beeky told ; ``a perfeet

arms, and have never allowed him to see her,''
`Dear Joseph,'' Lmmy criel out, starting up at once, ``let us go an
see her this minute.'' And she ran iuto her adjoining bed-chamber, tiod
on her bonnet in a flutter, came out with her shawl on her arm, and
ordered Dobbin to follow.
He went and put her shawl-it was a white Cashmere, consigned to
the Major himself from India-over her shoulders. IIe saw there was
nothing for it but to obcy; and she put her hand into his arm, and they
went away.
It is numbcr 92, up four pair of stairs,'' Jos said, perhps not very
willing to ascenl the steps again; but he plaeed himself in the window of
his drawing-room, whicl commands the place on which the Llephant
stands, and saw the pair marching through the market.
It was as well that Becky saw them too from ler garret; for she
and the two studcnts were chattering and laughing there; they had been
joking about the appearance of Becky's granlpapa-whose arrival and
departure they had witnessed-but she had time to dismiss them, and
have her little room clear before the landlord of the Elephant, who kne
that Mrs. Osborne was a great favourite at the Serene Court, and respectel
her aceordingly, led the way up the stsirs to the roof-story, eneouraging
Mili and the IIerr Mujor as they achieved the ascent.

oor; he had cullel her Madae the day before, and was by no means
courteous to her.

seream. There stood kEmmy in a tremble, and Dobbin, the tall Msjor,
with his cane.
He stood still watching, and very mucl interested at the scene ; but
Emmy sprang forwvurd with open arms towards Rebccca, and forgave her
at that momecnt, and embraced her nnd kissed her with all her heart.

Amelia's were likely to touch
een such a hardened littie
reprobate as Beeky. She re-
turned Emmy's cearesses and
kind speeches with something
very like gratitude, and an emo-
tion that, if it was not lasting,
for a moment was almost
genuine. That was a lucky
stoke of her's about the child
'' torn from her arms shriek-
ing.'' It was by that harrow-
ing misfortune that Becky had
won her friend back, and it
was one of the very first points,
we may be certain, upon which
our poor aimple little Emmy
began to tak to her new found
acquaintance.
`' And so they took our
darling child from you,'' our
simpleton cried out. ``Oh,
Rebecca, my poor dear suffer-
ing friend, I know what it is
to lose a boy, and to fecl for
those who have lost one. But please Heaven your's will be restored to
yo, as a merciful, merciful Providence has brought me back mine.''
 The child, my child Oh, yes, my agonies were frightful,'' Becky
owned, not perhaps without a twinge of conscience. It jarred upon her,
to be obliged to commence instantly to tell lies in reply to so much conf-
dence and simplicity. But that is the misfortune of beginning with this
kind of forgery. When one fib becomes due as it wer, you must forge
nnother to take up the old aceeptance, and so the stock of your lies in
cireulation inevitably multiplies, and the danger of letection increases
every dy.

gave me up, and-and I recovered, and-and here I am poor and

:How old is he2'' Emmy asked.
Eleven,'' said Becky.
` Eleven l'' cried the other. Wh, he was born the same year with
Georgy, who is-''
I know, I know,'' Becky cried out, who had in fact quite forgotten all
about little Rawdon's age.  Grief has made me forget so many things,
dearest Amelia. I am very much changed: half wild sometimes. He
was eleven when they took him away from me. Bless his sweet face; I
have neer seen it again.''
 Was he fair or darkP'' went on that absurd little Emmy. `` Show me
his hair,'
Becky almost luughed at her simplicity.  Not to-day, love,-some
other time, when my trunks arrive from Leipzic, whence I came to this
place,-and a little drawing of him, which I made in happy days.''
 Poor Becky, poor BeckyI'' ssid Emy. `: How thankful, how
thankful I ought to be1'' (though I doubt whether that practice of piety
inculcated upon us by our womankind in early youth, namely to be
thankful because we are better off than somebody else, be a very rational
religious exercise;) and then she began to think as usuul, how her son
was the handsomest, the best, and the cleverest boy in the whole world.
 Iou will see my Georgy,'' was the best thing Emmy could think of
to console Beeky. If anything could make her comfortable that would.
And so the two women continued talking for an hour or more, during
which Becky had the opportunity of giving her new friend a full and com-
plete version of her private history. She showed how her marriage with
Rawdon Crawley had always been viewed by the family witl feelings of
the utmost hostility; how her sister-in-law (n artful woman) had poisoned
her husband's mind against her; how he had formed odious connexions,
which had estranged his affections from her; how she hnd borne every-
thing-poverty, neglect, coldness from the being whom she most lovel--
nnd all for the sake of her child; how, finally, and by the most flagrant
outrage, she had been drien into demanding a separation from her
husband, when the wretcl did not scruple to ask that she should saerifice
her own fair fame so that he might procure advancement through the
means of a very great and powerful but unprincipled man--the Marquis
of Steyne, indeed. The atrocious monster]
This part of her ewentfnl history Becky gsve with the utmost feminine
delicncy, and the most indignnt virtue. Forced to fly her husband's roof
by this insult, the coward had pursued his revenge, by taking her child
from her. And thus Becky said she wss a wanderer, poor, unprotected,
friendless, and wretched.
Emmy reeeivel this story, which was told at some length, as those
persons who are acquainted with her character may imagine that she
wonld. She quivered with indignation at the aecount of the conduct of
thce miserable kawdon and the unprincipled Steyne. Her eyes made notes
of admiration for every one of the sentences in which Beeky desceribed the

persecutions of her aristocratic relatises, and the falling away of her
husband. (Becky did not abuse im. Bhe spoke rather in sorrow than
in anger. She had love him only too fondly: and was he not the father
of her boy f) And as for the separationu-scene fromn the child, while Becky
was reciting it, llmmy retired altogether behind her pocket handkcrchief,
so that the consummate little tragedian must hnve been charmed to see
the elfect which her performance produced on her audience.
Whilat the ladies were carrying on their conversation, Amelia's constant
escort, the Major, who, of course, did not wish to interrupt their
conference, and finding himself rather tired of cresking about the narrow
stair passage of which the roof brushed the nap from his hat, descended
to the ground-floor of the house and into the great room common to all the
frequeuters of tle kElephant, out of which the stair led. This apartment
is always in a fume of smoke, and liberally sprinkled with beer. On a
dirty tnble stand scores of corresponding brass-candlesticks with tallow
candles for the lodgers, whose keys hang up in rows over the candles.
Emmy had passed blushing through the room anon, where all sorts of
people were collected ; Tyrolese glove-sellers and Danubian linen-merchants,
with their packs; students recruiting themselves with butterbrods and
meat ; idlers, playing cards or dominoes on the sloppy, beery tables;
tumblers refreshing during the cessation of their performances ;-in a word,
all the fimum and strepitus of an German inn in fair time. The waiter
brought the Major a mug of beer, as a matter of course; and he took out
a cigar, and namused himself with that pernicious vegetable and a news-
paper until his charge should come down to claim him,
Max and ritz came presently down stairs, their caps on one side, their
spursjingling, their pipes splendid with coats-of-arms and full-blown tassels;
nnd they hung up the key of No. 90 on the bonrd, and called for the
ration of butterlrod and beer. The pair sate down by the Masjor, and fell
into a conversation of which he could not help hearing somewhat. It was
mainly about '` Fuehs'' and `Philister,'' and duels and drinking-bouts at
thie neighbouring University of Schoppenhausen, from which renowned
aeat of learniug they had just eome in the Eilwagen, with Becky, as it
appeared, by their side, and in order to be present at the bridal fetes at
lumpernickel.
The little Englinderinn seems to be en lays de gonnoissanee,'' said
Max, who knew the French language, to Fritz, his comrade.  After the
fat grandfather went away, there came n pretty little compatriot. I henrd
them chattering anl whimpering together in the little woman's chamber.''
WWe must take the tickets for her concert,'' Rritz said.  Hast thou
any money, Max P '
`Bah,'' said the other, `" the concert is a concert in nuibas. Hans said
that she advertised one at Leipzic: and the Burschen took many tickets.
But she went off without singing. She said in the coach yesterday that
her pianist had fallen ill at Dresden. She cannot sing, it is my belief : her
voice is as cracked as thine, O thou beer-soaking Renownerl''
`It is cracked; I heard her trying out of her window a schrecklich

sively having buried their blond whiskers in the mawkish draught, curled
them and swaggered off into the fair.
The Major, who had seen the key of number 90 put up on ts hook,
and had heard the conversation of the two young university bioods, was
not at a loss to understand that their talk related to Becky.  Tha
little deril is at her old tricks,'' he thought, and he smiled as he recalled
old dasys, when he hadl witnessed the desperate flirtation with Jos,
and the ludicrous enl of that alventure. He and George had often
laughed over it subsequeutly, and until a few weeks after George'a
marriage, when he also was caught in the little Circe's toils, and had
an understanding with her which his comrade certainly suspected, but
preferred to ignore. William was too much hurt or ashamed to ask
to fathom that disgraceful mystery, although onee, and evidently with
remorse on his mind, George had alluded to it. It was on the morning
of Waterloo as the youug men stool together in front of their line,
survreying the black masses of Frenchmen who crowned the opposite

intrigue with a woman,'' George said. 'I am glad we were marched away.

Gol it had never been begunI'' And William, was pleasel to think,
and had more than once soothed poor George's widow with the nsr-
rative, that Osborne, after quitting his wife, and after the action of
uatre Bras, on the first day, spoke gravely und affeetionately to his com-
rade of his father and his wife. On these facts, too, William had insisted
very strongly in his conversations with the elder Osborne: and had thus
been the means of reeonciling the old gentleman to his son's memory, just
at the close of the elder man's life.
``And so thia devil is still going on with her intrigues,'' thought William.
I wish he were a hundred miles from here. She brings misehief
wherever she goes,'' And he was pursuing these forebodings and this
uncomfortable train of thought, with his hend between his hands, and
the `` Pumpernickel Gazette'' of lnst week unread under his nose, when
somebody tapped his shoulder with a parssol, and he looked up and ssw
Mrs. Amelia.
This woman had a way of tyrannising over Major Dobhin (for the
weakest of all people will domineer over somebody), and she ordered him
about, and patted him, and made him fetch and carry just as if he wasa
great Newfoundland dog. He liked, so to speak, to jump into the water
if she sai `` High, Dobbinl'' and to trot behind her with her reticule in
his mouth. This history has been written to ery little purpose if the
realer has not perceived thnt the MIajor was a spooney.
 WVhy did you not wait for me, Sir, to escort me downstairsf'' she said,
giving a little toss of her head, and a most sarcastice curtsey.
I coulln't stand up in the passage,'' he answered, with n comical depre-
catory look; and, delighted to give her his arm, and to take her out of the
horrid smoky place, he would have walked off without even so much as
remembering the waiter, hud not the young fellow run after him and
stopped him on the threshold of the Elephant to make him pay for the
beer wlich he hal not consumed. Emmy laughed: she called him a
naughty man, who wanted to run away in debt; and, in fact, made some
jokes suitable to the oceasion and the small-beer. She was in high spirits
and good humour, and tripped across the market-place very briskly. She
wanted to see Jos that instant. The Msjor laughed at the impetuons
affection Mrs. Amelia exhibited; for, in truth, it was not very often thalt
he wanted her brother ``that instant,''
They found the Civilian in his saloon on the first foor; he had been
pacing the room, and biting his nails, and looking over the market-plaee
towards the Elephant a hundred times at least during the past hour, whilst
Emmy was closeted with her friend in the garret, and the Mnjor was beating
the tattoo on the sloppy tables of the public room below, and he was, on
his side too, very anxious to see Mrs. Osborne.
 Well2'' said he.

and, after having fired this shot, she walked out of the room with a
most majestic air, and shut her own door briskly on herself and her
outraged dignity.

hung there as usual, with the portrait of the boy underneath. 'It wass

it is from his own lips that I know how wicked and groundless my jealousy
was; and that you were pure,-Oh yes, you were pure, my saint in

She paced the room trembling and indignant. She went and leaned
on the chest of drawers over which the picture hung, and gazed and gazed
at it. Its eyes seemed to look down on her with a reproach that deepened
as she looked. The early dear, dear memories of thnt brief prime of love
rushed back upon her. The wound which years had scarcely cicatrised

William, though he sas by Amelia's looks that a great crisis had
come, nesertheless continued to implore Sedley, in the most energetic
terms, to beware of Rebecca: and he eagerly, almost frantically, abjured
Jos not to receive her. IIe besought Mr, bSedley to inquire at least
regarding her: told lim how he had heard that she was in the eompany of
gamblers and people of ill repute: pointed out what evil she had done in
former days: how she and Crawley had misled poor George into ruin:
how she was now parted from her husband, by her own conlession, and,
perhaps, for good reason. What a dangerous companion she would be for
his sister, who knew notling of the affuirs of the world1 William implored
Jos, with all the eloquence which he could bring to bear, and a great deal
more energy than this quiet gentleman was ordinarily in the habit of
showing, to keep Rebecca out of his household.
Had he been less violent, or more dexterous, he might have succeeded in
lis supplications to Jos; ut the Civilian was not a little jealous of the
airs of superiority which the Masjor constantly exhibited towards him, as
he fancied (indeed, he had imparted his opiuions to Mr. kirsch, the
courier, whose bills Mnjor Dobbin cheeked on this jonrney, and who sided
with his master), and he began a blustering speech about his competency
to defend his own honour, his desire not to have his affuirs meddled with,
his intention, in fine, to rebel against the Mnjor, when the colloquy--
rather along and stormy one-was put an end to in the simplest way pos-
sible, namely, by the urrival of Mrs. Becky, with a porter. from the
Elephant Hotel, in chnrge of her very meagre baggage.
She greeted her host with affectionate respect, and mnde a shrinking,
but amicnble, salutation to Major Dobbin, who, as her instinct assured her
at once, was her cney, and hnd been speaking against her; and the
bustle and clatter consequent upon her arrival brought Amelia out of her
room, who went up and embracel her guest with the greatest warmth, and
took no notice of the Mnjor, except to fling him an angry look-the most
unjust and scornful glance that had perhaps ever appeared in that poor
little woman's face since she was born. But she had priate reasons
of her own, and ws bent upon bcing angry with him. Anl Dobbin,
indignant at the injustice, not at the defeat, went off, making her a bow
quite as hauglty as the killing curtsey with which the little woman chose
to bid him farewell.
He being gone, ELmmy was particularly lively and affectionate to
Rebecca, and bustlel about the npartments and installed her guest in her
room with an eagerness and activity seldom exhibited by our placid little
friend. But when an act of injustice is to be done, especially by weak
people, it is best that it should be done quickly ; and Emy thought she
was displaying a great deal of firness and proper feeling and veneration
for the late Captain Osborne in her present behaviour.

asked, with his nsual simplicity of language. : Major Dobbin is dining
out, I suppose,'' his mother said; and, drawing the boy to her, kissed him
a great deal, and put his hair off his forehead, and introduced him to Mrs.
Crawley.  This is my boy, Rebecea,'' Mrs. Osborne sid-as much as
to say-can the world produce anything like that Becky looked at him
with rapture, and pressed his hand fondly. ` Dear boy!'' she said-
``he is just like my-'' Emotion choked her further utteranee; but
Amelia understood, as well as if she had spoken, that Becky was thinking
of her own blessed child. Howeer, the company of ler friend consoled
Mrs. Crawley, and she ate a very good dinner.
During the repast, she had occasion to speak several times, when
Georgy eyed her and listened to her. At the dessert Emmy was gone out
to superintend further domestic arrangements: Jos was in his great chair
dozing over Galignani: Georgy and the new arrial sat close to esch
other : he had continued to look at her knowingly more than onee, and
nt last he laid down the nut-craekers.
I sasy,'' said Georgy.
e What do you sayt'' ecky suid, laughing.
You 're the lady I saw in the mask at the Rouge et Noir,''
 Hush 1 you little sly ereature,'' Becky said, taking up his hand and
kissing it. `" Your uncle was there too, and mamma mustn't know,''
Oh no-not by no means,'' answered the little fellow,
 Yon see we are quite good friends already,'' Beeky ssid to Emmy, who
now re-entered; and it must be owned that Mrs. Osborne had introduced
n most judicious and amiable companion into her house.
William, in a state of great indignation, though still unaware of all
the treason that was in store for him, walked about the town wildly until
he fell upon the Secretary of Legstion, Tapeworm, who invited him to
dinner. As they were discussing that meal, he took occasion to ask the
Seeretary whether he knew anything about a certain Mrs, Rawdon Crawley,
who had, he believed, made some uoise in London; and then Tapeworm,
who of course knew all the London gossip, and was besides a relative of
ILady Gaunt, poured out into theastonished Major's ears sucha history about
Becky and her husband as astonisled the querist, and supplied all the
points of this narratie, for it was at that very table years ago that the
present writer had the pleasure of hearing the tale. Tufto, Steyne, the
Crawleys, and their history-everything connected with Becky and her
previous life passed under the record of the bitter diplomatist. He kne
everything and a great deal besides, about all the world;-in a word, he
made the most astounding revelations to the simple-hearted Major. When
Dobbin said that Mrs. Osborne and Mr. Sedley had taken her into their
house, he burst into a peal of laughter which shocked the Masjor, and
asked if they lal not better send into the prison, and take in one or twa
of the gentlemen in shaved heads and yellow jsekets, who aswept the
streets of Pumpernickel, chained in pairs, to boardl and lodge, and aet
as tutor to that little scapegrace Georgy.
This information astoished and horrified the MIaijor not a little. It had

been agreed in the morning (before meeting with Rebeces) that Amelis
hould go to the Court ball that night. There wonld be the plaee to tell
her. The Major went home and dressed himself in his uniform, and
repaired to Court, in hopes to see Mrs. Osborne. She neer came. When
he returned to his lodgings all the lights in the Sedley tenement were put
out. He could not see her till the morning. I don't know what sort of
a night's rest he had with this frightful secret in bed with him.
At the earliest convenient hour in the morning he sent his servant
across the way with a note, saying, that he wished very particularly to
speak with her. A message came back to sy, that Mrs. Osborne was
exceedingly unwell, and was keeping her room.
She, too, had been awake all that night. She had been thinking of a
thing which had agitated her mind a hundred times before. A handred
times on the point of yielding, she had shrunk back from a sacrifiee
which she felt was too much for her. She couldn't, in spite of his loe
and constancy, and her own acknowledged regard, respect, and gratitude.
What are benefits, what is conslanay, or meritP One curl of a girl's
ringlet, one hair of a whisker, will turn the scale against them all ins
minute. They did not weigh with Emmy more than with other women.
She hal tried them; wanted to make them pass; could not; and the
pitiless little woman had found a pretext, and determined to be free.
When at length, in the afernoon, the Msjor gained admission to Amelia,
insteal of the cordial and affectionate greeting to which he had been
accustomed now for many a long day, he received the salutation ofa
curtsey, and of a little gloved hand, retracted the moment afler it was
accorded to him.
Rebecca, too, was in the room, and advanced to meet him with a smile
and an extende hand. Dobbin drew back rather confusedly. `` I-I beg
your pardon, Ma'am,'' he said; `' but I am bound to tell you that it is not
as your friend that lI am come here now,''
iPoohl damn; don't let us have this sort of thingl'' Jos cried out,
alarmed, and anxious to get rid of a scene.
`I wonder what Major Dobbin has to say against Rebeecea?'' Ameli
suaid in n low, clear voice with a slight quiver in it, and a very determined
look uabout the eyes.
I will not have this sort of thiug in my house,'' Jos again interposed.
:I say I will not have it : asnd Dobbin, I beg, Sir, you 'll astop it.'' And
he lookd round trembling and turning very red, and gae a great puff,
and mnde for his door.
` Dear friendl'' Rcbcecas said with angelie sweetness, `` do hear whast
Major Dobbin has to say against me.''
:I will not hear it, I say,'' squeakd out Jos at the top of his voice,
and, gathering up his dressing-gown, wns gone.
`We are only two women,'' Amelia said. ` ou can speak now, Sir.''
 This munner towards me is one which searcely becomes you, Amelia,''
the Major answered hnughtily; '`nor I believe am I guilty of habitual
harshess to women. It is not a pleasure to me to do the duty which Il
am come to do,''

Amelia, who was more and more in a pet, The expression of Dobbin's face,
as she spoke in this imperious manner, was not pleasant.
I cnme to say-and as you stay, Mrs. Craley, I must suy it in your
presencee-that I think you-you ought not to form a member of the
family of my friends. A lady who is separated from her husband, wha

-is not a fit companion for Mrs. Osborne and her son,'' Dobbin went
on : ``and I may add that there are people here who know you, and who
profess to know that regarding your conduct about which I don't even
wish to speak before-before Mrs. Osborne.''
eYonr's is a very modest and convenient sort of calumny, Major
Dobbin,'' Rebecca said. :Tou leave me uuler the weight of an accusa-
tion which, after all, is unsaid. What is itP Is it unfaithfulness to my
husband? I scorn it, and defy anybody to prove it-I defy you, I say.

meP Yes, lI am guilty of those faults, and punished for them every dasy.
Let me go, Emmy. It is only to suppose that I have not met you, and I
am no worse to-day than IL was yesterday. It is only to suppose that the
night is oer and the poor wanderer is on her way. Don't you remember
the song we used to sing in old, dear old days? I have been wandering
eer since then-a poor castaway, scormned for being miscrable, and insulted
because I am alone. Let me go: my astsy here interferes with the plans
of this gentleman.''
Indeed it does, Madam,'' said the Major.  If I hae any authority
in this house--''
'Authority, nonel'' broke out Amelia.  Rebeeca, you stay with me.
I won't desert you, becuse you have been persecuted, or insult you,
because-becanse Major Dobbin chooses to do so. Come away, dear.''
And the two women made towards their door.
William opened it. As they were going out, however, he took Amelia's
hand, and sail--e Will you stay a moment and speak to me''
 He wishces to speak to you away from me,'' said Becky, looking like
a martyr. Amelia griped her hand in reply.
"Upon my honour it is not about you that I am going to speak,''

Mrs. Crawley, as ho shut the door upon her. Amelia looked at hin,

vYou don't mean that, Amelia2'' illiam said, sasdly. ``Tou don't
mean that these words, uttered in a hurried moment, are to weigh against
a whole life's devotion. I think that George's memory has not been
injured by the way in which I hae dealt with it, and if we are come to
bandying reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the mother
of his son. Reflect, afterwards when-when you ure at leisure, and your
conscienee will withdraw this aecusation. It does even now,'' Amelia
held down her head.
It is not that speech of yesterday,'' he ocontinued, ``' which moves you.
That is but the pretext, Amelia, or I have loved you and watched you far
fifteen years in vain. Have l not learned in that time to read all your
feelings, and look into your thoughtsP I know what your heart is
capable of: it can cling faithfully to a recollection, and cherish a faney;
but it can't feel such an attachment as mine deserves to mate with, andl
such as I would hae won from a woman more generous than yon.
No, you are not worthy of the love which I hae devoted to you. I knew
all along that the prize I had set my life on was not worth the winning;
that I wus a fool, with fond fancies, too, bartering away my all of truth
and ardour ngainst your little feeble remnant of love. I will bargain no
more : I withdraw. I find no fault with you. You are very good-
natured, and have done your best; but you couldn't-you couldn't reach
up to the height of the attachment which I bore you, and which as loftier
soul than yours might have been proud to share. Good bye, AmeliaI I
have watched your struggle. Let it end. We are both weary of it.''
Amelia stood scared and silent as William thus suidenly broke the
chain by which she held him, and declared his independence and supe-
riority. He had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little
woman had been aceustomed to trample upon him. She didn't wish to
marry him, but she wished to keep him. She wished to give him nothing,
but that he should gie her all. It is a bargain not unfrequently leied
in love.
William's sally had quite broken and cast her down. Her assault ws
long since over and beaten back.
"Am I to understand then,-that you are going-away,-William 2''
she said.
He gave a sad laugh. `I went onee before,'' he ssid, `' and came back
after twelve yenrs. We were young then, Amelia. Good-bye. I hae
spent enough of my life at this play.''
Whilt they had been talking, the door into Mrs. Osborne's room had
opened eer so little; indeed, Becky had kept a hold of the handle
and hal turned it on the instant when Dobbin quitted it; and she heard
every word of the conersation that had passed between these two,  What

The parting was over. Once more poor Willinm walked to the door
and was gone; and the little witow, the author of all this work, had her
will, and had won her victory, and was left to enjoy it as she best might.
Let the lalies envy her triumph.
At the romantia hour of diuner Mr. Georgy made his appearnce, and
agaiu remarked te absence of  Old bDob.'' 1he meal was eatecn in ileucc
by the party; Jos's nppetite not bcing diminished, but Emmy takiug
nothing at all.
Mfter the meal, Georgy was lolling in the cushions of the oll window,

commanding on one side the Market Plnce, where tle Elcphant is, and in
frnt the opposite side of ` Goswell Street over the way,'' like the immortal

MIajor had bought for six pounds sterling, and about which they used to

William had got into the carriage, releasel from the embraces of hi
landlord. George bounded in afterwards and flung his arms round the
Major's neck (s they saw from the window), and began asking him
multiplied questions. Then he felt in his waistcoat-pocket and gave him
a note. William seized at it rather esgerly, he opened it trembling, but
instantly his countenance changed, and he tore the paper in two and
dropped it out of the carriage. He kissed Georgy on the lead, and the
boy got out, doubling his fists into lis eyes, and with the aid of Francis.
He lingered with his iand on the panel. Fort Schwagerl The yellow

round nubout him.
As for Emmy, who found herself not in the lcenst mistress of cr own

way to soothe and please her. She tulked to her perpetually about MIajor

subsequently, because the latter becnme William's most ardent admircr

iudulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne wns `` brushing their
'nirs,'' as she called the yellow loeks of the one, and the soft brown tressce
of the other, this girl always put in her word for that dear good gentleman
Mnjor Dobbin. Ier advocacy did not make Amelia angry any mere thnn
Rebecca's admiration of him. She mnde Gcorge write to him constnntly,
and persisted in ecnding Mnmmn's kind love in a postscript. And as shc
looked at her husbanl's portrait of nights, it no longer reproached her-
perlips she repronched it, now William was goue.
Emmy was not very happy after her heroic sncerifice. She was very
dieteraite, nervons, silent, nnd ill to please. The family had never known
her so peevish. She grew pnle and ill. She used to try and sing cer-
tain songs, ( Einsnm bin ich nicht alleine,'' wns one of them; that
tender love-song of Weber's, which, in old-fashionel dys, young ladies,
nnd when you were scarcely born, showed that those who lived before yon
knew too how to love nnd to sing);-certain songs, I sny, to which the
Major was partial; and as she wnrbled them in the twilight in the drawing-
room, she would break off in the midst of the song, nnd walk into hen
neighbouring apartment, and there, uo doubt, take refuge in the miniature
of her husbnd.
Somne books still subsisted, after Dobbin's departure, with lis name
written in them; n German bDictionary, for instance, with  William bDob-
bin, -th lcg.,'' in the fly-leaf; a guile-book with his initinls, and one or
two other volumcs which belonged to the Mnjor. lEmmy cleared these
awny, and put them on the drawers, where she placed her work-box, her
desk, her Bible, and Prayer-book, under the pictures of the two Georges.
And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind him, it is a
fnet that Georgy, rummaging his mother's desk sometime afterwards,
found the glovcs neatly folled up, and put away in what they call tho
seecret drawers of the desk.
Not caring for society, and moping there a grent deal, Emmy's chief
pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with Georgy (during
which Rebcccn wus left to the society of Mr. Joseph), nnd then the mother
nnd son used to talk about the MIajor in a way which ecn made the boy
smile. She told him thnt she thought Mnior Willinm was the best man
in anll the world ; the gentlest and the kindest, the braveet, and the humblest.
Over and over again, she toll him how they owed everything which they
possessed in the world to that kind friend's benevolcnt care of them;
how he had befrienled them all through their poverty anl misfortunes;
wateched oer them when nobody cared for them; how all his comrades
ndmired him though he never spoke of his own gllant actions; how
Georgy's father trusted him beyond all other men, and hnd been con-
stantly befriended by the good Willinm.  Why, when your Papa was
little boy,'' she said,  he often told me that it was William who defended
him against a tyrant at the school where they weroe; and their friendship
never ceasel from that lay until the lasst, when your dcar father fell,''

sure he did, or he would if he could hnve cught him; would 'nt
he, Mother When I'm in the army, won't I hate the French:-
that 's all.''
In such colloquies the mother and the child passed a great deal of their
time togcether. Tle artless woman had made a confidant of the boy. He
was as much William's friend as everybody else who knew him well.
By the wuy, Mrs. Beoky, not to be behind-hand in sentiment, hal got
n miniature too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amuscment
of most people, and the delight of the original, who was no oter than
onr friend Jos. On her first coming to favour the Sedleys with a visit,
the little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably sall shabby kit, waa
perhaps ashmed of the meanness of her trunks and band-boxes, nnd often
spoke with great respect about her baggnge left behiud at Leipzig, whieh
she must have from that city. WWhen a traveller tnlks to you perpetually
nbout the splendour of his luggage, whieh hc does not happen to have
with him; my son, beware of that truvellerl He is, teu to one, an
impostor.
Neither Jos nor Emmy knew this important maxim. It seemel to them
of no consequence whether Beeky had a quantity of very ine ciotles in
invisible trunks; but ns her present supply was exceedingly shalb,
Emmy supplied her out of her own stores, or took her to the best illiner
in the town, and there fitted her out. It was no more torn collars nos, I
promise you, and faded silks trailing off at the shoulder. Beeky chauged
her habits with hcr situation in life-the rouge-pot was suspended-
nuother excitement to which she had aecustomed herself was also put aside,
or at least only indulged in in privacy ; as when she was prevailed on by
Jos of a summer evening, ELmmy nnd the boy being absent on their walks,
to tnke a little spirit-and-water. But if she did not indulgc-the conrier
lid : that rascal Kirsch coull not be kept from tle bottle; nor could he
tell how mucl he took when he applicd to it. He was sometimcs surprised
himslf at the way in wlich Mr. Sedley's Cognac diminishel. Well, well;
this is a painful subjeet. Becky did not very likely indulge so much as
she used hefore he entered a decorous fanmily.
At last the mucl-bragged about boxes arrived from Lcipzig ;-three of
them not by any means large or splendid ;-nor did Becky appear to take
out nny sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did arrie.
But out of one, which contained a mass of her papers (it was thnt very
box whicel nwdon Crawley had ransacked iu his furious hunt for Becky's
concenled money), she took a picture with great glce, wsluich she pinued p
in her root, and to which she introduced Jos. It was the portrait of s
gentleman in pencil, his face having the adantage of being painted up in
pink. e was riding on an elephant away from sorue cocoa-nut trees, and
n pngoda: it was an lEastern scene.
God bless my soul, it is my portrait,'' Jos erici out. It sas he
indeed, blooming in youth mnd beauty, in a nankecn jncket of the cut of
1S01. It was the old piclure tht used to hag up in Russell  tc:e.

went to see if I ocould be of any use to my kind fricuds. l havc never
parted with that picture-I never will,''
Won't you?'' Jos cried, with a look of unutterable rapture and satisfac-
tion. ` Did you really now value it for y sake''
 You know I did, well enough,'' said Beeky; `` bUut why speak,-why
think,-why look buek 1t is too late now I''
That evening's conversation was lelicious, for Jos. Emmy only
came in to go to bel very tircd and unwell. Jos and his fair guest
had a charming tcte-i-tite and his sister could hear, as she lay awake
in her adjoining chamher, lcbecca singing over to Jos thc old songe
of 1815. He did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, any ore than
Amelia.
It was June, and, y consequenee, ligh season in London,; Jos, who
read the incomparable '' Galignani'' (the exile's best friceul) through every
la, used to favsour the ladies wvith extraets from his paper during their
breakfast. Every week in tlis paper there is a full account of military
movements, in which Jos, as a man who had seen service, was especially
interested. On one occasion he read out-`Arrival of the -th regiment.
-Gravesend, June 20.-The llamchunder, Fast Indimuan, came into the
river this morning, having on bonrl 14 oflicers, and 132 rank and file
of this gallant corps. They have been absent from ngland 14 years,
having been enbrked the year after Waterloo, in which glorious conflict
they took an active part, anl having subsequently distinguishel them-
sele in the Burese war. The eteran colonel, Sir Miclnel O'Dowd,
K.C.bB., with is lady and sister, lunded here yesterday, wih Captains

for the defenders of Old England. During the repast, whieh wc need not
say was servcl up in Wayte's best style, the cleering continued so
enthusiastically, tlat Lady O'Dowd and the Colonel came forwvard to the
balcony, and drank the henlths of thei fellon-countryen in a bumper of
Wnyte's best claret.''
On a seceond occuasion Jos rend a brief announccment-MIajor Dobbin hal
joiued the-th regiment at Chatham; and subsequently he prulgated
aecounts of the presentations at the Drawing-room, of Colonel Sir
Michael O'Dowl, K.C.lB., Indy O'Dowd (by Mrs. Miolloy Mlulony ol
Ballymalony), anl Miss Glorvina O'Dowd (by Lady O'DDowd). Alnost
directly after this, Dobbin's uame appeared among te Lieutenant-
Colonels : for old Marshal Tiptoff had died during the pussge of the
--th from Madrs, and the Sovereign was pleased to advnnce Colonel Sir
Michael O'Dowd to the rank of Major-General on his return to England,
with an intimation that he should be Colouel of the listinguishecd rcgiment
which he had so long commanled.

ceorrespondence between George and his guardian had not ceased by any
menus: William had cven written once or twice to her siuce his departure,
but in a manner so uneonstrainedly cold, that the poor woman felt now in her
turn that she had lost her power over him, and tlat, as he had said, he was
free. le had left her, and she was wretched. The mnemory of his almost
countless services, and lofty and affectionate regard, now presented itself
to her, nnd rebukel hcr day and night. Shc brooded over those recollee-
tions according to her wont; saw the purity and beauty of the nffection
with which sle had trifled, snd reproaehed herself for having tlung away
such a treasure.
It was gone indeed. William lad spent it all out. He lovel her no
more, he thought, as he hd loved her. He never could again. That
sort of regard, whiecl he lal proffered to her for so many faithful ycars, can't
be flung down and shattered, and mended so as to show no scars. The
litle heedless tyraent hal so destroyed it. No, William thought agsin
and agin, `` It was myself I deluded, and persisted in cjoling: iad she
been worthy of the love I gave her, she would hae returned it long ago.
It was a fond mistake. Isn't the whole course of life made up of such
and suppose I hnd won her, should I not have been disenchanted the dsy
nfter my victory Why pine, or be ashamed of my defeat?'' The more
he thought of this long passage of his life, the more clearly he saw his
deception. ``1'll go into hamness again,'' he saidl, ``and do my duty in that
state of life in which it has pleased Heaven to place me. I will eee that the
buttons of the reeruits aro properly bright, and that the serjeants make
no mistakes in their aceounts. I will dine at mess, nnd listen to the
Sootch surgeon telling his stories. When I am old and broke, I will ga

whereof Francis only heard the last two lines, paeing up and down the
Boompjes at Rotterdam. The ' Batavier'' was lyig in the basin. He
could see the place on the quarter-deck, where he and Emmy had sate on

After June nll the little Court Society of Pumpernickel used to sepa-
rate, according to the German plan, and make for a hundred watering-
plaees, where they drank at the wells; rode upon donkeys; gnmbled at the
reontes, if they had money and a mind; rushed with hundreds of their
kinl, to gormandise at the tales d '6dte , and idled away the summer. The
kEnglish diplomtists went off to oeplitz and Missingen, their Freneh rivals
shut up their clanucellerie and whisked away to their dnrling Bouleard de
Gand. The Transparent reiguing family took, too, to the waters, or retired
to their hunting-lodges. Everybody went away having any pretensions
to politeness, aud, of coursc, with them, Doctor on Glauber, the Court
Doctor, and his Bhroness. The seasons for the bnths were the most produe-

tive periods of the Doctor's practice-he uniled business with pleasure,
nnd his clief place of resort was Ostend, which is uch frequented by
Germans, and where the bDoctor treated himself nnd his spouse to what he
oalletd a `'dib'' in the sea.
His interesting patient, Jos, was a regular milch cow to the Doctor, and he
easily persunded the civilian, both for his own henltl's sake and that of his
charming sister, which was renlly very much slattered, to pass the summer
nt that hideous seaport town. kEmmy did not care where she went mucl
Georgy jupel at the idea of n move. As for l3ecky, she cnme ns a
nuatter of course in the fourth place inside of the fine barouche Mr. Jos had
lought: the two domestics being on the box in Iront. She might have
sone misgivings about the friends whom sle should meet there, and who
might bc likely to tell ugly stories-but, bahl she was strong enough to hold
her own. She had cast such an anchor in Jos now as would require n strong
storm to shke. That incident of the picture hnl finished him. Becky
took lown her elephant, and put it into the little box which she hal hud
from Amelia ever so many yenrs ago. Emmy also came off with her Lares,
-her two pictures,-and the party, finally, were lodged in an exceeedingly
dcar and uncomfortable house at Osted.
There Amelia begn to take baths, nl get what good she could from
them, and though scores of people of Becky's nequaiutance passed er aud
cut her, yet Mrs. Osborne, wlo walked about with her, and who kncw
nobody, was not aware of the treatment experienced by thc friend whom
she hnd chosen so judiciously as a companion ; inleed, Becky never thought
fit to tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes.
fSome of MIrs. Rawdon Crawley's aequaintances, however, acknowlcdgel
her readily cuough,-perhaps ore readily than she would have desired.
Among these were Mjor Loder (unattachel), and Cnptin Rook (lnte of the
Ritles), who might be seen any dny on the Dyke, smoking aud staring
nt the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable
board and select circle of Mr. Joseph Sedley. In fact, they would
take no denial; they burst into the house whether Becky was at home or
not, walkel into MIrs. Oslorne's drnwing-room, which they perfumed with
their coats nnl mustachios, clled Jos : Old buck,'' and invaded lis
dinner-table, and lnughed and drank for long hours there.
 What cn they menn'' nsked Georgy, who dil not like these gentle-
men. `I heard the Major say to Mrs. Crawley yesterday, ` No,no, lBecky,
you shan't keep the old buck to yoursell, We must have the bones in,
or, dmmy, 1 'll split.' What could the MIojor mean, MIa2''
v Majorl don't call Mim Majorl'' mmy said. I 'm sure I cnn't
tell what he mennt.'' His presenee and that of his friend inspired the
little lady with intolerable terror and aversion. Ihey paid her tipsy com-
pliments; they leered at her over the dinner-table. hnd the Captain made
her advances that filled her with sickening disay, nor would she ever see
him unless shc hnd George by her side.
Rebecca, also, to do her justice, never wonld let either of these men
remain nlone with Mmelia; the Major wns disengaged too, and swore he
would be the winner of her. A couple of ruffinns were fighting for this

innocent creature, gambling for her at her own table; and though she
was not aware of the rascals' dcsigns upon her, yet she felt a horror and
uneasincss in their presence, and longed to fly.
Sle besonght, she entrealed Jos to come home. Not he. Ie was
low of moveent, tied to his Doctor, and perhaps to some other leading-
trings. At least Bccky ws not auxsious to go to England.
At last shc took a great resolution-mnde the great plunge. She wrote
ff a lcetter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water; a
lettecr about which she did not spcak a word to anybody, which she carried
hersclf to the post under her shawl, nor was any remark made about it;
culy that she looked very much flusled and agitated when Georgy met
hcer ; and she kissed him al hung over him a great deal that night. She
lid not come out of hcr room after her return from her walk. Becky
thonught it was MInjor Loder and the Captain who frightened her.
`She mustn 't stop here,'' Becky reasoned with herself, `She must go
nway, the silly littlc fool. Sle is still whimpering after that galy ofa
husband-dead, (and sered right.) these fifteen yesrs. She shan't marry
cither of these men. It's too bad of Loder. No; ahe shall marry the
bmboo-cne, I 'll settle it tlis very night.''
So Bocky took a cup of tea to Mmelin in her prirate npartment, and
found that lady in the company of her miniatures, anl in a most nelancholy
and nervous condition. She laid dow the cup of tea.
Thank you,'' said Amelia.
 IListen to me, Mmelia,'' said ecky, marching up and down the room
beforce the othcr, and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous kindness.
I want to talkto you. You must go away from here and from the iperti-
nences of thesc men. I won't have you harassed by them; nnd they will
insult you if you stay. I tell you they are rascals; men fit to send to the

catingly, but I could 'nt forget -;'' and she finished the sentence by
looking up at tle portrait.

cary of you, nnd would have jilted you, but that Dobbin forced him ta

and taking a little paper out of her belt, she opened it and tlung it into
Emmy's lsp. ` You know his hand-writing. He wrote that toe-wanted
me to run away with him-gave it me under your nose, the day before
he was shot-and served him right.'' Beeky repeated.
Emmy did not hear her; she was looking at the letter. It was tht
which George had put into the bouquet and given to Becky on thc uight
of the Duke of kiclunond's ball. It was as she said : the toolish young
man hal nsked her to fly.
Emmy's head sank down, and for almost the last time in which she shall
be called upon to weep in this history, she commenced that work. Her
head fell to her osom, nnd her hnnds went up to her cyes; and there for
nwhile, she gave way to her emotions, as IBecky stood on nnd regardel her.
WYho shall analyse those tears, and say whether they were sweet or
bitterP Wus she most grievel, because the idol of her life was tumbled
lown and shivered ut her feet, or indignant that lcr love had been so
despised, or glad bccnuse the barrier was recmoved which modcsty had
placed between her and a new, a real affection ` There is nothing to
lorbid me now,'' she thought.  lI may love him with ull my heart now.
O, I will, I will, if he will but let me, and forgive me.'' I believe it was
this feeling rushed over all tle others whicl agitatcd that gcntle little
bosom.
Indeed, she did not cry so much as Becky expected-the other soathed
nnd kissed her-a rare mark of sympathy with Mrs. Becky. Sle treated
Emmy like a child, and patted her head. ``And now let us gct pen and
ink, afid write to him to come this minute,'' she said.
'I-I wrote to him this morning,'' Emmy snil, blushing exceelingly.
Beoky screamed with laughter-` U iglielto,'' she snng out with
Rosina, `' eccolo ua /''-the-wlole house ecloed with her slill singing.
Two ornings after this little scene, although the day was rainy and
gsty, and Amelia had had nn exceelingly wakelul night, listening to the
wind ronring, and pitying all travellers by land and by water, yct she got
p early, and insisted upon taking a walk on the Dyke with Georgy; and
there she naced as the rain beut into her face, nnd she looked out west-
ward aceross the dark sea line, and over the swollen billows which came
tumbling and frthing to tle shore. Ncitler spoke much, except now
and then, when the boy said nfew words to his timid eompanion, indicative
of sympathy and protection.
iI hope he won't cross in such weather,'' Emmy said.
:I et ten to one he does,'' the boy answered.  Look, mother,
there's the smoke of the steamer,'' It was thut signul, sure enough.
But though the stcamer was under weigh, he might not be on bourd;
hc might not hve got the letter; he might not choose to come.-Ahundred
fears poured one ovcr the other into the little heart, as fst as the waves
on to the Dyke.
The bont followed the smoke into sight. Georgy had a dandy telescope,
and got the vessel under view in the most skilful mnner. And he made

he signal of nn English stenmer in sight went fluttering up to the mst
on the pier. I dare sny MIrs. Amelia's henrt was in a similar flutter.
lEmmy tried to look through the telescope over George's shoulder, bu:
she could make nothing of it. he only saw a blaek eclipse bobbing up
and down belore her eyes.
George took the glass again and raked the vessel. e Ho she does
piteh.'' he said.  There goes a wave slap over her bows. There's onl
two people on deck besides the steersman. There's a man lying dowi.

clapped to the telescope and flung his arms round his mother. As for thI
lady : let us say what she did in the words of a favonrite poet-Aapes
yaeaea. She was sure it was William. It could be no other. WH:
she had said about hoping that he would not come was all hypocrisy.
Of course he would come: what could he do else but come She knen
he would come.
The ship came swiftly nenrer and nearer. As they went in to mcel
her at the landing-plce at the uay, Emmy's knees trembled so that sl
scarcely could run. She would have liked to kneel down and say lr
prayers of thanks there. Oh, she thought, she would be all her lit
saying them l
It was snch n bnd day that as the vessel came alongside of the nay
there were no idlers abrond; scnrcely cven a commissioner on the look-out
for the few passengers in the ateamer. That young scape-grace George
had fled too: and ans the gentleman in the old cloak lined with red stu
stepped on to the shorc, there was scarcely any one present to see wht
took place, which wns briefly this:
A lndy in a dripping white bonnet and shal, with her two little han
ont before her, went up to him, and in the next minute she had altogether
lisappenred mnder the folds of the old clok, and was kissing one of his
hands with all her might; whilst the other, I suppose, was cngnged in
hiolding her to his henrt (hich her ead just about reached) and in pre-
venting her from tumbling down. She was murmuring something abou
-forgive-lenr Williamn-denr, dear, learest friend-kiss, kiss, kiss, an.
so forth-and in fact went on under the cloak in an absurd mnner.
Whon Emmy cmerged from it, she still kept tight hold of one o:
Willian's hnnds, nnl looked up in his face. It was full of sadness nnl
tenler love and pity. She understood its repronch, and hung don
her heud.
It was time you sent for me, dear Amclia,'' le snid.
:e You will nver go again, Willinm.''
tNo, nevaer,'' he nnswered: and pressed the dear little sonl once morc
to his heart.
As they issued out of the Custom-house precincts, Georgy broke out o
them, with his telescope up to his eye, and a loud laugh of welcome; he
daneed round the couple, and performed many facetious nntics as he lel

Perhaps it was compunction towards the kind and simple creature, who
had been the first in life to defend her, perhaps it was a dislike to all such
sentimental scenes,-but Rebeeca, satisfied withi her part in the transaction,
never presented herself before Colonel Dobbin and the lady whom he
marricd. ``Purticulnr business,'' she snid, took her to Bruges, whithct
she went; and only Georgy and his unele were present at the marriagec
ceremony. When it wus over, and deorgy had rejoined his parents, Mrs.
lBecky returned (just for a few days) to comfort the solitary bchelor
Joseph Sedley. He preferred a continental life, he said, and declined to
join in housekeeping with his sister and her husbnnd.
Lmny was very glal in ler heart to thinuk that sle hnl written to ler
husbaud before she read or knew of thnt letter of George's. I knew it
all along,'' William said; ``but could I use that weapon ngainst the poor
fcllow's memory? It wns that whitch male me suffer so when you--''
 Never speak of that day again,'' IEmmy cried out, so contrite nnd
humble, tht William turncel otl the conversation, by his nccount of Glorvina
and lear old Peggy O'Dowd, with whom he was sitting when the letter
of rccall reached him. `' If you hadn 't sent for me,'' he ndded with n
laugh, `` who knows whut Glorvina's nae might e now ''
At prcsent it is Glorvina l'osky (now Mrs. Major Posky), she took him
on he death of his first wife; having resolved never to marry out of
thc regiucnt. Lady O'Dowd is also so attached to it thuat, she says, if
nuythiug were to happen to Mick, belal she'dl come back and marry somc

t O'Dowlstown, with a pnck of beagles, and (with the exception of perhaps
their nciglbour, HIoggarty of Castl Hoggart) he is the first man of his
county. 1ler Lalyship still dances jigs, and insisted on standing up to thc
MIaster of the Ilorse at the Lord ILieulenant's last ball. IBoth she and
Glorvina deelared that Dobbin hud uscd the latter slea/lly, but osky
falling in, Glorvina was consoled, and  beautiful turb fom laris
appensed the wrath of Laly O'bDowd.
When Colonel Dobbiu quitted the scrviee, which he did immedintely
aftcr his arriage, he rented a pretty little country place in Iapshire,

YANITY FII.
n6t far from ueen's Crawley, where, after the passing of the Reforn
Bill, Sir Pitt and his family constantly resided now. Allidea of a Peerage
was out of the question, the baronet's two seats in Parliament being lost.
He was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that catastrophe, failed in
his health, nnd prophesied the speedy ruin of the Empire.
Ludy Jane and MIrs. Dobbin became great friends-there was a perpetual
crossing of pouy-chaises between the Hall and the Evergreens, the Clo-
nel's place (rented of his friend Mjor Ponto, who was nbrond with his
fuamily.) Her Ladyship was gomother to Mrs. Dobbin's child, which
bore her name, and wne christened by the Rev. James Crawley, wha
succeeled his father in thie living: and a pretty close friendship subsisted
between the two lnds, Gcorge and Rawdon, who hunted nnd shot together
in tle acations, were both entered of the same College at Cambridge, anl
qunrrelled with each other about Lady Jane's danghter, with whom they
were both, of course, in love. A match between George nnd that young
ludy was long a favourite scheme of both tle matrons, though I have heard
thnt MIiss Crawley herself inclined towards her cousin.
Mrs. awdon Crawley's name was neer mentioned by either family.
There were reasons why all shoull be silent regarding her. For whereer
Mr. Josepl Sedley weut, she travellel likewise; and that infatuated man
seemed to be entirely her slate. The Colouel's lawyers informed him that
is brother-in-law had effectel n leavy insurancee upon his life, wlence it
as probable that he hnd been raising money to discharge debts. IIe
proeured prolonged leave of absence from the East India House, and
indeel his infirmities were daily increasing.
On learing the news about the insuranee, Amelia, in a good deal of
alarm, entreated her husband to go to Brussels, where Jos then was, and
inquire into the state of his afuirs. The Colonel quitted home with
reluotancee (Ior he was deeply immersed in his ' IHistory of the Punjaub,''
whielh still occupies him, and much nlarmedl about his little daughter,
whom he idolizes, and wlo was just reeovering from tle ohicken-pox), and
went to Brussels and found Jos living at one of the euormous hotels in
that city. Mrs, Crawley, who had her carriage, gave entertainments, and
lived in a ery genteel manner, oceupied another suite of apartments in the
same hotel.
The Colonel, of course, did not desire to see thnt lady, or even think
proper to notify his arrival at Brussels, except privately to Jos by a
messeage through his valet. Jos begged the Colonel to come and see him
that night, when Mrs. Crawley would be at a aoiree, and when they could
meet alone. He found his brother-in-law in a condition of pitiabhle infir-
mity; and dreadfully afraid of Rebecca, though eager in his praises of her.
She tenled him through a series of unheard-of illuesses, with a fdelity
most admnirable. She had been a dnughter to him.  But-but-oh fon
Go's sake, do come and live near me, and-and-see me sometimes,''
whimpered out the unfortunate man.
The Colonel's brow darkened at this. We can't, Jos,'' he ssid.
' Considering the circumstances, Amelia can't visit you.''
I swear to you-I swear to you on the Bible,'' gasped out Joseph,

wanting to kiss the book, `` that she is as innoont as a child, as spotless
as your own wife,''
 It may be so,'' said the Colonel, gloomily; ``but Emmy can't come
to you. Be a man, Jos: break off this disreputable connexion. Come
home to your family. We hear your affairs are iuvolved.''
'Involved1'' cried Ios.  Who has told sueh calumnies? All my
money is placed out most advantageously. rs. Crawley-that is-I
mean,-it is laid out to the best interest.''
 You are not in deht then Why did you insure your lif9 ''
 I thought-a little present to her-in case anything happened ; and
you know my henlth is so delicate-common gratitude you kno-nnd I
intend to leave all my muey to you-and I can aspare it out of my ineome,
indeed Ican,'' oried oit William's weak hrother-in-law.
The Colonel hesought os to fly at onee-to go haok to India, whither
MIrs. Crawlay could not follow him; to do anything to breakoff a con-
ncxion which might hve the iest fatal consequenees to him.
Jos clasped his hands, and aficd,- He waonld go back to Iudia.  Ha
would do anjthing: nly he must hae time: they must'nt sny anything
to MIrs. Crawley :-he'd-she'd kill me if eho knew it. ou don't kno
what a terrible woman she is,'' the poor wreteh said.
 Then, why net eeme away with me'' sid Dobin in reply; but Jos
had uot the courage.'  He woull see Dobbin again in the iorning; he
mnust on no aecount siy thathe had been tlere. ke mhuit go now. Becky
ight come in.'' And Dabbin qitted lim full of forebodings.
He never saw los more. Three montls afterwards Joseph iSedley died at
Aix-la-Chapelle. It was found that all his property lad bcen muddled away
in speculations, mnd was represented by valueless shares in different bubble
companies. All his available assets voe the two thonsand pounds for
which his life was isured, and which were left equally betwcen his beloved
``sister Amclia, wife of, &c., and his friend and invalusble attendunt during
sickness, Rebecca, wife of Lieutennnt-Colouel llawdon Craley, CB.,'' who
was appointed administratrix.
The solicitor of thie Insurance Company swore it was the blackest case
tlat ever had come before him; talked of sending a commission to Aix to
samie into the deth, nd tle Compay reused paent of the poliey.
But Mrs., or Lady Crawley, s she slylecl herself, cime to town at onee
(attended with her iolicitors, Messrs. Burke, Thurtell, and Ilayes, ot
Thavies Inn,) nnd dared tho Company to refuse the pnyment. They invited
examination. they declared that she was the object of nan infamous conspiracy,
which ha been pursuing her all through life, and triumphed finally. The
money was paid, and her charaeter established, but Colonel Dobbin sent
back his share of the legacy to the Insuranee Offios, and rigidly declined to
hold any communion with Rebecea.
She neer was Lndy Crawley, though she eontinued so to call herelf.
His Excelleney Colonel Rawdon Crsley died of yellow fever st Coventry
Island, most deeply beloved and deplored, and six weeks before the demise
of his brother, Sir Pitt. The estate consequently deoled upon the
present Sir Rawdon Crawley, Bart.

AITY FAIR.
He, too, has deelined to see his mother, to whom he makes a liberal alloe-
rnce; and who, besides, appears to be ery wealthy. The Baronet lives
etirely at ueen's Ciawley, with Lady Jane and her danghter; whilst
ltebecca, Lady Crawley, chiefly hangs about Bath and Cheltenham, where a
very strong party of excellent people consider her to be a most injured
woman. She has her enemies. Who has not Her life is her answer to
them. She busies herself in works of piety. She goes to church, and never
without a footman. Her name is in all the Clarity Lists. The Destitute
Oruge-girl, the Negleeted Washerroman, the Distressed Muffin-man, find
in her u fanst and generous friend. She is always having atnlls at Fancy
1Fairs for the benefit of these hapless beings. Emmy, her eclildren, and the
Colonel, comiug to London some time back, found themselves suddenly
before her at one of these fairs. She cnst down her eyes demurely and
smiled as they started away from her; Emmy skurrying off on the arm of
George, (now grown a dashing yoeung gentleman,) and the Colonel seizing
up his littlec Janey, of wvhom he is fonder than of anything in the world-
ionler even than of his ` History of the Punjaub.''
Fonder than he is of me,'' Emmy thinks, with a sigh. But he never
said a word to Amelia thnt was not kind aud gentle; or thought of a
want of hers that he did not try to gratify.
