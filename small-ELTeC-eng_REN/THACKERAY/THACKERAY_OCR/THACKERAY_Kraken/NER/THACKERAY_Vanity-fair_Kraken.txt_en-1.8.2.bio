The O
truth O
is O
, O
when O
we O

of O
a O

that O
he O
lives O

nothing O

to O
signify O
something O
unknown O

ing O
, O
simply O
, O
that O
we O

how O
the O

defrays O
the O

of O

Now O
, O
our O

a O

To O
use O
a O

the O

that O
the O

he O
would O
often O
ask O
the O

It O
was O
because O

not O

into O

she O
poured O
her O
sentimental O

unreservedly O
, O
and O
into O
his O
only O
. O
The O
very O
joy O
of O
this O
woman O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
grief O
, O
or O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
its O
expression O
was O
tears O

Her O
sensihilities O
were O
so O
weak O

tremulous O
, O
that O
perhaps O
they O
ought O
not O

talked O
about O
in O
a O

I O
was O
told O
by O

Pestler E-PERSON
, O
( O
now O
a O
most O

, O
and O
a O

quare O
, O
) O
that O
her O
grief O
at O
weaning O
the O
child O
was O
a O
sight O
that O
would O
have O
unmanned O
a O
Herod S-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
many O
yenrs O
ago O
, O
and O
his O
wife O
was O
mortally O
jealous O
of O
Mrs. O
Amelia S-PERSON
, O
then O
and O
long O
afterwards O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
Doctor's O
lady O
had O
good O
reason O
for O
her O
jealousy O
: O
most O
women O
shared O
it O
, O
of O
those O
who O
formed O
the O
small O
circle O
of O
Amelia's S-NORP
aequaintance O
, O
and O
were O
quite O
angry O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
with O
whioh O
the O
other O
sex O
regarded O
her O
. O
For O
almost O
all O
men O
who O
came O
nenr O
her O
loved O
her O
| | O
though O
no O
doubt O
they O
would O
be O
at O
n O
loss O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
She O
was O
ot O
brilliant O
, O
nor O
witty O
, O
nor O
wise O
overmueh O
, O
nor O
extraordinarily O
handsome O
. O
But O
whereer O
she O
went O
she O
touched O
and O
charmed O
eery O
one O
of O
the O
male O
sex O
, O
as O
invuariably O
as O
she O
awakened O
the O
scorn O
and O
inerelulity O
of O
her O
own O
sisterhood O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
her O
weakess O
which O
was O
her O
principal O
charm O
:- O
a O
kind O
of O
sweet O
submission O
and O
softness O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
appeal O
to O
each O
mnn O
she O
met O
for O
his O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
in O
the O

, O
though O
she O
spoke O
but O
to O
few O
of O

all O
the O

of O
the O

The O

by O
a O
kind O
of O

absolutely O
neglected O

did O
not O

it O
wss O
brought O
about O
by O

after O
her O
cslamity O
, O
and O
after O
many O
struggles O
t O
keep O
up O

as O
a O

who O
goes O
overboard O

any O
hope O
is O
left O
, O
and O
then O
flings O
it O
away O
and O
goes O
down O
, O
when O
he O
finds O
that O
struggling O
is O
in O
vain O
. O
She O
lingered O
about O
London S-GPE
whilst O
her O

was O
making O
preparations O
for O
his O
departure O

it O
is O

more B-CARDINAL

sneaked O

indeed O
never O

Probably O

Mrs. O

would O
not O
try O
to O
force O

she O
looked O
curiously O
at O
the O
superscriptions O
of O
all O
the O
letters O
which O
arrived O
for O
Sir O

, O
lest O

at O

after O

consented O

A O

- O
as O
I O
have O
no O

that O
the O

it O
