Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O
papa O
was O
a O
merchant O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
and O
a O
man O
of O
some O
wealth O
; O


whereas O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
was O
an O
articled O
pupil O
, O
for O
whom O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
had O
done O
, O


as O
she O
thought O
, O
quite O
enough O
, O
without O
conferring O
upon O
her O
at O
parting O
the O


high O
honour O
of O
the O
Dixonary O
. O


Although O
schoolmistresses O
’ O
letters O
are O
to O
be O
trusted O
no O
more O
nor O
less O
than O


churchyard O
epitaphs O
; O
yet O
, O
as O
it O
sometimes O
happens O
that O
a O
person O
departs O
this O


life O
, O
who O
is O
really O
deserving O
of O
all O
the O
praises O
the O
stone O
- O
cutter O
carves O


over O
his O
bones O
; O
who O

is O

a O
good O
Christian B-NORP
, O
a O
good O
parent O
, O
child O
, O


wife O
, O
or O
husband O
; O
who O
actually O

does O

leave O
a O
disconsolate O
family O
to O


mourn O
his O
loss O
; O
so O
in O
academies O
of O
the O
male O
and O
female O
sex O
it O
occurs O
every O


now O
and O
then O
, O
that O
the O
pupil O
is O
fully O
worthy O
of O
the O
praises O
bestowed O
by O
the O


disinterested O
instructor O
. O
Now O
, O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
this O


singular O
species O
; O
and O
deserved O
not O
only O
all O
that O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
said O
in O
her O


praise O
, O
but O
had O
many O
charming O
qualities O
which O
that O
pompous O
old O
Minerva B-PERSON
of O
a O


woman O
could O
not O
see O
, O
from O
the O
differences O
of O
rank O
and O
age O
between O
her O
pupil O


and O
herself O
. O


For O
she O
could O
not O
only O
sing O
like O
a O
lark O
, O
or O
a O
Mrs. O
Billington B-PERSON
, O
and O
dance O


like O
Hillisberg B-GPE
or O
Parisot O
; O
and O
embroider O
beautifully O
; O
and O
spell O
as O
well O
as O


a O
Dixonary O
itself O
; O
but O
she O
had O
such O
a O
kindly O
, O
smiling O
, O
tender O
, O
gentle O
, O


generous O
heart O
of O
her O
own O
, O
as O
won O
the O
love O
of O
everybody O
who O
came O
near O
her O
, O


from O
Minerva B-PERSON
herself O
down O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
in O
the O
scullery O
, O
and O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
- O
eyed O


tart O
- O
woman O
’s O
daughter O
, O
who O
was O
permitted O
to O
vend O
her O
wares O
once O
a O
week O
to O


the O
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
Mall B-FAC
. O
She O
had O
twelve B-CARDINAL
intimate O
and O
bosom O
friends O
out O


of O
the O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O
. O
Even O
envious O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
never O
spoke O
ill O
of O


her O
, O
high O
and O
mighty O
Miss B-PERSON
Saltire I-PERSON
( O
Lord O
Dexter B-PERSON
’s O
granddaughter O
) O
allowed O
that O


her O
figure O
was O
genteel O
; O
and O
as O
for O
Miss O
Swartz B-PERSON
, O
the O
rich O
woolly O
- O
haired O


mulatto O
from O
St. B-GPE
Kitt I-GPE
’s I-GPE
, O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
Amelia B-PERSON
went O
away O
, O
she O
was O
in O
such O
a O


passion O
of O
tears O
, O
that O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
send O
for O
Dr. O
Floss B-PERSON
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL


tipsify O
her O
with O
salvolatile O
. O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
’s O
attachment O
was O
, O
as O
may O
be O


supposed O
, O
from O
the O
high O
position O
and O
eminent O
virtues O
of O
that O
lady O
, O
calm O
and O


dignified O
; O
but O
Miss O
Jemima B-PERSON
had O
already O
whimpered O
several O
times O
at O
the O
idea O


of O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
departure O
; O
and O
, O
but O
for O
fear O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
would O
have O
gone O
off O


in O
downright O
hysterics O
, O
like O
the O
heiress O
( O
who O
paid O
double O
) O
of O
St. B-GPE
Kitt I-GPE
’s I-GPE
. O


Such O
luxury O
of O
grief O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O
allowed O
to O
parlour O
- O
boarders O
. O
Honest O


Jemima B-PERSON
had O
all O
the O
bills O
, O
and O
the O
washing O
, O
and O
the O
mending O
, O
and O
the O


puddings O
, O
and O
the O
plate O
and O
crockery O
, O
and O
the O
servants O
to O
superintend O
. O
But O


why O
speak O
about O
her O
? O
It O
is O
probable O
that O
we O
shall O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
again O
from O


this O
moment O
to O
the O
end O
of O
time O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
great O
filigree O
iron O
gates O


are O
once O
closed O
on O
her O
, O
she O
and O
her O
awful O
sister O
will O
never O
issue O
therefrom O


into O
this O
little O
world O
of O
history O
. O


But O
as O
we O
are O
to O
see O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
saying O
, O
at O


the O
outset O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
she O
was O
a O
dear O
little O
creature O
; O
and O
a O


great O
mercy O
it O
is O
, O
both O
in O
life O
and O
in O
novels O
, O
which O
( O
and O
the O
latter O


especially O
) O
abound O
in O
villains O
of O
the O
most O
sombre O
sort O
, O
that O
we O
are O
to O
have O


for O
a O
constant O
companion O
, O
so O
guileless O
and O
good O
- O
natured O
a O
person O
. O
As O
she O
is O


not O
a O
heroine O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
describe O
her O
person O
; O
indeed O
I O
am O
afraid O


that O
her O
nose O
was O
rather O
short O
than O
otherwise O
, O
and O
her O
cheeks O
a O
great O
deal O


too O
round O
and O
red O
for O
a O
heroine O
; O
but O
her O
face O
blushed O
with O
rosy O
health O
, O
and O


her O
lips O
with O
the O
freshest O
of O
smiles O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes O
which O


sparkled O
with O
the O
brightest O
and O
honestest O
good O
- O
humour O
, O
except O
indeed O
when O


they O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
and O
that O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
often O
; O
for O
the O
silly O


thing O
would O
cry O
over O
a O
dead O
canary O
- O
bird O
; O
or O
over O
a O
mouse O
, O
that O
the O
cat O
haply O


had O
seized O
upon O
; O
or O
over O
the O
end O
of O
a O
novel O
, O
were O
it O
ever O
so O
stupid O
; O
and O
as O


for O
saying O
an O
unkind O
word O
to O
her O
, O
were O
any O
persons O
hard O
- O
hearted O
enough O
to O
do O


so O
— O
why O
, O
so O
much O
the O
worse O
for O
them O
. O
Even O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
, O
that O
austere O
and O


god O
- O
like O
woman O
, O
ceased O
scolding O
her O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
though O
she O
no O


more O
comprehended O
sensibility O
than O
she O
did O
Algebra O
, O
gave O
all O
masters O
and O


teachers O
particulars O
orders O
to O
treat O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
with O
the O
utmost O
gentleness O
, O


as O
harsh O
treatment O
was O
injurious O
to O
her O
. O


So O
that O
when O
the O
day O
of O
departure O
came O
, O
between O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
customs O
of O
laughing O


and O
crying O
, O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
greatly O
puzzled O
how O
to O
act O
. O
She O
was O
glad O
to O
go O


home O
, O
and O
yet O
most O
wofully O
sad O
at O
leaving O
school O
. O
For O

little O
Laura B-PERSON
Martin I-PERSON

the O

the B-TIME

; O


and O
the O
grief O

was O
considerably O
lessened O
by O
the O
admirable O


discourse O
which O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
addressed O
to O
her O
pupil O

Not O
that O
the O
parting O


speech O
caused O
Amelia B-PERSON
to O
philosophise O

or O
that O
it O
armed O
her O
in O
any O
way O
with O
a O


calmness O

the O
result O
of O

; O
but O
it O
was O
intolerably O
dull O

pompous O

tedious O
; O
and O
having O
the O
fear O
of O
her O
schoolmistress O
greatly O
before O

Miss O

Miss O

I O

 O
As O

Miss O

only O
folded O
her O

with O
a O
very O
frigid O
smile O

bow O

and O


quite O
declined O
to O
accept O
the O

on O
which O
Semiramis B-ORG
tossed O
up O


her O

more O
indignantly O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
a O

the O

 O


And O
the O
kind O
creature O
retreated O
into O
the O
garden O
, O
overcome O
with O
emotion O
. O


But O
, O
lo O
! O
and O
just O
as O
the O
coach O
drove O
off O
, O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
put O
her O
pale O
face O
out O


of O
the O
window O
and O
actually O
flung O
the O
book O
back O
into O
the O
garden O
. O


This O
almost O
caused O
Jemima B-PERSON
to O
faint O
with O
terror O
. O
 O
Well O
, O
I O
never,—said O


she—what O
an O
audacious—Emotion O
prevented O
her O
from O
completing O
either O


sentence O

The O
carriage O
rolled O
away O
; O
the O
great O

were O
closed O

II O
. O
In O
Which O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
and O
Miss B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
Prepare I-PERSON
to O
Open O
the O


Campaign O


WHEN O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
had O
performed O
the O
heroical O
act O
mentioned O
in O
the O
last O
chapter O
, O


and O
had O
seen O
the O
Dixonary O
, O
flying O
over O
the O
pavement O
of O
the O
little O
garden O
, O


fall O
at O
length O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
the O
astonished O
Miss O
Jemima B-PERSON
, O
the O
young O
lady O
’s O


countenance O
, O
which O
had O
before O
worn O
an O
almost O
livid O
look O
of O
hatred O
, O
assumed O
a O


smile O
that O
perhaps O
was O
scarcely O
more O
agreeable O
, O
and O
she O
sank O
back O
in O
the O


carriage O
in O
an O
easy O
frame O
of O
mind O
, O
saying—So B-PERSON
much O
for O
the O
Dixonary O
; O
and O
, O


thank O
God O
, O
I O
’m O
out O
of O
Chiswick B-GPE
. O
 O


Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
almost O
as O
flurried O
at O
the O
act O
of O
defiance O
as O
Miss O
Jemima B-PERSON


had O
been O
; O
for O
, O
consider O
, O
it O
was O
but O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
that O
she O
had O
left O
school O
, O
and O


the O
impressions O
of O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
are O
not O
got O
over O
in O
that O
space O
of O
time O
. O
Nay B-PERSON
, O


with O
some O
persons O
those O
awes O
and O
terrors O
of O
youth O
last O
for O
ever O
and O
ever O
. O
I O


know O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
an O
old O
gentleman O
of O
sixty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
, O
who O
said O
to O
me O
one B-TIME


morning I-TIME
at O
breakfast O
, O
with O
a O
very O
agitated O
countenance O
, O
 O
I O
dreamed O
last O


night O
that O
I O
was O
flogged O
by O
Dr. O
Raine B-PERSON
. O
 O
Fancy B-PERSON
had O
carried O
him O
back O


five B-DATE
- I-DATE
and I-DATE
- I-DATE
fifty I-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
the O
course O
of O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O
Dr. O
Raine B-PERSON
and O
his O
rod O


were O
just O
as O
awful O
to O
him O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
then O
, O
at O
sixty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
, O
as O
they O
had O


been O
at O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
. O
If O
the O
Doctor O
, O
with O
a O
large O
birch O
, O
had O
appeared O
bodily O
to O


him O
, O
even O
at O
the O
age O
of O
threescore O
and O
eight O
, O
and O
had O
said O
in O
awful O
voice O
, O


 O
boy O
, O
take O
down O
your O
pant O
… O
? O
 O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
exceedingly O
alarmed O


at O
this O
act O
of O
insubordination O
. O


 O
How O
could O
you O
do O
so O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
? O
 O
at O
last O
she O
said O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
. O


 O
Why O
, O
do O
you O
think O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
will O
come O
out O
and O
order O
me O
back O
to O
the O


black O
- O
hole O
? O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
. O


 O
No O
: O
but O
— O
— O
 O


 O
I O
hate O
the O
whole O
house O
, O
 O
continued O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
in O
a O
fury O
. O
 O
I O
hope O
I O
may O


never O
set O
eyes O
on O
it O
again O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
were O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
Thames B-GPE
, O
I O


do O
; O
and O
if O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
were O
there O
, O
I O
would O
n’t O
pick O
her O
out O
, O
that O
I O


would O
n’t O
. O
O O
how O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
her O
floating O
in O
the O
water O
yonder O
, O


turban O
and O
all O
, O
with O
her O
train O
streaming O
after O
her O
, O
and O
her O
nose O
like O
the O


beak O
of O
a O
wherry O
. O
 O


 O
Hush B-PERSON
! O
 O
cried O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
. O


 O
Why O
, O
will O
the O
black O
footman O
tell O
tales O
? O
 O
cried O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
. O
 O
He O


may O
go O
back O
and O
tell O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
that O
I O
hate O
her O
with O
all O
my O
soul O
; O
and O
I O


wish O
he O
would O
; O
and O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
a O
means O
of O
proving O
it O
, O
too O
. O
For O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
I O


have O
only O
had O
insults O
and O
outrage O
from O
her O
. O
I O
have O
been O
treated O
worse O
than O


any O
servant O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
friend O
or O
a O
kind O
word O
, O
except O


from O
you O
. O
I O
have O
been O
made O
to O
tend O
the O
little O
girls O
in O
the O
lower O
schoolroom O
, O


and O
to O
talk O
French B-NORP
to O
the O
Misses O
, O
until O
I O
grew O
sick O
of O
my O
mother O
- O
tongue O
. O
But O


that O
talking O
French B-NORP
to O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
was O
capital O
fun O
, O
was O
n’t O
it O
? O
She O


does O
n’t O
know O
a O
word O
of O
French B-NORP
, O
and O
was O
too O
proud O
to O
confess O
it O
. O
I O
believe O
it O


was O
that O
which O
made O
her O
part O
with O
me O
; O
and O
so O
thank O
Heaven O
for O
French B-NORP
. O


Vive O

Vive B-PERSON

! O
 O


 O
O O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
for O
shame O
! O
 O
cried O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
; O
for O
this O
was O
the O


greatest O
blasphemy O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
as O
yet O
uttered O
; O
and O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
in O


England B-GPE
, O
to O
say O
, O
 O
Long O
live O
Bonaparte B-PERSON
! O
 O
was O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
 O
Long O
live O


Lucifer B-PERSON
! O
 O
 O
How O
can O
you O
— O
how O
dare O
you O
have O
such O
wicked O
, O
revengeful O


thoughts O
? O
 O


 O
Revenge O
may O
be O
wicked O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
natural O
, O
 O
answered O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
I O
’m O
no O


angel O
. O
 O
And O
, O
to O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
she O
certainly O
was O
not O
. O


For O
it O
may O
be O
remarked O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
little O
conversation O
( O
which O


took O
place O
as O
the O
coach O
rolled O
along O
lazily O
by O
the O
river O
side O
) O
that O
though O


Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp I-PERSON
has O
twice O
had O
occasion O
to O
thank O
Heaven O
, O
it O
has O
been O
, O
in O


the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
for O
ridding O
her O
of O
some O
person O
whom O
she O
hated O
, O
and O


secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
for O
enabling O
her O
to O
bring O
her O
enemies O
to O
some O
sort O
of O
perplexity O


or O
confusion O
; O
neither O
of O
which O
are O
very O
amiable O
motives O
for O
religious O


gratitude O
, O
or O
such O
as O
would O
be O
put O
forward O
by O
persons O
of O
kind O
and O
placable O


disposition O
. O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
not O
, O
then O
, O
in O
the O
least O
kind O
or O
placable O
. O
All O


the O
world O
used O
her O
ill O
, O
said O
this O
young O
misanthropist B-NORP
, O
and O
we O
may O
be O
pretty O


certain O
that O
persons O
whom O
all O
the O
world O
treats O
ill O
deserve O
entirely O
the O


treatment O
they O
get O
. O
The O
world O
is O
a O
looking O
- O
glass O
, O
and O
gives O
back O
to O
every O


man O
the O
reflection O
of O
his O
own O
face O
. O
Frown O
at O
it O
, O
and O
it O
will O
in O
turn O
look O


sourly O
upon O
you O
; O
laugh O
at O
it O
and O
with O
it O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
jolly O
kind O
companion O
; O


and O
so O
let O
all O
young O
persons O
take O
their O
choice O
. O
This O
is O
certain O
, O
that O
if O
the O


world O
neglected O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
, O
she O
never O
was O
known O
to O
have O
done O
a O
good O
action O


in O
behalf O
of O
anybody O
; O
nor O
can O
it O
be O
expected O
that O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
young O
ladies O


should O
all O
be O
as O
amiable O
as O
the O
heroine O
of O
this O
work O
, O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
( O
whom O
we O


have O
selected O
for O
the O
very O
reason O
that O
she O
was O
the O
best O
- O
natured O
of O
all O
, O


otherwise O
what O
on O
earth O
was O
to O
have O
prevented O
us O
from O
putting O
up O
Miss O


Swartz B-PERSON
, O
or O
Miss O
Crump B-PERSON
, O
or O
Miss B-PERSON
Hopkins I-PERSON
, O
as O
heroine O
in O
her O
place?)—it B-WORK_OF_ART
could O


not O
be O
expected O
that O
every O
one O
should O
be O
of O
the O
humble O
and O
gentle O
temper O
of O


Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
; O
should O
take O
every O
opportunity O
to O
vanquish O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O


hard O
- O
heartedness O
and O
ill O
- O
humor O
; O
and O
, O
by O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
kind O
words O
and O
offices O
, O


overcome O
, O
for O
once O
at O
least O
, O
her O
hostility O
to O
her O
kind O
. O


Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
’s O
father O
was O
an O
artist O
, O
and O
in O
that O
quality O
had O
given O
lessons O
of O


drawing O
at O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
school O
. O
He O
was O
a O
clever O
man O
; O
a O
pleasant O


companion O
; O
a O
careless O
student O
; O
with O
a O
great O
propensity O
for O
running O
into O


debt O
, O
and O
a O
partiality O
for O
the O
tavern O
. O
When O
he O
was O
drunk O
, O
he O
used O
to O
beat O


his O
wife O
and O
daughter O
; O
and O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
with O
a O
headache O
, O
he O
would O
rail O


at O
the O
world O
for O
its O
neglect O
of O
his O
genius O
, O
and O
abuse O
, O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O


cleverness O
, O
and O
sometimes O
with O
perfect O
reason O
, O
the O
fools O
, O
his O
brother O


painters O
. O
As O
it O
was O
with O
the O
utmost O
difficulty O
that O
he O
could O
keep O
himself O
, O


and O
as O
he O
owed O
money O
for O
a B-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
round O
Soho B-ORG
, O
where O
he O
lived O
, O
he O
thought O
to O


better O
his O
circumstances O
by O
marrying O
a O
young O
woman O
of O
the O
French B-NORP
nation O
, O
who O


was O
by O
profession O
an O
opera O
- O
girl O
. O
The O
humble O
calling O
of O
her O
female O
parent O
, O


Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
never O
alluded O
to O
, O
but O
used O
to O
state O
subsequently O
that O
the O


Entrechats B-PERSON
were O
a O
noble O
family O
of O
Gascony B-PERSON
, O
and O
took O
great O
pride O
in O
her O


descent O
from O
them O
. O
And O
curious O
it O
is O
, O
that O
as O
she O
advanced O
in O
life O
this O


young O
lady O
’s O
ancestors O
increased O
in O
rank O
and O
splendour O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
mother O
had O
had O
some O
education O
somewhere O
, O
and O
the O
daughter O
spoke O


French B-NORP
with O
purity O
and O
a O
Parisian B-NORP
accent O
. O
It O
was O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
rather O
a O
rare O


accomplishment O
, O
and O
led O
to O
her O
engagement O
with O
the O
orthodox O
Miss O
Pinkerton B-PERSON
. O


For O
her O
mother O
being O
dead O
, O
her O
father O
, O
finding O
himself O
not O
likely O
to O


recover O
, O
after O
his O
third B-ORDINAL
attack O
of O

delirium O
tremens O
, O

wrote O
a O
manly O


and O
pathetic O
letter O
to O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
, O
recommending O
the O
orphan O
child O
to O
her O


protection O
, O
and O
so O
descended O
to O
the O
grave O
, O
after O
two B-CARDINAL
bailiffs O
had O
quarrelled O


over O
his O
corpse O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
seventeen B-DATE
when O
she O
came O
to O
Chiswick B-GPE
, O
and O
was O


bound O
over O
as O
an O
articled O
pupil O
; O
her O
duties O
being O
to O
talk O
French B-NORP
, O
as O
we O
have O


seen O
; O
and O
her O
privileges O
to O
live O
cost O
free O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
guineas I-MONEY
a O
year O
, O


to O
gather O
scraps O
of O
knowledge O
from O
the O
professors O
who O
attended O
the O


school O

She O
was O
small O
and O
slight O
in O
person O
; O
pale O
, O
sandy O
- O
haired O
, O
and O
with O
eyes O


habitually O
cast O
down O
: O
when O
they O
looked O
up O
they O
were O
very O
large O
, O
odd O
, O
and O


attractive O
; O
so O
attractive O
, O
that O
the O
Reverend O
Mr. O
Crisp B-PERSON
, O
fresh O
from O
Oxford B-ORG
, O


and O
curate O
to O
the B-ORG
Vicar I-ORG
of I-ORG
Chiswick I-ORG
, O
the O
Reverend O
Mr. O
Flowerdew B-PERSON

fell O
in O


love O
with O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
; O
being O
shot O
dead O
by O
a O
glance O
of O
her O
eyes O
which O
was O


fired O
all O
the O
way O
across O
Chiswick B-ORG
Church I-ORG
from O
the O
school O
- O
pew O
to O
the O


reading O
- O
desk O
. O
This O
infatuated O
young O
man O
used O
sometimes O
to O
take O
tea O
with O
Miss O


Pinkerton B-PERSON
, O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
presented O
by O
his O
mamma O
, O
and O
actually O
proposed O


something O
like O
marriage O
in O
an O
intercepted O
note O
, O
which O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
- O
eyed O


apple O
- O
woman O
was O
charged O
to O
deliver O
. O
Mrs. O
Crisp B-PERSON
was O
summoned O
from O
Buxton B-ORG
, O
and O


abruptly O
carried O
off O
her O
darling O
boy O
; O
but O
the O
idea O
, O
even O
, O
of O
such O
an O
eagle O


in O
the O
Chiswick B-GPE
dovecot O
caused O
a O
great O
flutter O
in O
the O
breast O
of O
Miss O


Pinkerton B-PERSON
, O
who O
would O
have O
sent O
away O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
, O
but O
that O
she O
was O
bound O
to O


her O
under O
a O
forfeit O
, O
and O
who O
never O
could O
thoroughly O
believe O
the O
young O
lady O
’s O


protestations O
that O
she O
had O
never O
exchanged O
a O
single O
word O
with O
Mr. O
Crisp B-PERSON

except O
under O
her O
own O
eyes O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
occasions O
when O
she O
had O
met O
him O
at O


tea O

By O
the O
side O
of O
many O
tall O
and O
bouncing O
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
establishment O
, O


Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp I-PERSON
looked O
like O
a O
child O
. O
But O
she O
had O
the O
dismal O
precocity O
of O


poverty O
. O
Many O
a O
dun O
had O

the O

everybody O

his O

was O
a B-CARDINAL

the O

no O

with O
whose O
care O
she O
was O
chiefly O
intrusted O

might O

she O
lived O
among O

The O

 O

she O
speedily O
went O

Rebecca B-PERSON
hit O

 O

Miss O

As O
far O
as O
the O

this O

so O
did O
every O

accepting O
the O
white O

the O

and O
a O
sweet O
sprigged O

small O
for O
her O
, O
though O
it O
would O


fit O
her O
friend O

and O
she O
determined O
in O
her O
heart O
to O
ask O

mother O

permission O

present O
her O
white O
Cashmere B-PERSON

When O

Cashmere B-PRODUCT

which O
Joseph B-PERSON

had O
brought O
home O
to O
his O

she O
said O
, O
with O
perfect O
truth O
, O
 O
that O
it O
must O


be O
delightful O
to O
have O
a O
brother O
, O
 O
and O
easily O
got O
the O
pity O
of O
the O


tender O
- O
hearted O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
for O
being O
alone O
in O
the O
world O

an O

 O
Not O
alone O

 O

 O
you O

I O

 O
Ah O

parents O

who O


give O
you O
everything O
you O
ask O

; O
and O
their O
love O

which O
is O
more O

than O


all O

My O
poor O

could O
give O
me O
nothing O

and O
I O
had O
but O
two B-CARDINAL

Oh O

 O


 O
Only O
Joseph B-PERSON
does O
n’t O
seem O
to O
care O
much O
whether O
I O

not O

He O
gave O


me O
two B-CARDINAL
fingers O
to O
shake O
when O
he O
arrived O
after O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
’ I-DATE
absence O
! O
He O
is O
very O


kind O

good O

but O
he O
scarcely O

me O
; O
I O
think O
he O
loves O
his O
pipe O


a O
great O
deal O
better O
than O
his O
 O
… O
but O
here O
Amelia B-PERSON
checked O
herself O
, O
for O
why O


should O
she O
speak O
ill O
of O
her O
brother O
? O
 O
He O
was O
very O
kind O
to O
me O
as O
a O

, O
 O


she O
added O
; O
 O
I O
was O
but O
five B-DATE

when O
he O
went O
away O

 O


 O
Is O

he O
very O
rich O
? O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
They O
say O
all O
Indian B-NORP
nabobs O
are O


enormously O
rich O
. O
 O


 O
I O
believe O
he O
has O
a O
very O
large O

 O


 O
And O
is O
your O

! O
Joseph B-PERSON
is O
not O
married O

 O
said O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
again O
. O


Perhaps O
she O
had O
mentioned O
the O
fact O
already O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
but O
that O
young O
lady O


did O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
remembered O
it O
; O
indeed O
, O
vowed O
and O
protested O
that O
she O


expected O
to O
see O
a O
number O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
nephews O
and O
nieces O
. O
She O
was O
quite O


disappointed O
that O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
not O
married O
; O
she O
was O
sure O
Amelia B-PERSON
had O
said O


he O
was O
, O
and O
she O
doted O
so O
on O
little O
children O
. O


 O
I O
think O
you O
must O
have O
had O
enough O
of O
them O
at O
Chiswick B-GPE
, O
 O
said O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
rather O


wondering O
at O
the O
sudden O
tenderness O
on O
her O
friend O
’s O
part O
; O
and O
indeed O
in O
later B-DATE


days I-DATE
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
would O
never O
have O
committed O
herself O
so O
far O
as O
to O
advance O


opinions O
, O
the O
untruth O
of O
which O
would O
have O
been O
so O
easily O
detected O
. O
But O
we O


must O
remember O
that O
she O
is O
but O
nineteen B-DATE
as O
yet O
, O
unused O
to O
the O
art O
of O


deceiving O
, O
poor O
innocent O
creature O

and O
making O
her O
own O
experience O
in O
her O

The O
meaning O
of O
the O
above O
series O
of O
queries O
, O
as O
translated O
in O
the O


heart O
of O
this O
ingenious O
young O
woman O
, O
was O
simply O
this:—If B-NORP
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON


is O
rich O
and O
unmarried O
, O
why O
should O
I O
not O
marry O
him O
? O
I O
have O
only O
a O
fortnight O
, O


to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
trying O
. O
 O
And O
she O
determined O
within O


herself O
to O
make O
this O
laudable O
attempt O
. O
She O
redoubled O
her O
caresses O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
; O


she O
kissed O
the O
white O
cornelian O
necklace O
as O
she O
put O
it O
on O
; O
and O
vowed O
she O


would O
never O
, O
never O
part O
with O
it O
. O
When O
the O
dinner O

bell O
rang O
she O
went O
down O


stairs O
with O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
friend O

waist O
, O
as O
is O
the O
habit O
of O
young O


ladies O

She O
was O
so O
agitated O
at O
the O
drawing O

that O
she O
could O
hardly O


find O
courage O

Joseph B-PERSON

home O

when O

He O
had O

Luckily O
, O
at O
this O
time O
he O
caught O
a O
liver O
complaint O
, O
for O
the O
cure O
of O
which O
he O


returned O
to O
Europe B-LOC
, O
and O
which O
was O
the O
source O
of O
great O
comfort O
and O
amusement O


to O
him O
in O
his O
native O
country O
. O
He O
did O
not O
live O
with O
his O
family O
while O
in O


London B-GPE
, O
but O
had O
lodgings O
of O
his O
own O
, O
like O
a O
gay O
young O
bachelor O
. O
Before O
he O


went O
to O
India B-GPE
he O
was O
too O
young O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
delightful O
pleasures O
of O
a O


man O
about O
town O
, O
and O
plunged O
into O
them O
on O
his O
return O
with O
considerable O


assiduity O
. O
He O
drove O
his O
horses O
in O
the O
Park O
; O
he O
dined O
at O
the O
fashionable O


taverns O
( O
for O
the B-ORG
Oriental I-ORG
Club I-ORG
was O
not O
as O
yet O
invented O
) O
; O
he O
frequented O
the O


theatres O
, O
as O
the O
mode O
was O
in O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
or O
made O
his O
appearance O
at O
the O


opera O
, O
laboriously O
attired O
in O
tights O
and O
a O
cocked O
hat O
. O


On O
returning O
to O
India B-GPE
, O
and O
ever O
after O
, O
he O
used O
to O
talk O
of O
the O
pleasure O
of O


this O
period O
of O
his O
existence O
with O
great O
enthusiasm O
, O
and O
give O
you O
to O


understand O
that O
he O
and O
Brummel B-PERSON
were O
the O
leading O
bucks O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
But O
he O
was O


as O
lonely O
here O
as O
in O
his O
jungle O
at O
Boggley B-FAC
Wollah I-FAC
. O
He O
scarcely O
knew O
a O
single O


soul O
in O
the O
metropolis O
: O
and O
were O
it O
not O
for O
his O
doctor O
, O
and O
the O
society O
of O


his O
blue O
- O
pill O
, O
and O
his O
liver O
complaint O
, O
he O
must O
have O
died O
of O
loneliness O
. O
He O


was O
lazy O
, O
peevish O
, O
and O
a O

bon O
- O
vivant O
; O

the O
appearance O
of O
a O
lady O


frightened O
him O
beyond O
measure O
; O
hence O
it O
was O
but O
seldom O
that O
he O
joined O
the O


paternal O
circle O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
where O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
gaiety O
, O
and O


where O
the O
jokes O
of O
his O
good O
natured O
old O
father O
frightened O
his O


amour O
- O
propre O
. O

His O
bulk O
caused O
Joseph B-PERSON
much O
anxious O
thought O
and O


alarm O
; O
now O
and O
then O
he O
would O
make O
a O
desperate O
attempt O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
his O


superabundant O
fat O
; O
but O
his O
indolence O
and O
love O
of O
good O
living O
speedily O
got O


the O
better O
of O
these O
endeavours O
at O
reform O
, O
and O
he O
found O
himself O
again O
at O
his O


three B-DATE
meals I-DATE
a I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
he O
never O
was O
well O
dressed O
; O
but O
he O
took O
the O
hugest O
pains O


to O
adorn O
his O
big O
person O
, O
and O
passed O
many B-TIME
hours I-TIME
daily B-DATE
in O
that O
occupation O
. O
His O


valet O
made O
a O
fortune O
out O
of O
his O
wardrobe O
: O
his O
toilet O
- O
table O
was O
covered O
with O


as O
many O
pomatums O
and O
essences O
as O
ever O
were O
employed O
by O
an O
old O
beauty O
: O
he O
had O


tried O
, O
in O
order O
to O
give O
himself O
a O
waist O
, O
every O
girth O
, O
stay O
, O
and O
waistband O


then O
invented O
. O
Like O
most O
fat O
men O
, O
he O

would O

have O
his O
clothes O
made O


too O
tight O
, O
and O
took O
care O
they O
should O
be O
of O
the O
most O
brilliant O
colours O
and O


youthful O
cut O
. O
When O
dressed O
at O
length O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
he O
would O
issue O
forth O


to O
take O
a O
drive O
with O
nobody O
in O
the O
Park O
; O
and O
then O
would O
come O
back O
in O
order O


to O
dress O
again O
and O
go O
and O
dine O
with O
nobody O
at O
the B-FAC
Piazza I-FAC
Coffee I-FAC
- I-FAC
House I-FAC
. O
He O


was O
as O
vain O
as O
a O
girl O
; O
and O
perhaps O
his O
extreme O
shyness O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O


results O
of O
his O
extreme O
vanity O
. O
If O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
can O
get O
the O
better O
of O


him O
, O

and O
at O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
entrance O
into O
life O
, O
she O
is O
a O
young O
person O


of O
no O
ordinary O
cleverness O
. O


The O
first B-ORDINAL
move O
showed O
considerable O
skill O
. O
When O
she O
called O
Sedley B-PERSON
a O
very O


handsome O
man O
, O
she O
knew O
that O
Amelia B-PERSON
would O
tell O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
would O
probably O


tell O
Joseph B-PERSON
, O
or O
who O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
would O
be O
pleased O
by O
the O
compliment O
paid O
to O


her O
son O
. O
All O
mothers O
are O
. O
If O
you O
had O
told O
Sycorax B-PERSON
that O
her O
son O
Caliban B-PERSON
was O


as O
handsome O
as O
Apollo B-ORG
, O
she O
would O
have O
been O
pleased O
, O
witch O
as O
she O
was O
. O


Perhaps O
, O
too O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
would O
overhear O
the O
compliment O
— O
Rebecca B-PERSON
spoke O
loud O


enough O
— O
and O
he O

did O

hear O
, O
and O
( O
thinking O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
he O
was O
a O


very O
fine O
man O
) O
, O
the O
praise O
thrilled O
through O
every O
fibre O
of O
his O
big O
body O
, O
and O


made O
it O
tingle O
with O
pleasure O
. O


Then O
, O
however O
, O
came O
a O
recoil O
. O
 O
Is O
the O
girl O
making O
fun O
of O
me O
? O
 O
he O
thought O
, O


and O
straightway O
he O
bounced O
towards O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
was O
for O
retreating O
, O
as O
we O


have O
seen O
, O
when O
his O
father O
’s O
jokes O
and O
his O
mother O
’s O
entreaties O
caused O
him O
to O


pause O
and O
stay O
where O
he O
was O
. O
He O
conducted O
the O
young O
lady O
down O
to O
dinner O
in O
a O


dubious O
and O
agitated O
frame O
of O
mind O
. O
 O
Does O
she O
really O
think O
I O
am O
handsome O
? O
 O


thought O
he O
, O
 O
or O
is O
she O
only O
making O
game O
of O
me O
? O
 O
We O
have O
talked O
of O
Joseph B-PERSON


Sedley I-PERSON
being O
as O
vain O
as O
a O
girl O
. O
Heaven O
help O
us O
! O
the O
girls O
have O
only O
to O
turn O


the O
tables O
, O
and O
say O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
their O
own O
sex O
, O
 O
She O
is O
as O
vain O
as O
a O
man O
, O
 O
and O


they O
will O
have O
perfect O
reason O
. O
The O
bearded O
creatures O
are O
quite O
as O
eager O
for O


praise O
, O
quite O
as O
finikin O
over O
their O
toilets O
, O
quite O
as O
proud O
of O
their O


personal O
advantages O
, O
quite O
as O
conscious O
of O
their O
powers O
of O
fascination O
, O
as O


any O
coquette O
in O
the O
world O
. O


Down O
stairs O
, O
then O
, O
they O
went O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
very O
red O
and O
blushing O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
very O


modest O
, O
and O
holding O
her O
green O
eyes O
downwards O
. O
She O
was O
dressed O
in O
white O
, O
with O


bare O
shoulders O
as O
white O
as O
snow O
— O
the O
picture O
of O
youth O
, O
unprotected O
innocence O
, O


and O
humble O
virgin O
simplicity O
. O
 O
I O
must O
be O
very O
quiet O
, O
 O
thought O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
 O
and O


very O
much O
interested O
about O
India B-GPE
. O
 O


Now O
we O
have O
heard O
how O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
had O
prepared O
a O
fine O
curry O
for O
her O
son O
, O


just O
as O
he O
liked O
it O
, O
and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
dinner O
a O
portion O
of O
this O
dish O
was O


offered O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
What O
is O
it O
? O
 O
said O
she O
, O
turning O
an O
appealing O
look O
to O
Mr. O


Joseph B-PERSON
. O


 O
Capital O
, O
 O
said O
he O
. O
His O
mouth O
was O
full O
of O
it O
; O
his O
face O
quite O
red O
with O
the O


delightful O
exercise O
of O
gobbling O
. O
 O
Mother O
, O
it O
’s O
as O
good O
as O
my O
own O
curries O
in O


India B-GPE
. O
 O


 O
Oh O
, O
I O
must O
try O
some O
, O
if O
it O
is O
an O
Indian B-NORP
dish O
, O
 O
said O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
I O
am O


sure O
everything O
must O
be O
good O
that O
comes O
from O
there O
. O
 O


 O
Give O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
some O
curry O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
 O
said O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
never O
tasted O
the O
dish O
before O
. O


 O
Do O
you O
find O
it O
as O
good O
as O
everything O
else O
from O
India B-GPE
? O
 O
said O
Mr. O


Sedley B-PERSON
. O


 O
Oh O
, O
excellent O

 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
suffering O

with O
the O
cayenne O


pepper O

 O
Try O
a O
chili O

Miss O

 O
said O
Joseph B-PERSON

really O
interested O

 O
A O
chili O
, O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
gasping O
. O
 O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
 O
She O
thought O
a O
chili O
was O


something O
cool O
, O
as O
its O
name O
imported O
, O
and O
was O
served O
with O
some O
. O
 O
How O
fresh O


and O
green O
they O
look O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
and O
put O
one B-CARDINAL
into O
her O
mouth O
. O
It O
was O
hotter O


than O
the O
curry O
; O
flesh O
and O
blood O
could O
bear O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
She O
laid O
down O
her O


fork O

 O
Water O

for O
Heaven O
’s O
sake O
, O
water O
! O
 O
she O
cried O
. O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
burst O
out O


laughing O
( O
he O
was O
a O
coarse O
man O
, O
from O
the B-ORG

where O
they O

 O


The O
paternal O

was O
echoed O
by O
Joseph B-PERSON
, O
who O
thought O
the O
joke O
capital O

The O


ladies O
only O
smiled O
a O
little O

They O
thought O
poor O
Rebecca B-PERSON
suffered O
too O
much O
. O


She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
choke O
old O
Sedley B-PERSON

but O
she O
swallowed O
her O


mortification O
as O
well O
as O
she O
had O
the O
abominable O
curry O
before O
it O
, O
and O
as O
soon O

a O

drew O

looked O

then O
down O

Joe B-PERSON

, O
some O

of O
indisputable O


correctness O

condemn O
the O

as O
immodest O

, O
you O
see O
, O


poor O
dear O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
all O
this O
work O
to O
do O
for O

If O
a O

too O


poor O

keep O
a O

he O

no O

oh O

what O

it O

that O
these O

We O

 O
And O
she O
dropped O
her O

looked O
so O
sad O

piteous O
, O
that O


everybody O
felt O
how O
cruel O
her O

was O
, O
and O
how O
sorry O
they O
would O
be O

 O
Why O
? O
 O
answered O

 O
That O
I O

 O
And O
she O
turned O
away O

Amelia B-PERSON
began O
to O


give O
way O
to O
that O
natural O
infirmity O
of O

, O
we O

George B-PERSON

at O
the O
two B-CARDINAL


young O
women O
with O
a O
touched O
curiosity O
; O
and O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
heaved O
something O


very O
like O
a O
sigh O
out O
of O
his O
big O
chest O
, O
as O
he O
cast O
his O
eyes O
down O
towards O
his O


favourite O
Hessian B-NORP
boots O

 O
Let O
us O
have O
some O
music O

Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
— O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
George B-PERSON
, O
who O
felt O
at O
that O


moment O
an O
extraordinary O
, O
almost O
irresistible O
impulse O
to O
seize O
the O


above O
- O
mentioned O
young O
woman O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
to O
kiss O
her O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O


company O
; O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
if O
I O
should O
say O
that O
they O


fell O
in O
love O
with O
each O
other O
at O
that O
single O
instant O
of O
time O
, O
I O
should O


perhaps O
be O
telling O
an O
untruth O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
young O
people O


had O
been O
bred O
up O
by O
their O
parents O
for O
this O
very O
purpose O
, O
and O
their O
banns O


had O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
been O
read O
in O
their O
respective O
families O
any O
time O
these O
ten B-DATE


years I-DATE
. O
They O
went O
off O
to O
the O
piano O
, O
which O
was O
situated O
, O
as O
pianos O
usually O


are O
, O
in O
the O
back O
drawing O

room O
; O
and O
as O
it O
was O
rather O
dark O
, O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
in O


the O
most O
unaffected O
way O
in O
the O
world O
, O
put O
her O
hand O
into O
Mr. O

, O


of O

could O

a O

 O
There O

no O

 O

 O
Those O

 O


 O
As O
soon O

 O
said O
Joseph B-PERSON

 O
I O

 O
Happy O

 O
With O
this O
Miss O

When O

persons O
get O
together O

and O
talk O
upon O
such O
delicate O


subjects O
as O
the O
present O
, O
a O
great O

of O
confidence O

intimacy O
is O


presently O
established O
between O
them O

There O
is O
no O
need O
of O
giving O
a O
special O


report O
of O
the O
conversation O
, O
which O
now O
took O
place O
between O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON

the O


young O
lady O
; O
for O
the O
conversation O
, O
as O
may O
be O
judged O
from O
the O
foregoing O


specimen O
, O
was O
not O
especially O
witty O
or O
eloquent O
; O
it O
seldom O
is O
in O
private O


societies O
, O
or O
any O
where O
except O
in O
very O
high O

ingenious O

As O


there O
was O
music O
in O
the O
next O
room O
, O
the O
talk O
was O
carried O
on O
, O
of O
course O
, O
in O
a O


low O

tone O
, O
though O
, O
for O
the O

that O
, O
the O

in O
the O


next O

not O

the O

so O

with O

Almost O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
in O
his O
life O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
found O
himself O
talking O
, O


without O
the O
least O
timidity O
or O
hesitation O
, O
to O
a O
person O
of O
the O
other O
sex O
. O
Miss O


Rebecca B-PERSON
asked O
him O
a O
great O
number O
of O
questions O
about O
India B-GPE
, O
which O
gave O
him O
an O


opportunity O
of O
narrating O
many O
interesting O
anecdotes O
about O
that O
country O
and O


himself O
. O
He O
described O
the O
balls O
at O
Government B-ORG
House I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O


they O
kept O
themselves O
cool O
in O
the O
hot O
weather O
, O
with O
punkahs O
, O
tatties O
, O
and O


other O
contrivances O
; O
and O
he O
was O
very O
witty O
regarding O
the O
number O
of O
Scotchmen B-NORP


whom O
Lord O
Minto B-PERSON
, O
the B-ORG
Governor I-ORG
- I-ORG
General I-ORG
, O
patronised O
; O
and O
then O
he O
described O
a O


tiger O
- O
hunt O
; O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
mahout O
of O
his O
elephant O
had O
been O


pulled O
off O
his O
seat O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
infuriated O
animals O
. O
How O
delighted O
Miss O


Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
at O
the O
Government O
balls O
, O
and O
how O
she O
laughed O
at O
the O
stories O
of O


the O
Scotch B-NORP

aides O
- O
de O

camp O
, O

and O
called O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
a O
sad O
wicked O


satirical O
creature O
; O
and O
how O
frightened O
she O
was O
at O
the O
story O
of O
the O
elephant O
! O


 O
For O
your O
mother O

sake O
, O
dear O
Mr. O

 O
she O
said O

 O
for O

of O
all O


your O

never O

 O
He O
had O
never O

once O
at O
a O


tiger O

when O
the O
accident O

when O
he O
was O
half B-CARDINAL


killed O
— O
not O
by O
the O
tiger O
, O
but O
by O
the O
fright O

And O
as O
he O
talked O
on O
, O
he O
grew O


quite O
bold O
, O
and O
actually O
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
ask O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
for O
whom O
she O


was O
knitting O
the O
green O
silk O
purse O
? O
He O
was O
quite O
surprised O

delighted O
at O


his O
own O
graceful O
familiar O
manner O
. O


 O
For O
any O
one O
who O
wants O
a O

 O
replied O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
looking O
at O
him O
in O


the O
most O
gentle O
winning O
way O
. O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
going O
to O
make O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O


eloquent O
speeches O
possible O
, O
and O
had O
begun—O O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
, O
how O
— O
— O
 O
when O
some O


song O
which O
was O
performed O
in O
the O
other O
room O
came O
to O
an O
end O
, O
and O
caused O
him O
to O


hear O
his O
own O
voice O
so O
distinctly O
that O
he O
stopped O
, O
blushed O
, O
and O
blew O
his O
nose O


in O
great O
agitation O
. O


 O
Did O
you O
ever O
hear O
anything O
like O
your O
brother O

eloquence O
? O
 O
whispered O
Mr. O


Osborne B-PERSON
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
 O
Why O
, O
your O
friend O
has O
worked O
miracles O
. O
 O


 O
The O
more O
the O
better O
, O
 O
said O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
; O
who O
, O
like O
almost O
all O
women O
who O
are O


worth O
a O
pin O
, O
was O
a O

in O
her O
heart O

and O
would O
have O
been O
delighted O


that O
Joseph B-PERSON
should O
carry O
back O
a O
wife O
to O
India B-GPE

She O
had O
, O
too O
, O
in O
the O
course O


of O
this B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
’ I-DATE
constant O
intercourse O
, O
warmed O
into O
a O
most O
tender O
friendship O


for O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
and O
discovered O
a B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
of O
virtues O
and O
amiable O
qualities O
in O


her O
which O
she O
had O
not O
perceived O
when O
they O
were O
at O
Chiswick B-GPE
together O
. O
For O
the O


affection O
of O
young O
ladies O
is O
of O
as O
rapid O
growth O
as O
Jack B-PERSON
’s O
beanstalk O
, O
and O


reaches O
up O
to O
the O
sky O
in O
a B-TIME

It O
is O
no O
blame O
to O
them O
that O
after O
marriage O


this O

Sehnsucht B-PERSON

subsides O
. O
It O
is O
what O
sentimentalists O

who O
deal O
in O

very O

big O
words O
, O
call O
a O
yearning O
after O
the O
Ideal B-ORG
, O
and O


simply O
means O
that O
women O
are O
commonly O
not O
satisfied O
until O
they O
have O
husbands O


and O
children O
on O
whom O
they O
may O
centre O

of O

or O
having O
stayed O
long O
enough O
in O


the O

it O
now O
appeared O
proper O
to O
Miss O

to O
ask O
her O


friend O
to O
sing O

 O
You O
would O
not O

 O
she O
said O
to O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON


( O
though O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
telling O

, O
 O
had O
you O
heard O
Rebecca B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
. O
 O


 O
I O
give O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
warning O
, O
though O
, O
 O
said O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
 O
that O
, O
right O

, O
I O


consider O
Miss O

Sedley I-PERSON
the O
first B-ORDINAL
singer O
in O

. O
 O


 O
You O
shall O
hear O
, O
 O
said O
Amelia B-PERSON
; O
and O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
was O
actually O
polite O
enough O


to O
carry O
the O
candles O
to O
the O
piano O
. O
Osborne B-PERSON
hinted O
that O
he O
should O
like O
quite O


as O
well O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
dark O
; O
but O
Miss B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
declined O
to O
bear O
him O


company O
any O
farther O
, O
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
accordingly O
followed O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON


sang O
far O
better O
than O
her O
friend O
( O
though O
of O
course O
Osborne B-PERSON
was O
free O
to O
keep O


his O
opinion O
) O
and O
exerted O
herself O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
the O
wonder O


of O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
never O
known O
her O
perform O
so O
well O
. O
She O
sang O
a O
French B-NORP
song O
, O


which O
Joseph B-PERSON
did O
not O
understand O
in O
the O
least O
, O
and O
which O
George B-PERSON
confessed O
he O


did O
not O
understand O
, O
and O
then O
a O
number O
of O
those O
simple O
ballads O
which O
were O
the O

forty B-DATE

Mr. O

It O
was O
a O

Some O

it O

that O
Mr. O

on O

in O

lying O


under O

he O

— O
apart O

who O
were O
pursuing O
their O
various O
sports O
— O
quite O
lonely O

and O
almost O
happy O

If O

would O
but O
leave O
children O

themselves O
; O
if O

those O

are O

 O

his O

It O
would O
me O
ungentlemanlike O
( O
in O

Perhaps O
Dobbin B-PERSON

foolish O
soul O
revolted O
against O

of O

; O
or O
perhaps O
he O
had O
a O
hankering O

longed O

three B-CARDINAL
preceding O
occasions O
, O


without O
ever O
allowing O
his O
enemy O
to O
strike O
, O
Figs B-PERSON
now O
determined O
that O
he O
would O


commence O
the O
engagement O
by O
a O
charge O
on O
his O
own O
part O
; O
and O
accordingly O
, O
being O


a O
left O

man O
, O
brought O
that O
arm O
into O
action O
, O
and O
hit O
out O
a O

times O
with O
all O
his O

— O
once O
at O
Mr. O
Cuff B-PERSON

and O
once O
on O
his O


beautiful O
Roman B-NORP
nose O

Cuff O
went O
down O
this O
time O
, O
to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
the O
assembly O
. O
 O
Well O
hit O
, O


by O
Jove B-PERSON
, O
 O
says O
little O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
connoisseur O
, O
clapping O
his O


man O
on O
the O
back O
. O
 O
Give O
it O
him O
with O
the O

my O

made O
terrific O
play O
during O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
combat O
. O
Cuff B-PERSON
went O


down O
every O
time O
. O
At O
the O
sixth B-ORDINAL
round O
, O
there O
were O
almost O
as O
many O
fellows O


shouting O
out O
, O
 O
Go O
it O
, O
Figs B-PERSON
, O
 O
as O
there O
were O

exclaiming O
, O
 O
Go O
it O
, O
Cuff B-PERSON
. O
 O


At O
the O
twelfth B-ORDINAL
round O
the O
latter O
champion O
was O
all O
aboard O
, O
as O
the O
saying O
is O
, O


and O
had O
lost O
all O
presence O
of O
mind O
and O
power O
of O
attack O
or O
defence O
. O
Figs B-PERSON
, O
on O


the O
contrary O
, O
was O
as O
calm O
as O
a O
Quaker B-ORG
. O
His O
face O
being O
quite O
pale O
, O
his O
eyes O


shining O
open O
, O
and O
a O
great O
cut O
on O
his O
under O
lip O
bleeding O
profusely O
, O
gave O
this O


young O
fellow O
a O
fierce O
and O
ghastly O
air O
, O
which O
perhaps O
struck O
terror O
into O
many O


spectators O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
his O
intrepid O
adversary O
prepared O
to O
close O
for O
the O


thirteenth B-ORDINAL
time O
. O


If O
I O
had O
the O
pen O
of O
a O

or O
a O

, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
describe O


this O
combat O
properly O
. O
It O
was O
the O
last O
charge O
of O
the O
Guard—(that B-PERSON
is O
, O

it O


would O

have O
been O
, O
only O
Waterloo B-GPE

taken O
place)—it O
was O

breasting O
the O

, O
bristling O
with O
ten B-CARDINAL


thousand I-CARDINAL
bayonets O
, O
and O
crowned O
with O
twenty B-CARDINAL
eagles O
— O
it O
was O
the O
shout O
of O
the O


beef O

eating O
British B-NORP
, O
as O
leaping O
down O
the O
hill O
they O
rushed O
to O
hug O
the O
enemy O


in O
the O
savage O
arms O
of O
battle O
— O
in O
other O
words O
, O
Cuff B-PERSON
, O
coming O
up O
full O
of O
pluck O
, O


but O
quite O
reeling O

groggy O
, O
the O

put O
in O
his O

as O
usual O
on O


his O
adversary O

and O
sent O
him O
down O
for O
the O
last O
time O
. O


 O
I O
think O

that O

will O
do O
for O
him O
, O
 O
Figs B-PERSON
said O

as O
his O

dropped O


as O
neatly O
on O
the O

as O
I O
have O
seen O
Jack B-PERSON

plump O
into O
the O

at O

and O
the O
fact O

, O
when O

Mr. O

Cuff I-PERSON
was O


not O
able O
, O
or O
did O
not O
choose O
, O
to O
stand O
up O
again O

And O
now O
all O
the O

set O
up O
such O
a O
shout O
for O
Figs B-PERSON
as O
would O
have O
made O
you O


think O
he O
had O
been O
their O
darling O
champion O
through O
the O
whole O
battle O
; O
and O
as O


absolutely O
brought O
Dr. O

out O
of O
his O
study O
, O
curious O
to O
know O
the O
cause O


of O
the O
uproar O
. O
He O
threatened O
to O
flog O
Figs B-PERSON
violently O
, O
of O
course O
; O
but O
Cuff B-PERSON
, O


who O
had O
come O
to O
himself O
by O
this O
time O
, O
and O
was O
washing O
his O

, O
stood O
up O


and O
said O
, O
 O
It O
’s O
my O
fault O
, O
sir O
— O
not O
Figs’—not O
Dobbin B-PERSON

. O
I O
was O
bullying O
a O


little O

and O
he O
served O
me O
right O
. O
 O
By O
which O
magnanimous O
speech O
he O
not O
only O


saved O
his O
conqueror O
a O
whipping O
, O
but O
got O
back O
all O
his O
ascendency O
over O
the O

which O
his O
defeat O
had O
nearly O
cost O
him O

in O

caught O
Miss O

eye O
fixed O
keenly O
upon O
him O

at O
which O
he O
blushed O
a O
little O

Rebecca B-PERSON

in O
her O

 O
Ah O

mon O
beau O
Monsieur O

I O
think O
I O

your O

That O
evening O
, O
when O
Amelia B-PERSON
came O
tripping O
into O
the O
drawing O

room O
in O
a O
white O


muslin B-PERSON
frock I-PERSON
, O
prepared O
for O
conquest O
at O
Vauxhall B-ORG

singing O
like O
a O
lark O
, O
and O
as O


fresh O
as O
a O
rose O
— O
a O
very O
tall O
ungainly O
gentleman O
, O
with O
large O
hands O

feet O

and O
large O
ears O
, O
set O
off O
by O
a O
closely O
cropped O
head O
of O
black O
hair O

and O
in O
the O


hideous O
military O
frogged O
coat O
and O
cockedhat O
of O
those O
times O
, O
advanced O
to O
meet O


her O
, O
and O
made O
her O
one O
of O
the O
clumsiest O
bows O
that O
was O
ever O
performed O
by O
a O


mortal O

This O
was O
no O
other O
than O
Captain O
William B-PERSON

of O
His O
Majesty O

the O


fortune O

whilst O
so O
many O
of O
his O


gallant O

were O
reaping O
glory O
in O
the O
Peninsula B-LOC

He O
had O
arrived O
with O
a O
knock O
so O
very O
timid O

quiet O
, O
that O
it O
was O
inaudible O


to O
the O
ladies O
upstairs O
: O
otherwise O
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
Miss O

would O
never O


have O
been O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
come O
singing O
into O
the O
room O
As O
it O
was O
, O
the O
sweet O


fresh O
little O
voice O
went O
right O
into O
the O
Captain O

heart O

nestled O
there O

When O
she O
held O
out O
her O

him O

before O
he O
enveloped O
it O
in O
his O

paused O

thought—Well B-PERSON

it O

you O
the O
little O

remember O
in O

the O

I O
upset O

Are O
you O
the O

what O

 O
All O
this O

before O

took O

these O

sat O
down O

away O

Miss O

kindled O
with O
this O
exciting O
talk O

but O
Miss O

trembled O

grew O
quite O
faint O
as O
she O
heard O
it O

Mr. O

Vauxhall B-ORG


I O
KNOW O
that O
the O

is O
a O
very O
mild O
one O
( O
although O
there O
are O
some O


terrific O
chapters O
coming O
presently O
) O
, O
and O
must O
beg O
the O
good O

to O


remember O

that O
we O

The O


argument O
stands O
thus O
— O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
in O
love O
with O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
has O
asked O
an O
old O
friend O


to O
dinner O
and O
to O
Vauxhall B-ORG
— O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
is O
in O
love O
with O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
Will O
he O
marry O


her O
? O
That O
is O
the O
great O
subject O
now O
in O
hand O
. O


We O
might O
have O
treated O
this O
subject O
in O
the O
genteel O
, O
or O
in O
the O
romantic O
, O
or O


in O
the O
facetious O
manner O
. O
Suppose O
we O
had O
laid O
the O
scene O
in O
Grosvenor B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O


with O
the O
very O
same O
adventures O
— O
would O
not O
some O
people O
have O
listened O
? O
Suppose O


we O
had O
shown O
how O
Lord O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
fell O
in O
love O
, O
and O
the O
Marquis B-PERSON
of O
Osborne B-PERSON


became O
attached O
to O
Lady B-PERSON
Amelia I-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
full O
consent O
of O
the O
Duke O
, O
her O
noble O


father O
: O
or O
instead O
of O
the O
supremely O
genteel O
, O
suppose O
we O
had O
resorted O
to O
the O


entirely O
low O
, O
and O
described O
what O
was O
going O
on O
in O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O
kitchen;—how O


black O
Sambo B-PERSON
was O
in O
love O
with O
the O
cook O
( O
as O
indeed O
he O
was O
) O
, O
and O
how O
he O
fought O


a O
battle O
with O
the O
coachman O
in O
her O
behalf O
; O
how O
the O
knife O
- O
boy O
was O
caught O


stealing O
a O
cold O
shoulder O
of O
mutton O
, O
and O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON

new O

femme O
de O


chambre O

refused O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
without O
a O
wax O
candle O
; O
such O
incidents O


might O
be O
made O
to O
provoke O
much O
delightful O
laughter O
, O
and O
be O
supposed O
to O


represent O
scenes O
of O
 O
life O
. O
 O
Or O
if O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
we O
had O
taken O
a O
fancy O
for O


the O
terrible O
, O
and O
made O
the O
lover O
of O
the O
new O

femme O

a O


professional O
burglar O

black O

the O
feet O
of O
his O

carries O
off O
Amelia B-PERSON
in O
her O


night O
- O
dress O
, O
not O
to O
be O
let O
loose O
again O
till O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
volume O
, O
we O
should O


easily O
have O
constructed O
a O
tale O
of O
thrilling O
interest O
, O
through O
the O
fiery O


chapters O
of O
which O
the O
reader O
should O
hurry O
, O
panting O
. O
But O
my O
readers O
must O
hope O


for O
no O
such O
romance O
, O
only O
a O
homely O
story O
, O
and O
must O
be O
content O
with O
a O
chapter O


about O
Vauxhall B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
so O
short O
that O
it O
scarce O
deserves O
to O
be O
called O
a O


chapter O
at O
all O
. O
And O
yet O
it O
is O
a O
chapter O
, O
and O
a O
very O
important O
one O
too O
. O
Are O


not O
there O
little O
chapters O
in O
everybody O
’s O
life O
, O
that O
seem O
to O
be O
nothing O
, O
and O


yet O
affect O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
history O
? O


Let O
us O
then O
step O
into O
the O
coach O
with O
the O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
party O
, O
and O
be O
off O


to O
the O
Gardens O
. O
There O
is O
barely O
room O
between O
Jos B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
, O
who O
are O
on O


the O
front O
seat O
. O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
sitting O
bodkin O
opposite O
, O
between O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON


and O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O


Every O
soul O
in O
the O
coach O
agreed O
, O
that O
on O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
Jos B-PERSON
would O
propose O
to O


make O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp I-PERSON
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
. O
The O
parents O
at O
home O
had O
acquiesced O
in O
the O


arrangement O
, O
though O
, O
between O
ourselves O
, O
old O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
had O
a O
feeling O
very O


much O
akin O
to O
contempt O
for O
his O
son O
. O
He O
said O
he O
was O
vain O
, O
selfish O
, O
lazy O
, O
and O


effeminate O
. O
He O
could O
not O
endure O
his O
airs O
as O
a O
man O
of O
fashion O
, O
and O
laughed O


heartily O
at O
his O
pompous O
braggadocio O
stories O
. O
 O
I O
shall O
leave O
the O
fellow O
half B-CARDINAL


my O
property O
, O
 O
he O
said O
; O
 O
and O
he O
will O
have O
, O
besides O
, O
plenty O
of O
his O
own O
; O
but O
as O


I O
am O
perfectly O
sure O
that O
if O
you O
, O
and O
I O
, O
and O
his O
sister O
were O
to O
die O


to O
- O
morrow B-DATE
, O
he O
would O
say O
‘ O
Good O
Gad B-PERSON
! O
’ O
and O
eat O
his O
dinner O
just O
as O
well O
as O


usual O
, O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
make O
myself O
anxious O
about O
him O
. O
Let O
him O
marry O
whom O


he O
likes O
. O
It O
’s O
no O
affair O
of O
mine O
. O
 O


Amelia B-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
as O
became O
a O
young O
woman O
of O
her O
prudence O
and O


temperament O
, O
was O
quite O
enthusiastic O
for O
the O
match O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
Jos B-PERSON
had O


been O
on O
the O
point O
of O
saying O
something O
very O
important O
to O
her O
, O
to O
which O
she O


was O
most O
willing O
to O
lend O
an O
ear O
, O
but O
the O
fat O
fellow O
could O
not O
be O
brought O
to O


unbosom O
himself O
of O
his O
great O
secret O
, O
and O
very O
much O
to O
his O
sister O
’s O


disappointment O
he O
only O
rid O
himself O
of O
a O
large O
sigh O
and O
turned O
away O
. O


This O
mystery O
served O
to O
keep O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
gentle O
bosom O
in O
a O
perpetual O
flutter O
of O


excitement O
. O
If O
she O
did O
not O
speak O
with O
Rebecca B-PERSON
on O
the O
tender O
subject O
, O
she O


compensated O
herself O
with O
long O
and O
intimate O
conversations O
with O
Mrs. O


Blenkinsop B-PERSON
, O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
who O
dropped O
some O
hints O
to O
the O
lady’s O
- O
maid O
, O
who O


may O
have O
cursorily O
mentioned O
the O
matter O
to O
the O
cook O
, O
who O
carried O
the O
news O
, O
I O


have O
no O
doubt O
, O
to O
all O
the O
tradesmen O
, O
so O
that O
Mr. O
Jos B-PERSON
’s O
marriage O
was O
now O


talked O
of O
by O
a O
very O
considerable O
number O
of O
persons O
in O
the B-FAC
Russell I-FAC
Square I-FAC


world O
. O


It O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O
opinion O
that O
her O
son O
would O
demean O
himself O


by O
a O
marriage O
with O
an O
artist O
’s O
daughter O
. O
 O
But O
, O
lor O
’ O
, O
Ma’am O
, O
 O
ejaculated O
Mrs. O


Blenkinsop B-PERSON
, O
 O
we O
was O
only O
grocers O
when O
we O
married O
Mr. O
S. B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
a O


stock O
- O
broker O
’s O
clerk O
, O
and O
we O
had O
n’t O
five B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
among O
us O
, O
and O
we O
’re O


rich O
enough O
now O
. O
 O
And O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
entirely O
of O
this O
opinion O
, O
to O
which O
, O


gradually O
, O
the O
good O
- O
natured O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
brought O
. O


Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
neutral O
. O
 O
Let O
Jos B-PERSON
marry O
whom O
he O
likes O
, O
 O
he O
said O
; O
 O
it O
’s O
no O


affair O
of O
mine O
. O
This O
girl O
has O
no O
fortune O
; O
no O
more O
had O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
. O
She O
seems O


good O
- O
humoured O
and O
clever O
, O
and O
will O
keep O
him O
in O
order O
, O
perhaps O
. O
Better O
she O
, O


my O
dear O
, O
than O
a O
black O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
and O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
of O
mahogany O


grandchildren O
. O
 O


So O
that O
everything O
seemed O
to O
smile O
upon O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
fortunes O
. O
She O
took O
Jos B-PERSON
’s O


arm O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
on O
going O
to O
dinner O
; O
she O
had O
sate O
by O
him O
on O
the O


box O
of O
his O
open O
carriage O
( O
a O
most O
tremendous O
 O

 O
he O
was O

as O

sat O
there O

and O
though O
nobody O
said O
a O
word O
on O
the O


subject O
of O
the O
marriage O
, O
everybody O
seemed O
to O
understand O
it O
. O
All O
she O
wanted O


was O
the O
proposal O
, O
and O
ah O
! O
how O
Rebecca B-PERSON
now O
felt O
the O
want O
of O
a O
mother!—a O
dear O
, O


tender O
mother O
, O
who O
would O
have O
managed O
the O
business O
in O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
and O
, O
in O


the O
course O
of O
a O
little O
delicate O
confidential O
conversation O
, O
would O
have O


extracted O
the O
interesting O
avowal O
from O
the O
bashful O
lips O
of O
the O
young O
man O
! O


Such O
was O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
as O
the O
carriage O
crossed O


Westminster B-FAC
- I-FAC
bridge I-FAC
. O


The O
party O
was O
landed O
at O
the B-FAC
Royal I-FAC
Gardens I-FAC
in O
due O
time O
. O
As O
the O
majestic O
Jos B-GPE


stepped O
out O
of O
the O
creaking O
vehicle O
the O
crowd O
gave O
a O
cheer O
for O
the O
fat O


gentleman O
, O
who O
blushed O
and O
looked O
very O
big O
and O
mighty O
, O
as O
he O
walked O
away O


with O
Rebecca B-PERSON
under O
his O
arm O
. O
George B-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
took O
charge O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
She O


looked O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
rosetree O
in O
sunshine O
. O


 O
I O
say O
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
 O
says O
George B-PERSON
, O
 O
just O
look O
to O
the O
shawls O
and O
things O
, O
there O
’s O


a O
good O
fellow O
. O
 O
And O
so O
while O
he O
paired O
off O
with O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
and O
Jos B-PERSON


squeezed O
through O
the O
gate O
into O
the O
gardens O
with O
Rebecca B-PERSON
at O
his O
side O
, O
honest O


Dobbin B-PERSON
contented O
himself O
by O
giving O
an O
arm O
to O
the O
shawls O
, O
and O
by O
paying O
at O


the O
door O
for O
the O
whole O
party O
. O


He O
walked O
very O
modestly O
behind O
them O
. O
He O
was O
not O
willing O
to O
spoil O
sport O
. O


About O
Rebecca B-PERSON
and O
Jos B-PERSON
he O
did O
not O
care O
a O
fig O
. O
But O
he O
thought O
Amelia B-PERSON
worthy O


even O
of O
the O
brilliant O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
, O
and O
as O
he O
saw O
that O
good O
- O
looking O
couple O


threading O
the O
walks O
to O
the O
girl O
’s O
delight O
and O
wonder O
, O
he O
watched O
her O
artless O


happiness O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
fatherly O
pleasure O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
would O


have O
liked O
to O
have O
something O
on O
his O
own O
arm O
besides O
a O
shawl O
( O
the O
people O


laughed O
at O
seeing O
the O
gawky O
young O
officer O
carrying O
this O
female O
burthen O
): O
but O


William B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON
was O
very O
little O
addicted O
to O
selfish O
calculation O
at O
all O
; O
and O


so O
long O
as O
his O
friend O
was O
enjoying O
himself O
, O
how O
should O
he O
be O
discontented O
? O


And O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
of O
all O
the O
delights O
of O
the O
Gardens O
; O
of O
the B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL


thousand I-CARDINAL

extra O

lamps O
, O
which O
were O
always O
lighted O
; O
the O
fiddlers O
in O


cocked O
hats O
, O
who O
played O
ravishing O
melodies O
under O
the O
gilded O
cockle O
- O
shell O
in O


the O
midst O
of O
the O
gardens O
; O
the O
singers O
, O
both O
of O
comic O
and O
sentimental O


ballads O
, O
who O
charmed O
the O
ears O
there O
; O
the O
country O
dances O
, O
formed O
by O
bouncing O


cockneys O
and O
cockneyesses O
, O
and O
executed O
amidst O
jumping O
, O
thumping O
, O
and O


laughter O
; O
the O
signal O
which O
announced O
that O
Madame O
Saqui O
was O
about O
to O
mount O


skyward O
on O
a O
slack O

rope O
ascending O
to O
the O
stars O
; O
the O
hermit O
that O
always O
sat O


in O
the O
illuminated O
hermitage O
; O
the O
dark O
walks O
, O
so O
favourable O
to O
the O


interviews O
of O
young O
lovers O
; O
the O
pots O
of O
stout O
handed O
about O
by O
the O
people O
in O


the O
shabby O
old O
liveries O
; O
and O
the O
twinkling O
boxes O
, O
in O
which O
the O
happy O


feasters O
made O
- O
believe O
to O
eat O
slices O
of O
almost O
invisible O
ham;—of O
all O
these O


things O
, O
and O
of O
the O
gentle O
Simpson B-PERSON
, O
that O
kind O
smiling O
idiot O

who O
, O
I O

, O


presided O
even O
then O
over O
the O
place O
— O
Captain O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON
did O
not O
take O
the O


slightest O
notice O

He O
carried O
about O
Amelia B-PERSON

white O

having O
attended O
under O


the O

Dobbin B-PERSON
tried O
to O
hum O
it O
as O
he O
walked O
away O
, O
and O
found O
he O


was O
humming O
— O
the O
tune O
which O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
sang O
on O
the O
stairs O
, O
as O
she O
came O


down O
to O
dinner O
. O


He O
burst O
out O
laughing O
at O
himself O
; O
for O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
he O
could O
sing O
no O
better O


than O
an O
owl O
. O


It O
is O
to O
be O
understood O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
that O
our O
young O
people O
, O
being O


in O
parties O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
and O
two O
, O
made O
the O
most O
solemn O
promises O
to O
keep O
together O


during O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
separated O
in O
ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
afterwards O
. O
Parties O
at O


Vauxhall B-ORG
always O
did O
separate O
, O
but O
’ O
twas O
only O
to O
meet O
again O
at O
supper O
- O
time O
, O


when O
they O
could O
talk O
of O
their O
mutual O
adventures O
in O
the O
interval O
. O


What O
were O
the O
adventures O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
? O
That O
is O
a O
secret O
. O


But O
be O
sure O
of O
this O
— O
they O
were O
perfectly O
happy O
, O
and O
correct O
in O
their O


behaviour O
; O
and O
as O
they O
had O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
being O
together O
any O
time O


these B-DATE
fifteen I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
their O

offered O
no O
particular O


novelty O
. O


But O
when O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
Sharp I-PERSON
and O
her O
stout O
companion O
lost O
themselves O
in O
a O


solitary O
walk O
, O
in O
which O
there O
were O
not O
above O
five B-CARDINAL
score O
more O
of O
couples O


similarly O
straying O
, O
they O
both O
felt O
that O
the O
situation O
was O
extremely O
tender O


and O
critical O
, O
and O
now O
or O
never O
was O
the O
moment O
, O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
thought O
, O
to O


provoke O
that O
declaration O
which O
was O
trembling O
on O
the O
timid O
lips O
of O
Mr. O


Sedley B-PERSON
. O
They O
had O
previously O
been O
to O
the O
panorama O
of O
Moscow B-GPE
, O
where O
a O
rude O


fellow O
, O
treading O
on O
Miss O
Saharp B-PERSON
’s O
foot O
, O
caused O
her O
to O
fall O
back O
with O
a O


little O
shriek O
into O
the O
arms O
of O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
little O
incident O


increased O
the O
tenderness O
and O
confidence O
of O
that O
gentleman O
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O


that O
he O
told O
her O
several O
of O
his O
favourite O
Indian B-NORP
stories O
over O
again O
for O
, O
at O


least O
, O
the O
sixth B-ORDINAL
time O
. O


 O
How O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
India B-GPE
! O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O


 O
Should O

you O
? O
 O
said O
Joseph B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
most O
killing O
tenderness O
; O
and O
was O


no O
doubt O
about O
to O
follow O
up O
this O
artful O
interrogatory O
by O
a O
question O
still O


more O
tender O
( O
for O
he O
puffed O
and O
panted O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
, O


which O
was O
placed O
near O
his O
heart O
, O
could O
count O
the O
feverish O
pulsations O
of O
that O


organ O
) O
, O
when O
, O
oh O
, O
provoking O
! O
the O
bell O
rang O
for O
the O
fireworks O
, O
and O
, O
a O
great O


scuffling O
and O
running O
taking O
place O
, O
these O
interesting O
lovers O
were O
obliged O
to O


follow O
in O
the O
stream O
of O
people O
. O


Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
some O
thoughts O
of O
joining O
the O
party O
at O
supper O
: O
as O
, O
in O


truth O
, O
he O
found O
the O
Vauxhall B-ORG
amusements O
not O
particularly O
lively O
— O
but O
he O


paraded O
twice O
before O
the O
box O
where O
the O
now O
united O
couples O
were O
met O
, O
and O


nobody O
took O
any O
notice O
of O
him O
. O
Covers O
were O
laid O
for O
four B-CARDINAL
. O
The O
mated O
pairs O


were O
prattling O
away O
quite O
happily O
, O
and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
knew O
he O
was O
as O
clean O
forgotten O


as O
if O
he O
had O
never O
existed O
in O
this O
world O
. O


 O
I O
should O
only O
be O

de O
trop O
, O
 O

said O
the O
Captain O
, O
looking O
at O
them O


rather O
wistfully O
. O
 O
I O
’d O
best O
go O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
hermit,—and O
so O
he O
strolled O


off O
out O
of O
the O
hum O
of O
men O
, O
and O
noise O
and O
clatter O
of O
the O
banquet O
, O
into O
the O


dark O
walk O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
which O
lived O
that O
well O
- O
known O
pasteboard O
Solitary B-ORG
. O
It O


was O
n’t O
very O
good O
fun O
for O
Dobbin B-PERSON
— O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
be O
alone O
at O
Vauxhall B-ORG
, O
I O
have O


found O
, O
from O
my O
own O
experience O
, O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dismal O
sports O
ever O


entered O
into O
by O
a O
bachelor O
. O


The O
two B-CARDINAL
couples O
were O
perfectly O
happy O
then O
in O
their O
box O
: O
where O
the O
most O


delightful O
and O
intimate O
conversation O
took O
place O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
was O
in O
his O
glory O
, O


ordering O
about O
the O
waiters O
with O
great O
majesty O
. O
He O
made O
the O
salad O
; O
and O


uncorked O
the O
Champagne B-ORG
; O
and O
carved O
the O
chickens O
; O
and O
ate O
and O
drank O
the O


greater O
part O
of O
the O
refreshments O
on O
the O
tables O
. O
Finally O
, O
he O
insisted O
upon O


having O
a O
bowl O
of O
rack O
punch O
; O
everybody O
had O
rack O
punch O
at O
Vauxhall B-ORG
. O
 O
Waiter B-PERSON
, O


rack O
punch O
. O
 O


That O
bowl O
of O
rack O
punch O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
this O
history O
. O
And O
why O
not O
a O


bowl O
of O
rack O
punch O
as O
well O
as O
any O
other O
cause O
? O
Was O
not O
a O
bowl O
of O
prussic O


acid O
the O
cause O
of O
Fair B-ORG
Rosamond I-ORG
’s I-ORG
retiring O
from O
the O
world O
? O
Was O
not O
a O
bowl O
of O


wine O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
demise O
of O
Alexander B-ORG
the I-ORG
Great I-ORG
, O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
does O
not O


Dr. O
Lempriere B-PERSON
say O
so?—so O
did O
this O
bowl O
of O
rack O
punch O
influence O
the O
fates O
of O


all O
the O
principal O
characters O
in O
this O
 O
Novel O
without O
a O
Hero B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
 O
which O
we O
are O


now O
relating O
. O
It O
influenced O
their O
life O
, O
although O
most O
of O
them O
did O
not O
taste O


a O
drop O
of O
it O
. O


The O
young O
ladies O
did O
not O
drink O
it O
; O
Osborne B-PERSON
did O
not O
like O
it O
; O
and O
the O


consequence O
was O
that O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
that O
fat O

gourmand O
, O

drank O
up O
the O
whole O


contents O
of O
the O
bowl O
; O
and O
the O
consequence O
of O
his O
drinking O
up O
the O
whole O


contents O
of O
the O
bowl O
was O
, O
a O
liveliness O
which O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
astonishing O
, O
and O


then O
became O
almost O
painful O
; O
for O
he O
talked O
and O
laughed O
so O
loud O
as O
to O
bring O


scores O
of O
listeners O
round O
the O
box O
, O
much O
to O
the O
confusion O
of O
the O
innocent O


party O
within O
it O
; O
and O
, O
volunteering O
to O
sing O
a O
song O
( O
which O
he O
did O
in O
that O


maudlin O
high O
key O
peculiar O
to O
gentlemen O
in O
an O
inebriated O
state O
) O
, O
he O
almost O


drew O
away O
the O
audience O
who O
were O
gathered O
round O
the O
musicians O
in O
the O
gilt O


scollop O
- O
shell O
, O
and O
received O
from O
his O
hearers O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
applause O

Jos B-PERSON
continued O


to O

to O

to O
sing O
; O
and O
, O
winking O
and O
waving O
his O

gracefully O
to O
his O
audience O
, O
challenged O
all O

any O

come O
in O

take O
a O

Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
was O
just O
on O
the O
point O
of O
knocking O
down O
a O
gentleman O
in O


top O
- O
boots O
, O
who O
proposed O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
this O
invitation O
, O
and O
a O


commotion O
seemed O
to O
be O
inevitable O
, O
when O
by O
the O
greatest O
good O
luck O
a O


gentleman O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
been O
walking O
about O
the O
gardens O
, O


stepped O
up O
to O
the O
box O
. O
 O
Be O
off O
, O
you O
fools O
! O
 O
said O
this O
gentleman O
— O
shouldering O


off O
a O
great O
number O
of O
the O
crowd O
, O
who O
vanished O
presently O
before O
his O
cocked O


hat O
and O
fierce O
appearance O
— O
and O
he O
entered O
the O
box O
in O
a O
most O
agitated O


state O
. O


 O
Good O
Heavens O
! O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
where O

have O

you O
been O
? O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
, O
seizing O


the O
white O
cashmere O
shawl O
from O
his O
friend O
’s O
arm O
, O
and O
huddling O
up O
Amelia B-PERSON

it.—Make O

of O
Jos B-PERSON
here O
, O
whilst O
I O
take O
the O

to O
the O

. O
 O


Jos B-PERSON
was O
for O
rising O
to O
interfere O
— O
but O
a O
single O
push O
from O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
finger O


sent O
him O
puffing O
back O
into O
his O
seat O

as O
they O
retreated O

and O
hiccupped O
out O
 O
Bless O

Bless O

 O
Then O
, O
seizing O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O


hand O
, O
and O
weeping O
in O
the O
most O
pitiful O
way O
, O
he O
confided O
to O
that O
gentleman O
the O


secret O
of O
his O
loves O
. O
He O
adored O
that O
girl O
who O
had O
just O
gone O
out O
; O
he O
had O


broken O
her O
heart O
, O
he O
knew O
he O
had O
, O
by O
his O
conduct O
; O
he O
would O
marry O
her O
next O


morning B-TIME
at O
St. B-GPE
George I-GPE
’s I-GPE
, O
Hanover B-FAC
Square I-FAC
; O
he O
’d O
knock O
up O
the O
Archbishop O
of O


Canterbury B-PERSON
at O
Lambeth O
: O
he O
would O
, O
by O
Jove B-PERSON
! O
and O
have O
him O
in O
readiness O
; O
and O
, O


acting O
on O
this O
hint O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
shrewdly O
induced O
him O
to O
leave O
the O


gardens O
and O
hasten O
to O
Lambeth B-FAC
Palace I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
when O
once O
out O

, O


easily O
conveyed O
Mr. O

safely O

George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
conducted O
the O

home O

and O
when O
the O
door O
was O


closed O
upon O
him O
, O
and O
as O
he O
walked O
across O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
laughed O
so O
as O
to O


astonish O
the O
watchman O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON
looked O
very O
ruefully O
at O
her O
friend O
, O
as O
they O


went O
up O

, O
and O
kissed O
her O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
without O
any O
more O


talking O
. O


 O
He O
must O
propose O
to O
- O
morrow B-DATE
, O
 O
thought O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
He O
called O
me O
his O
soul O

darling O
, O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
; O
he O
squeezed O
my O
hand O
in O
Amelia B-PERSON

presence O
. O
He O
must O


propose O
to O
- O
morrow B-DATE

 O


And O
so O
thought O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
too O
. O
And O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
dress O
she O
was O

of O

 O
Mr. O

uncommon O

last O

they O
relapsed O

 O


 O
You O

did O

have O

, O


 O

my O

 O


 O
I O
believe O
I O

very O
terrible O
, O
when O
I O
’m O
roused O
, O
 O
ejaculated O
Jos B-PERSON
from O
the O


sofa O
, O
and O
made O
a O
grimace O
so O
dreary O

ludicrous O
, O
that O
the O
Captain O

politeness O
could O
restrain O
him O
no O
longer O
and O
he O
and O
Osborne B-PERSON
fired O
off O
a O


ringing O
volley O
of O

Osborne B-PERSON
pursued O
his O
advantage O
pitilessly O

He O
thought O

He O
had O


been O
revolving O
in O
his O
mind O
the O
marriage O

Rebecca B-PERSON

was O
not O

 O
You O

Why O

you O

you O

You O
were O
maudlin O

Do O

 O


 O
A O

 O
Jos B-PERSON

 O
A O

your O

? O
 O
And O
this O
ruthless O
young O


fellow O
, O
seizing O
hold O
of O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
, O
acted O
over O
the O
scene O
, O
to O
the O
horror O


of O
the O
original O
performer O
, O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
good O
- O
natured O
entreaties O


to O
him O
to O
have O
mercy O
. O


 O
Why O
should O
I O
spare O
him O
? O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
friend O

remonstrances O
, O
when O


they O
quitted O
the O
invalid O
, O
leaving O
him O
under O
the O
hands O
of O
Doctor O

. O


 O
What O
the O
deuce O
right O
has O
he O
to O
give O
himself O
his O
patronizing O
airs O
, O
and O
make O


fools O
of O
us O
at O
Vauxhall B-ORG
? O
Who O
’s O
this O
little O
school O

girl O
that O
is O
ogling O

making O
love O
to O
him O
? O
Hang O
it O
, O
the O
family O
’s O
low O
enough O
already O
, O
without O


her O
. O

A O
governess O
is O
all O
very O
well O
, O
but O
I O
’d O
rather O
have O
a O
lady O


for O
my O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
I O
’m O
a O
liberal O
man O
; O
but O
I O
’ve O
proper O
pride O
, O
and O
know O
my O


own O
station O
: O
let O
her O
know O
hers O
. O
And O
I O
’ll O
take O
down O
that O
great O
hectoring O


Nabob B-PERSON
, O
and O
prevent O
him O
from O
being O
made O
a O
greater O
fool O
than O
he O
is O

That O
’s O
why O


I O
told O
him O
to O
look O
out O

lest O
she O
brought O
an O
action O
against O
him O
. O
 O


 O
I O
suppose O
you O
know O

 O
Dobbin B-PERSON

rather O
dubiously O
. O
 O
You O


always O
were O
a O
Tory B-NORP

your O

 O


 O
Come O

 O
the O

Captain O

declined O

join O


Osborne B-PERSON
in O
his O
daily B-DATE
visit O
to O
the O
young O

in O

As O
George B-PERSON
walked O
down O
Southampton B-ORG
Row I-ORG
, O
from O
Holborn B-GPE
, O
he O
laughed O
as O
he O
saw O
, O


at O
the B-FAC
Sedley I-FAC
Mansion I-FAC
, O
in O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
stories O
, O
two B-CARDINAL

The O
fact O
is O
, O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
drawing O

, O
was O
looking O
very O


eagerly O
towards O

where O
Mr. O

dwelt O
, O
on O


the O

Miss O

, O
from O
her O
little O


bedroom O
on O
the O
second B-ORDINAL

, O
was O
in O
observation O
until O
Mr. O

 O
Sister O

he O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON

 O
but O
there O
’s O
nobody O


coming O
; O
 O
and O
laughing O
and O
enjoying O
the O
joke O
hugely O
, O
he O
described O
in O
the O
most O


ludicrous O
terms O
to O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
the O
dismal O
condition O
of O
her O
brother O
. O


 O
I O
think O
it O
’s O
very O
cruel O
of O
you O
to O
laugh O
, O
George B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
looking O


particularly O
unhappy O
; O
but O
George B-PERSON
only O
laughed O
the O
more O
at O
her O
piteous O
and O


discomfited O
mien B-PERSON
, O
persisted O
in O
thinking O
the O
joke O
a O
most O
diverting O
one O
, O
and O


when O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
came O
down O
stairs O
, O
bantered O
her O
with O
a O
great O
deal O
of O


liveliness O
upon O
the O
effect O
of O
her O
charms O
on O
the O
fat O
civilian O
. O
 O


 O
O O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
! O
if O
you O
could O
but O
see O
him O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
 O
he O
said—moaning O
in O


his O
flowered O
dressing O

gown O
— O
writhing O
on O
his O
sofa O
; O
if O
you O
could O

have O
seen O


him O
lolling O
out O
his O
tongue O
to O
Gollop O
the O
apothecary O
. O
 O


 O
See O
whom O
? O
 O
said O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON

 O
Whom O
? O
O O
whom O
? O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
of O

, O
to O

we O
were O
all O
so O
attentive O
, O


by O
the O
way O
, O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O
 O


 O
We O
were O
very O
unkind O
to O
him O
, O
 O
Emmy B-PERSON
said O
, O
blushing O
very O
much O
. O
 O
I O
— O
I O
quite O


forgot O
him O
. O
 O


 O
Of O
course O
you O
did O
, O
 O
cried O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
still O
on O
the O

. O
 O
One O
ca O
n’t O
be O


always O

thinking O
about O

, O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
Can O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
Miss O


Sharp B-PERSON
? O
 O


 O
Except O
when O
he O
overset O
the O
glass O
of O
wine O
at O
dinner O
, O
 O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
said O
, O
with O


a O
haughty O
air O
and O
a O
toss O
of O
the O
head O
, O
 O
I O
never O
gave O
the O

of O
Captain O


Dobbin B-PERSON
one B-CARDINAL

consideration O
. O
 O


 O
Very O
good O
, O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
, O
I O
’ll O
tell O
him O
, O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
; O
and O
as O
he O
spoke O
Miss O


Sharp B-PERSON
began O
to O
have O
a O
feeling O
of O
distrust O
and O
hatred O
towards O
this O
young O


officer O
, O
which O
he O
was O
quite O
unconscious O
of O
having O
inspired O
. O

 O
He O

is O


to O
make O
fun O
of O
me O
, O
is O
he O
? O
 O
thought O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
Has O
he O
been O
laughing O
about O
me O


to O
Joseph B-PERSON
? O
Has O
he O
frightened O
him O
? O
Perhaps O
he O
wo O
n’t O
come O
. O
—A O
film O
passed O
over O


her O
eyes O
, O
and O
her O
heart O
beat O
quite O
quick O
. O


 O
You O
’re O
always O
joking O
, O
 O
said O
she O
, O
smiling O
as O
innocently O
as O
she O
could O

 O
Great O

 O


Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
never O
seen O
a O
Baronet O
, O
as O
far O
as O
she O
knew O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
she O


had O
taken O
leave O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
and O
counted O
the O
guineas O
which O
good O

natured O
Mr. O


Sedley B-PERSON
had O
put O
into O
a O
purse O
for O
her O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
done O
wiping O
her O


eyes O
with O
her O

she O
concluded O
the O
very O
moment O


the O

turned O

, O
she O
began O
to O
depict O
in O


her O
own O
mind O
what O
a O
baronet O
must O
be O
. O
 O
I O
wonder O
, O
does O
he O
wear O
a O
star O
? O
 O


thought O
she O
, O
 O
or O
is O
it O
only O
lords O
that O
wear O
stars O
? O
But O
he O
will O
be O
very O


handsomely O
dressed O
in O
a O
court O
suit O
, O
with O
ruffles O
, O
and O
his O
hair O
a O
little O


powdered O
, O
like O
Mr. O
Wroughton B-PERSON
at O
Covent B-FAC
Garden I-FAC
. O
I O
suppose O
he O
will O
be O
awfully O


proud O
, O
and O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
treated O
most O
contemptuously O
. O
Still O
I O
must O
bear O
my O


hard O
lot O
as O
well O
as O
I O
can O
— O
at O
least O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
amongst O

gentlefolks O
, O


and O
not O
with O
vulgar O
city O
people O
: O
 O
and O
she O
fell O
to O
thinking O
of O
her O
Russell B-PERSON

with O
that O
very O

philosophical O
bitterness O
with O

, O
in O

Crawley I-PERSON

 O
Never O

The O

you O

Rebecca B-PERSON
lay O
awake O

When O

Rebecca B-PERSON

taking O
her O
way O
into O
Oxford B-FAC

, O
summoned O
a O


coach O
from O

It O
is O
needless O
to O
particularize O
the O
number O
of O
the O

to O
state O
that O
the O
driver O
was O
stationed O

early O

in O
hopes O

him O


with O
the O

It O
is O
likewise O
needless O

that O
the O

, O
if O
he O
had O
any O
such O
hopes O


as O
those O
above O

was O
grossly O

that O
the O

did O
not O
give O
him O
one B-MONEY
single I-MONEY

his O

It O
was O
in O
vain O
that O
Jehu B-PERSON

that O

flung O
down O
Miss O

that O

His O

Peter B-PERSON

when O

At O

there O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
, O
his O


younger O
brother O
Rawdon B-PERSON
used O
to O
lick O
him O
violently O

But O
though O
his O
parts O
were O


not O
brilliant O

he O
made O
up O
for O
his O
lack O

by O

industry O

and O
was O
never O

during O

At O
college O
his O
career O
was O
of O

highly O

And O
here O
he O
prepared O


himself O
for O
public O

he O
was O

But O
though O
he O
had O
a O
fine O
flux O

and O
delivered O
his O
little O
voice O
with O


great O
pomposity O

pleasure O
to O
himself O

and O
never O
advanced O
any O
sentiment O

opinion O
which O
was O
not O
perfectly O
trite O

stale O
, O
and O
supported O
by O
a O
Latin B-LANGUAGE


quotation O
; O
yet O
he O
failed O
somehow O

in O
spite O
of O
a O
mediocrity O
which O
ought O
to O


have O
insured O
any O
man O
a O

He O
did O
not O
even O
get O

all O

Sir O

If O

Sir O

might O

become O
very O

if O

an O
attorney O

with O
no O

his O

might O

achieved O

himself O
a O
very O
considerable O


influence O

But O
he O
was O
unluckily O
endowed O
with O
a O
good O

a O
large O

encumbered O
estate O

both O
of O
which O
went O
rather O

to O
advance O
him O

He O
had O
a O
taste O
for O
law O

which O
cost O
him O
many B-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL


yearly B-DATE

and O
being O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
clever O
to O
be O
robbed O

as O
he O
said O

by O
any O

allowed O
his O

be O
mismanaged O
by O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL

whom O
he O
all O


equally O
mistrusted O

He O
was O
such O
a O
sharp O
landlord O

that O
he O
could O
hardly O
find O


any O

bankrupt O

and O
such O
a O
close O

as O
to O

almost O
the O

revengeful O
Nature B-WORK_OF_ART
grudged O
him O
the O

As O
he O


would O
not O
pay O
honest O

he O
had O
the O
satisfaction O


of O
finding O
that O
four B-CARDINAL

took O

his O

the O

for O


his O

from O

In O
disposition O
he O
was O
sociable O

far O
from O

he O
rather O


preferred O

half O

ten B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL


pounds O

an O
establishment O

, O
poor O
Rebecca B-PERSON
( O
and O
my O
figure O
is O
far O


better O

hers O

has O
only O
herself O
and O
her O
own O

Well O
, O
let O


us O
see O
if O
my O

can O
not O
provide O
me O
with O
an O
honourable O
maintenance O
, O
and O
if O


some B-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
the O
other O
I O
can O
not O
show O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
my O
real O
superiority O
over O


her O
. O
Not O
that O
I O
dislike O
poor O
Amelia B-PERSON
: O
who O
can O
dislike O
such O
a O
harmless O
, O


good O
- O
natured O
creature?—only O
it O
will O
be O
a B-DATE
fine I-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
I O
can O
take O
my O
place O


above O
her O
in O
the O
world O
, O
as O
why O
, O
indeed O
, O
should O
I O
not O
? O
 O
Thus O
it O
was O
that O
our O


little O
romantic O
friend O
formed O
visions O
of O
the O
future O
for O
herself,—nor O
must O
we O


be O
scandalised O
that O
, O
in O
all O
her O
castles O
in O
the O
air O
, O
a O
husband O
was O
the O


principal O
inhabitant O
. O
Of O
what O
else O
have O
young O
ladies O
to O
think O
, O
but O
husbands O
? O


Of O
what O
else O
do O
their O
dear O
mammas O
think O
? O
 O
I O
must O
be O
my O
own O
mamma O
, O
 O
said O


Rebecca B-PERSON
; O
not O
without O
a O
tingling O
consciousness O
of O
defeat O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
over O


her O
little O
misadventure O
with O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
. O


So O
she O
wisely O
determined O
to O
render O
her O
position O
with O
the O
Queen O
’s O
Crawley B-PERSON


family O
comfortable O
and O
secure O
, O
and O
to O
this O
end O
resolved O
to O
make O
friends O
of O


every O
one O
around O
her O
who O
could O
at O
all O
interfere O
with O
her O
comfort O
. O


As O
my O
Lady O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O
not O
one O
of O
these O
personages O
, O
and O
a O
woman O
, O
moreover O
, O


so O
indolent O
and O
void O
of O
character O
as O
not O
to O
be O
of O
the O
least O
consequence O
in O


her O
own O
house O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
soon O
found O
that O
it O
was O
not O
at O
all O
necessary O
to O


cultivate O
her O
good O
will O
— O
indeed O
, O
impossible O
to O
gain O
it O
. O
She O
used O
to O
talk O
to O


her O
pupils O
about O
their O
 O
poor O
mamma O
; O
 O
and O
, O
though O
she O
treated O
that O
lady O
with O


every O
demonstration O
of O
cool O
respect O
, O
it O
was O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
that O


she O
wisely O
directed O
the O
chief O
part O
of O
her O
attentions O
. O


With O
the O
young O
people O
, O
whose O
applause O
she O
thoroughly O
gained O
, O
her O
method O
was O


pretty O
simple O
. O
She O
did O
not O
pester O
their O
young O
brains O
with O
too O
much O
learning O
, O


but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
let O
them O
have O
their O
own O
way O
in O
regard O
to O
educating O


themselves O
; O
for O
what O
instruction O
is O
more O
effectual O
than O
self O
- O
instruction O
? O


The O
eldest O
was O
rather O
fond O
of O
books O
, O
and O
as O
there O
was O
in O
the O
old O
library O
at O


Queens B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
a O
considerable O
provision O
of O
works O
of O
light O
literature O
of O
the O


last B-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
both O
in O
the O
French B-NORP
and O
English B-LANGUAGE
languages O
( O
they O
had O
been O


purchased O
by O
the O
Secretary O
of O
the O
Tape O
and O
Sealing O
Wax O
Office O
at O
the O
period O


of O
his O
disgrace O
) O
, O
and O
as O
nobody O
ever O
troubled O
the O
bookshelves O
but O
herself O
, O


Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
enabled O
agreeably O
, O
and O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
playing O
, O
to O
impart O
a O


great O
deal O
of O
instruction O
to O
Miss O
Rose B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
. O


She O
and O
Miss B-PERSON
Rose I-PERSON
thus O
read O
together O
many O
delightful O
French B-LANGUAGE
and O
English B-LANGUAGE


works O
, O
among O
which O
may O
be O
mentioned O
those O
of O
the O
learned O
Dr. O
Smollett B-PERSON
, O
of O


the O
ingenious O
Mr. O
Henry B-PERSON
Fielding I-PERSON
, O
of O
the O
graceful O
and O
fantastic O
Monsieur O


Crèbillon B-PERSON
the O
younger O
, O
whom O
our O
immortal O
poet O
Gray B-PERSON
so O
much O
admired O
, O
and O
of O


the O
universal O
Monsieur O
de O
Voltaire O
. O
Once O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
asked O
what O
the O


young O
people O
were O
reading O
, O
the O
governess O
replied O
 O
Smollett B-PERSON
. O
 O
 O
Oh O
, O
Smollett B-PERSON
, O
 O


said O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
quite O
satisfied O
. O
 O
His O
history O
is O
more O
dull O
, O
but O
by O
no O


means O
so O
dangerous O
as O
that O
of O
Mr. O
Hume B-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
history O
you O
are O
reading O
? O
 O


 O
Yes O
, O
 O
said O
Miss B-PERSON
Rose I-PERSON
; O
without O
, O
however O
, O
adding O
that O
it O
was O
the O
history O
of O


Mr. O
Humphrey B-PERSON
Clinker I-PERSON
. O
On O
another O
occasion O
he O
was O
rather O
scandalised O
at O


finding O
his O
sister O
with O
a O
book O
of O
French B-NORP
plays O
; O
but O
as O
the O
governess O


remarked O
that O
it O
was O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
acquiring O
the O
French B-NORP
idiom O
in O


conversation O
, O
he O
was O
fain O
to O
be O
content O
. O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
diplomatist O
, O
was O


exceedingly O
proud O
of O
his O
own O
skill O
in O
speaking O
the O
French B-LANGUAGE
language O
( O
for O
he O


was O
of O
the O
world O
still O
) O
, O
and O
not O
a O
little O
pleased O
with O
the O
compliments O
which O


the O
governess O
continually O
paid O
him O
upon O
his O
proficiency O
. O


Miss O
Violet B-PERSON
’s O
tastes O
were O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
more O
rude O
and O
boisterous O
than O


those O
of O
her O
sister O
. O
She O
knew O
the O
sequestered O
spots O
where O
the O
hens O
laid O


their O
eggs O
. O
She O
could O
climb O
a O
tree O
to O
rob O
the O
nests O
of O
the O
feathered O


songsters O
of O
their O
speckled O
spoils O
. O
And O
her O
pleasure O
was O
to O
ride O
the O
young O


colts O
, O
and O
to O
scour O
the O
plains O
like O
Camilla B-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
the O
favourite O
of O
her O


father O
and O
of O
the O
stable O
- O
men O
. O
She O
was O
the O
darling O
, O
and O
withal O
the O
terror O
of O


the O
cook O
; O
for O
she O
discovered O
the O
haunt O
of O
the O
jam O
- O
pots O
and O
would O
attack O
them O


when O
they O
were O
within O
her O
reach O
. O
She O
and O
her O
sister O
were O
engaged O
in O
constant O


battles O
. O
Any O
of O
which O
peccadilloes O
, O
if O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
discovered O
, O
she O
did O
not O


tell O
them O
to O
Lady O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
who O
would O
have O
told O
them O
to O
the O
father O
, O
or O
worse O
, O


to O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
; O
but O
promised O
not O
to O
tell O
if O
Miss O
Violet B-PERSON
would O
be O
a O
good O
girl O


and O
love O
her O
governess O
. O


With O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
was O
respectful O
and O
obedient O
. O
She O
used O
to O


consult O
him O
on O
passages O
of O
French B-NORP
which O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
, O
though O
her O


mother O
was O
a O
Frenchwoman B-NORP
, O
and O
which O
he O
would O
construe O
to O
her O
satisfaction O
: O


and O
, O
besides O
giving O
her O
his O
aid O
in O
profane O
literature O
, O
he O
was O
kind O
enough O
to O


select O
for O
her O
books O
of O
a O
more O
serious O
tendency O
, O
and O
address O
to O
her O
much O
of O


his O
conversation O
. O
She O
admired O
, O
beyond O
measure O
, O
his O
speech O
at O
the O


Quashimaboo O
- O
Aid O
Society O
; O
took O
an O
interest O
in O
his O
pamphlet O
on O
malt O
; O
was O
often O


affected O
, O
even O
to O
tears O
, O
by O
his O
discourses O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
and O
would O
say—Oh O
, O


thank O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
 O
with O
a O
sigh O
, O
and O
a O
look O
up O
to O
heaven O
, O
that O
made O
him O


occasionally O
condescend O
to O
shake O
hands O
with O
her O
. O
 O
Blood O
is O
everything O
, O
after O


all O
, O
 O
would O
that O
aristocratic O
religionist O
say O
. O
 O
How O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
is O
awakened O


by O
my O
words O
, O
when O
not O
one O
of O
the O
people O
here O
is O
touched O
. O
I O
am O
too O
fine O
for O


them O
— O
too O
delicate O
. O
I O
must O
familiarise O
my O
style O
— O
but O
she O
understands O
it O
. O
Her O


mother O
was O
a O
Montmorency B-GPE
. O
 O


Indeed O
it O
was O
from O
this O
famous O
family O
, O
as O
it O
appears O
, O
that O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
, O
by O


the O
mother O
’s O
side O
, O
was O
descended O
. O
Of O
course O
she O
did O
not O
say O
that O
her O
mother O


had O
been O
on O
the O
stage O
; O
it O
would O
have O
shocked O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
religious O


scruples O
. O
How O
many O
noble O

émigrées B-DATE

had O
this O
horrid O
revolution O


plunged O
in O
poverty O
! O
She O
had O
several O
stories O
about O
her O
ancestors O
ere O
she O
had O


been O
many B-DATE
months I-DATE
in O
the O
house O
; O
some O
of O
which O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
happened O
to O
find O
in O


D’Hozier O
’s O
dictionary O
, O
which O
was O
in O
the O
library O
, O
and O
which O
strengthened O
his O


belief O
in O
their O
truth O
, O
and O
in O
the O
high O
- O
breeding O
of O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
Are O
we O
to O


suppose O
from O
this O
curiosity O
and O
prying O
into O
dictionaries O
, O
could O
our O
heroine O


suppose O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O
interested O
in O
her?—no B-GPE
, O
only O
in O
a O
friendly O
way O
. O


Have O
we O
not O
stated O
that O
he O
was O
attached O
to O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
Sheepshanks I-PERSON
? O


He O
took O
Rebecca B-PERSON
to O
task O
once O
or O
twice O
about O
the O
propriety O
of O
playing O
at O


backgammon O
with O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
saying O
that O
it O
was O
a O
godless O
amusement O
, O
and O
that O


she O
would O
be O
much O
better O
engaged O
in O
reading O
 O
Thrump B-WORK_OF_ART
’s I-WORK_OF_ART
Legacy I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
 O
or O
 O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Blind I-WORK_OF_ART

of I-WORK_OF_ART
Moorfields I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
 O
or O
any O
work O
of O
a O
more O
serious O
nature O
; O
but O
Miss O


Sharp B-PERSON
said O
her O
dear O
mother O
used O
often O
to O
play O
the O
same O
game O
with O
the O
old O


Count O
de B-PERSON
Trictrac I-PERSON
and O
the O
venerable O
Abbè B-PERSON
du I-PERSON
Cornet I-PERSON
, O
and O
so O
found O
an O
excuse O


for O
this O
and O
other O
worldly O
amusements O
. O


But O
it O
was O
not O
only O
by O
playing O
at O
backgammon O
with O
the O
Baronet O
, O
that O
the O


little O
governess O
rendered O
herself O
agreeable O
to O
her O
employer O
. O
She O
found O
many O


different O
ways O
of O
being O
useful O
to O
him O
. O
She O
read O
over O
, O
with O
indefatigable O


patience O
, O
all O
those O
law O
papers O
, O
with O
which O
, O
before O
she O
came O
to O
Queen B-PERSON
’s O


Crawley B-PERSON
, O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
entertain O
her O
. O
She O
volunteered O
to O
copy O
many O
of O


his O
letters O
, O
and O
adroitly O
altered O
the O
spelling O
of O
them O
so O
as O
to O
suit O
the O


usages O
of O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE
day I-DATE

She O
became O
interested O
in O
everything O
appertaining O


to O
the O
estate O
, O
to O
the O
farm O
, O
the O
park O
, O
the O
garden O
, O
and O
the O
stables O
; O
and O
so O


delightful O
a O
companion O
was O
she O
, O
that O
the O
Baronet O
would O
seldom O
take O
his O


after O
- O
breakfast O
walk O
without O
her O
( O
and O
the O
children O
of O
course O
) O
, O
when O
she O


would O
give O
her O
advice O
as O
to O
the O
trees O
which O
were O
to O
be O
lopped O
in O
the O


shrubberies O

Before O
she O
had O
been O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
at O


Queen B-PERSON
’s O
Crawley B-PERSON
she O
had O
quite O
won O
the O
Baronet O

confidence O
; O
and O
the O


conversation O
at O
the O
dinner O

table O
, O
which O
before O
used O
to O
be O
held O
between O
him O


and O
Mr. O
Horrocks B-PERSON
the O
butler O
, O
was O
now O
almost O
exclusively O
between O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON

Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
. O
She O
was O
almost O
mistress O
of O
the O
house O
when O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O


absent O
, O
but O
conducted O
herself O
in O
her O
new O

exalted O
situation O
with O
such O


circumspection O
and O
modesty O
as O
not O
to O
offend O
the O
authorities O
of O
the O
kitchen O


and O
stable O
, O
among O
whom O
her O
behaviour O
was O
always O
exceedingly O
modest O
and O


affable O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
a O
different O
person O
from O
the O
haughty O
, O
shy O
, O


dissatisfied O
little O
girl O
whom O
we O
have O
known O
previously O
, O
and O
this O
change O
of O


temper O
proved O
great O
prudence O
, O
a O
sincere O
desire O
of O
amendment O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O


great O
moral O
courage O
on O
her O
part O

Whether O
it O
was O
the O
heart O
which O
dictated O


this O
new O
system O
of O
complaisance O
and O
humility O
adopted O
by O
our O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
is O
to O


be O
proved O
by O
her O
after O
- O
history O
. O
A O
system O
of O
hypocrisy O
, O
which O
lasts O
through O


whole O
years O
, O
is O
one O
seldom O
satisfactorily O
practised O
by O
a O
person O
of O


one B-DATE

twenty I-DATE

however O
, O
our O

will O
recollect O

that O
, O
though O
young O
in O


years O

our O
heroine O
was O
old O
in O
life O

we O
have O

to O
no O

The O
elder O

of O
the O

they O

cordially O
: O
indeed O
, O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
, O
the O

had O
a O
great O
contempt O

seldom O

when O
his O
aunt O
paid O


her O

The O

She O
possessed O


seventy B-QUANTITY

had O
almost O

Rawdon B-PERSON

She O
disliked O
her O


elder O

and O
despised O
him O
as O
a O

In O
return O
he O
did O


not O

to O
state O
that O
her O
soul O

was O
of O

her O

I O

I O
am O
sure O
nothing O

I O

Thus O
it O

that O

Miss O

 O
My O

 O

Miss O

 O
I O
wish O
you O

London B-GPE

I O
could O

 O


Mrs. O

( O
who O

very O
small O

remained O


on O
Miss O

pate O
) O
, O
flung O
up O
her O

said O

 O
I O
think O
Miss O


is O

very O
clever O
, O
 O
with O
the O
most O
killing O
sarcastic O
air O

In O
fact O
, O


Mrs. O
Firkin B-PERSON
had O
that O
natural O
jealousy O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
main O
principles O
of O


every O
honest O
woman O

After O
rebuffing O
Sir O
Huddleston B-PERSON
Fuddleston I-PERSON
, O
Miss O

ordered O
that O
Rawdon B-GPE


Crawley B-GPE
should O
lead O
her O

every B-DATE

and O
that O

she O
would O
have O
Becky B-PERSON

Rawdon B-PERSON
with O
the O


pillow O
. O
 O
We O
must O
sit O
together O

 O
she O

 O
We O
’re O
the O
only B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
Christians B-NORP


in O
the O
county O
, O
my O
love—in O
which O
case O
, O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
, O
that O
religion O


was O
at O
a O
very O
low O
ebb O
in O
the O
county O
of O
Hants O
. O


Besides O
being O
such O
a O
fine O
religionist O
, O
Miss O

was O
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O


an O
Ultra B-ORG

liberal O
in O
opinions O

and O
always O
took O
occasion O
to O
express O
these O
in O


the O
most O
candid O
manner O
. O


 O
What O
is O
birth O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
 O
she O
would O
say O
to O
Rebecca—Look O
at O
my O
brother O


Pitt B-PERSON
; O
look O
at O
the O
Huddlestons B-ORG
, O
who O
have O
been O

since O
Henry B-PERSON

; O
look O
at O


poor O

any O
one O
of O
them O
equal O
to O
you O
in O
intelligence O


or O

? O
Equal O
to O

you O

— O
they O
are O
not O
even O
equal O
to O
poor O

Riggs B-PERSON
, O
my O

or O
Bowls B-ORG

my O

You O
, O
my O

are O
a O
little O


paragon O
— O
positively O
a O
little O

— O
You O
have O
more O
brains O
than O
half O
the O


shire O
— O
if O
merit O
had O
its O
reward O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
a O
Duchess B-ORG
— O
no O
, O
there O
ought O
to O


be O
no O
duchesses O
at O
all O
— O
but O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
no O

and O
I O
consider O


you O
, O
my O
love O

as O
my O
equal O
in O
every O
respect O
; O
and O
— O
will O
you O
put O
some O

the O

my O

will O
you O
pick O
this O

of O
mine O

alter O
it O

you O


who O
can O
do O
it O
so O
well O
? O
 O
So O
this O
old O

used O
to O
make O
her O
equal O


run O
her O
errands O

execute O
her O
millinery O
, O
and O
read O
her O
to O

At O
this O
time O

as O

been O


thrown O
into O
a O
considerable O
state O
of O
excitement O
by O
two B-CARDINAL
events O

which O
, O
as O

When O
Miss O

Sharp I-PERSON
wrote O
to O
her O
beloved O
friend O
the O
account O
of O
the O


little O
ball O
at O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O


Captain O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
distinguished O
her O
, O
she O
did O
not O
, O
strange O
to O
relate O
, O
give O


an O
altogether O
accurate O
account O
of O
the O
transaction O
. O
The O
Captain O
had O


distinguished O
her O
a O
great O
number O
of O
times O
before O
. O
The O
Captain O
had O
met O
her O
in O


a O
half B-CARDINAL
score O
of O
walks O
. O
The O
Captain O
had O
lighted O
upon O
her O
in O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
of O


corridors O
and O
passages O
. O
The O
Captain O
had O
hung O
over O
her O
piano O
twenty B-CARDINAL
times O
of O


an O
evening O
( O
my O
Lady O
was O
now O
upstairs O

being O
ill O

and O
nobody O
heeded O
her O
) O
as O


Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
sang O

The O
Captain O
had O
written O
her O
notes O
( O
the O
best O
that O
the O
great O


blundering O
dragoon O
could O
devise O

but O
dulness O
gets O
on O
as O
well O
as O


any O
other O
quality O

) O
. O
But O
when O
he O
put O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
the O
notes O
into O


the O
leaves O
of O
the O
song O
she O
was O
singing O
, O
the O
little O
governess O
, O
rising O
and O


looking O
him O
steadily O
in O
the O
face O
, O
took O
up O
the O
triangular O
missive O
daintily O
, O


and O
waved O
it O
about O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
cocked O
hat O
, O
and O
she O
, O
advancing O
to O
the O


enemy O
, O
popped O
the O
note O
into O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
made O
him O
a O
very O
low O
curtsey O
, O
and O


went O
back O
to O
her O
place O
, O
and O
began O
to O
sing O
away O
again O
more O
merrily O
than O


ever O

 O
What O

that O
? O
 O
said O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON

interrupted O
in O
her O
after O

dinner O
doze O
by O


the O
stoppage O
of O
the O

 O
It O
’s O
a O
false O
note O
, O
 O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
said O
with O
a O
laugh O
; O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
fumed O


with O
rage O

mortification O

Seeing O
the O
evident O
partiality O
of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
for O
the O
new O

how O


good O
it O
was O
of O
Mrs. O

not O

the O

his O
great O
pleasure O
was O
to O

Crawley B-GPE


parsonage O

whither O
Miss O

came O
too O
; O
and O
as O
their O

ill O

not O


the O

So O
the O

) O
came O
with O
Miss O


Sharp B-PERSON

and O
of O
an O
evening O

would O
walk O
back O
together O

Not O


Miss O

she O
preferred O

the O
walk O

in O
at O
the O
little O

through O
the O

, O


and O
up O
the O
checkered O
avenue O
to O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-GPE
, O
was O
charming O
in O
the O


moonlight O
to O
two B-CARDINAL
such O
lovers O
of O
the O
picturesque O
as O
the O
Captain O

Miss O


Rebecca B-PERSON

 O
O O
those O

, O
those O
stars O
! O
 O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON
would O
say O
, O
turning O
her O
twinkling O


green O
eyes O
up O
towards O
them O
. O
 O
I O
feel O
myself O
almost O
a O
spirit O
when O
I O
gaze O
upon O


them O

 O


 O
O O
— O
ah O
— O
Gad B-PERSON
— O
yes O
, O
so O
do O
I O
exactly O
, O
Miss O

, O
 O
the O

 O
You O
do O
n’t O
mind O
my O
cigar O
, O
do O
you O
, O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
? O
 O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
loved O
the O
smell O
of O


a O
cigar O
out O
of O
doors O
beyond O
everything O
in O
the O
world O
— O
and O
she O
just O
tasted O
one B-CARDINAL


too O
, O
in O
the O
prettiest O
way O
possible O
, O
and O
gave O
a O
little O
puff O
, O
and O
a O
little O


scream O
, O
and O
a O
little O
giggle O
, O
and O
restored O
the O
delicacy O
to O
the O
Captain O
, O
who O


twirled O
his O
moustache O
, O
and O
straightway O
puffed O
it O
into O
a O
blaze O
that O
glowed O


quite O
red O
in O
the O
dark O
plantation O
, O
and O
swore—Jove B-EVENT
— O
aw O
— O
Gad B-PERSON
— O
aw O
— O
it O
’s O
the O
finest O


segaw O
I O
ever O
smoked O
in O
the O
world O
aw O
, O
 O
for O
his O
intellect O
and O
conversation O


were O
alike O
brilliant O
and O
becoming O
to O
a O
heavy O
young O
dragoon O
. O


Old O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
taking O
his O

and O
talking O
to O
John B-PERSON


Horrocks O
about O
a O
 O

espied O
the O

from O

and O
with O
dreadful O
oaths O
swore O
that O
if O
it O

Miss O

, O
he O
’d O
take O
Rawdon B-PERSON

 O
Mr. O

a O
match O


for’n O

Sir O

XII O

Sentimental O
Chapter O


WE O
must O
now O
take O
leave O
of O
Arcadia B-ORG

and O
those O
amiable O
people O
practising O
the O


rural O
virtues O
there O
, O
and O
travel O
back O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
to O
inquire O
what O
has O
become O


of O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
 O
We O
do O
n’t O
care O
a O
fig O
for O
her O
, O
 O
writes O
some O
unknown O


correspondent O
with O
a O
pretty O
little O
handwriting O
and O
a O
pink O
seal O
to O
her O
note O
. O


 O
She O
is O

fade O

and O
insipid O
, O
 O
and O
adds O
some O
more O
kind O
remarks O
in O
this O


strain O
, O
which O
I O
should O
never O
have O
repeated O
at O
all O
, O
but O
that O
they O
are O
in O


truth O
prodigiously O
complimentary O
to O
the O
young O
lady O
whom O
they O
concern O
. O


Has O
the O
beloved O
reader O
, O
in O
his O
experience O
of O
society O
, O
never O
heard O
similar O


remarks O
by O
good O
- O
natured O
female O
friends O
; O
who O
always O
wonder O
what O
you O


can O

see O
in O
Miss O
Smith B-PERSON
that O
is O
so O
fascinating O
; O
or O
what O


could O

induce O
Major O
Jones B-PERSON
to O
propose O
for O
that O
silly O


insignificant O
simpering O
Miss O
Thompson B-PERSON
, O
who O
has O
nothing O
but O
her O
wax O
- O
doll O
face O


to O
recommend O
her O
? O
What O
is O
there O
in O
a O
pair O
of O
pink O
cheeks O
and O
blue O
eyes O


forsooth O
? O
these O
dear O
Moralists B-PERSON
ask O
, O
and O
hint O
wisely O
that O
the O
gifts O
of O


genius O
, O
the O
accomplishments O
of O
the O
mind O
, O
the O
mastery O
of O
Mangnall B-PERSON
’s O


Questions O
, O
and O
a O
ladylike O
knowledge O
of O
botany O
and O
geology O
, O
the O
knack O
of O


making O
poetry O
, O
the O
power O
of O
rattling O
sonatas O
in O
the O
Herz B-PERSON
- O
manner O
, O
and O
so O


forth O
, O
are O
far O
more O
valuable O
endowments O
for O
a O
female O
, O
than O
those O
fugitive O


charms O
which O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
will O
inevitably O
tarnish O
. O
It O
is O
quite O
edifying O
to O


hear O
women O
speculate O
upon O
the O
worthlessness O
and O
the O
duration O
of O
beauty O
. O


But O
though O
virtue O
is O
a O
much O
finer O
thing O
, O
and O
those O
hapless O
creatures O
who O


suffer O
under O
the O
misfortune O
of O
good O
looks O
ought O
to O
be O
continually O
put O
in O


mind O
of O
the O
fate O
which O
awaits O
them O
; O
and O
though O
, O
very O
likely O
, O
the O
heroic O


female O
character O
which O
ladies O
admire O
is O
a O
more O
glorious O
and O
beautiful O
object O


than O
the O
kind O
, O
fresh O
, O
smiling O
, O
artless O
, O
tender O
little O
domestic O
goddess O
, O
whom O


men O
are O
inclined O
to O
worship O
— O
yet O
the O
latter O
and O
inferior O
sort O
of O
women O
must O


have O
this O
consolation O
— O
that O
the O
men O

do O

admire O
them O
after O
all O
; O
and O


that O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
our O
kind O
friends O
’ O
warnings O
and O
protests O
, O
we O
go O
on O
in O


our O
desperate O
error O
and O
folly O
, O
and O
shall O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
chapter O
. O
Indeed O
, O


for O
my O
own O
part O
, O
though O
I O
have O
been O
repeatedly O
told O
by O
persons O
for O
whom O
I O


have O
the O
greatest O
respect O
, O
that O
Miss O
Brown B-PERSON
is O
an O
insignificant O
chit O
, O
and O


Mrs. O
White B-PERSON
has O
nothing O
but O
her O

petit O
minois B-PERSON
chiffonnè I-PERSON
, O

and O
Mrs. O


Black B-PERSON
has O
not O
a O
word O
to O
say O
for O
herself O
; O
yet O
I O
know O
that O
I O
have O
had O
the O
most O


delightful O
conversations O
with O
Mrs. O
Black B-PERSON
( O
of O
course O
, O
my O
dear O
Madam O
, O
they O
are O


inviolable O
): O
I O
see O
all O
the O
men O
in O
a O
cluster O
round O
Mrs. O
White B-PERSON
’s O
chair O
: O
all O


the O
young O
fellows O
battling O
to O
dance O
with O
Miss O
Brown B-PERSON
; O
and O
so O
I O
am O
tempted O
to O


think O
that O
to O
be O
despised O
by O
her O
sex O
is O
a O
very O
great O
compliment O
to O
a O


woman O
. O


The O
young O
ladies O
in O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
society O
did O
this O
for O
her O
very O
satisfactorily O
. O


For O
instance O
, O
there O
was O
scarcely O
any O
point O
upon O
which O
the O
Misses O
Osborne O
, O


George B-PERSON
’s O
sisters O
, O
and O
the O
Mesdemoiselles O
Dobbin O
agreed O
so O
well O
as O
in O
their O


estimate O
of O
her O
very O
trifling O
merits O
: O
and O
their O
wonder O
that O
their O
brothers O


could O
find O
any O
charms O
in O
her O
. O
 O
We O
are O
kind O
to O
her O
, O
 O
the O
Misses O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
, O


a O
pair O
of O
fine O
black O
- O
browed O
young O
ladies O
who O
had O
had O
the O
best O
of O


governesses O
, O
masters O
, O
and O
milliners O
; O
and O
they O
treated O
her O
with O
such O
extreme O


kindness O
and O
condescension O
, O
and O
patronised O
her O
so O
insufferably O
, O
that O
the O


poor O
little O
thing O

was O

in O
fact O
perfectly O
dumb O
in O
their O
presence O
, O
and O


to O
all O
outward O
appearance O
as O
stupid O
as O
they O
thought O
her O
. O
She O
made O
efforts O
to O


like O
them O
, O
as O
in O
duty O
bound O
, O
and O
as O
sisters O
of O
her O
future O
husband O
. O
She O


passed O
 O
long O
mornings O
 O
with O
them O
— O
the O
most O
dreary O
and O
serious O
of O
forenoons O
. O


She O
drove O
out O
solemnly O
in O
their O
great O
family O
coach O
with O
them O
, O
and O
Miss O
Wirt B-PERSON


their O
governess O

They O
took O
her O
to O
the O

to O
the O

the O

in O
such O
terror O
was O
she O
of O
her O
friends O

she O


almost O
did O
not O
dare O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
hymn O
the O
children O
sang O

Their O
house O


was O
comfortable O

their O

their O
society O
solemn O

genteel O

prodigious O

they O
had O
the O

the O


Foundlin B-WORK_OF_ART

were O
pompous O

intolerably O

After O
every O

( O

Miss O

Miss O

the O

wonder O

 O
What O

could O

George B-PERSON
find O
in O
that O

 O


How O

this O

some O
carping O

How O
is O
it O
that O
Amelia B-PERSON

who O
had O


such O
a O

at O

When O

asked O
Amelia B-PERSON

could O
you O

 O
I O

 O
Dear O

enthusiastic O

so O
? O


Miss O
Wirt B-PERSON
and O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
affectionate O
young O
women O
so O
earnestly O

frequently O
impressed O
upon O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON

his O
romantic O

away O
upon O
Amelia B-PERSON

I O

he O
was O
one O
of O


the O
most O

Somehow O

 O
Did O
you O

how O

at O

poor O
George B-PERSON
on O
duty O
? O
 O


 O
It O

a O
pity O
Frederick B-PERSON
Bulloch I-PERSON
had O

some O
of O

modesty O

the O
elder O

 O
Modesty O
! O
Awkwardness O
you O
mean O
, O
Jane B-PERSON
. O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
Frederick B-PERSON
to O
trample O
a O


hole O
in O
my O
muslin O

, O
as O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
did O
in O

at O
Mrs. O


Perkins B-PERSON

 O


 O
In O

he O
, O
he O
! O
How O
could O
he O
? O
Was O
n’t O
he O
dancing O
with O


Amelia B-PERSON
? O
 O


The O
fact O
is O
, O
when O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
blushed O
so O
, O
and O
looked O
so O
awkward O
, O
he O


remembered O
a O
circumstance O
of O
which O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O


inform O
the O
young O
ladies O
, O
viz O
. O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
calling O
at O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O


house O
already O
, O
on O
the O
pretence O
of O
seeing O
George B-PERSON
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
George B-PERSON


was O
n’t O
there O
, O
only O
poor O
little O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
with O
rather O
a O
sad O
wistful O
face O
, O


seated O
near O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
window O
, O
who O
, O
after O
some O
very O
trifling O
stupid O


talk O
, O
ventured O
to O
ask O
, O
was O
there O
any O
truth O
in O
the O
report O
that O
the O
regiment O


was O
soon O
to O
be O
ordered O
abroad O
; O
and O
had O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
seen O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
that O


day O
? O


The O
regiment O
was O
not O
ordered O
abroad O
as O
yet O
; O
and O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
not O
seen O


George B-PERSON
. O
 O
He O
was O
with O
his O
sister O
, O
most O
likely O
, O
 O
the O
Captain O
said O
. O
 O
Should O
he O


go O
and O
fetch O
the O
truant O
? O
 O
So O
she O
gave O
him O
her O
hand O
kindly O
and O
gratefully O
: O


and O
he O
crossed O
the O
square O
; O
and O
she O
waited O
and O
waited O
, O
but O
George B-PERSON
never O


came O
. O


Poor O
little O
tender O
heart O
! O
and O
so O
it O
goes O
on O
hoping O
and O
beating O
, O
and O
longing O


and O
trusting O
. O
You O
see O
it O
is O
not O
much O
of O
a O
life O
to O
describe O
. O
There O
is O
not O


much O
of O
what O
you O
call O
incident O
in O
it O
. O
Only O
one O
feeling O
all O
day O
— O
when O
will O
he O


come O
? O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
thought O
to O
sleep O
and O
wake O
upon O
. O
I O
believe O
George B-PERSON
was O
playing O


billiards O
with O
Captain O
Cannon B-PERSON
in O
Swallow B-FAC
Street I-FAC
at O
the O
time O
when O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O


asking O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
about O
him O
; O
for O
George B-PERSON
was O
a O
jolly O
sociable O
fellow O
, O
and O


excellent O
in O
all O
games O
of O
skill O
. O


Once O
, O
after O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
absence O
, O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
put O
on O
her O
bonnet O
, O
and O


actually O
invaded O
the O
Osborne B-PERSON
house O
. O
 O
What O
! O
leave O
our O
brother O
to O
come O
to O
us O
? O
 O


said O
the O
young O
ladies O
. O
 O
Have O
you O
had O
a O
quarrel O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
? O
Do O
tell O
us O
! O
 O
No O
, O


indeed O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O
quarrel O
. O
 O
Who O
could O
quarrel O
with O
him O
? O
 O
says O
she O
, O


with O
her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O
She O
only O
came O
over O
to O
— O
to O
see O
her O
dear O


friends O
; O
they O
had O
not O
met O
for O
so O
long O
. O
And O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
she O
was O
so O
perfectly O


stupid O
and O
awkward O
, O
that O
the O
Misses O
Osborne O
and O
their O
governess O
, O
who O
stared O


after O
her O
as O
she O
went O
sadly O
away O
, O
wondered O
more O
than O
ever O
what O
George B-PERSON
could O


see O
in O
poor O
little O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O


Of O
course O
they O
did O
. O
How O
was O
she O
to O
bare O
that O
timid O
little O
heart O
for O
the O


inspection O
of O
those O
young O
ladies O
with O
their O
bold O
black O
eyes O
? O
It O
was O
best O


that O
it O
should O
shrink O
and O
hide O
itself O
. O
I O
know O
the O
Misses O
Osborne O
were O


excellent O
critics O
of O
a O
Cashmere B-PRODUCT
shawl O
, O
or O
a O
pink O
satin O
slip O
; O
and O
when O
Miss O


Turner B-PERSON
had O
hers O
dyed O
purple O
, O
and O
made O
into O
a O
spencer O
; O
and O
when O
Miss O
Pickford B-PERSON


had O
her O
ermine O
tippet O
twisted O
into O
a O
muff O
and O
trimmings O
, O
I O
warrant O
you O
the O


changes O
did O
not O
escape O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
intelligent O
young O
women O
before O
mentioned O
. O
But O


there O
are O
things O
, O
look O
you O
, O
of O
a O
finer O
texture O
than O
fur O
or O
satin O
, O
and O
all O


Solomon B-PERSON
’s O
glories O
, O
and O
all O
the O
wardrobe O
of O
the O
Queen O
of O
Sheba;—things B-LAW


whereof O
the O
beauty O
escapes O
the O
eyes O
of O
many O
connoisseurs O
. O
And O
there O
are O


sweet O
modest O
little O
souls O
on O
which O
you O
light O
, O
fragrant O
and O
blooming O
tenderly O


in O
quiet O
shady O
places O
; O
and O
there O
are O
garden O
- O
ornaments O
, O
as O
big O
as O
brass O


warming O
- O
pans O
, O
that O
are O
fit O
to O
stare O
the O
sun O
itself O
out O
of O
countenance O
. O
Miss O


Sedley B-PERSON
was O
not O
of O
the O
sunflower O
sort O
; O
and O
I O
say O
it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
rules O
of O


all O
proportion O
to O
draw O
a O
violet O
of O
the O
size O
of O
a O
double O

No O
, O
indeed O
; O
the O
life O
of O
a O
good O
young O
girl O
who O
is O
in O
the O
paternal O
nest O
as O


yet O
, O
ca O
n’t O
have O
many O
of O
those O
thrilling O
incidents O
to O
which O
the O
heroine O
of O


romance O
commonly O
lays O
claim O

Snares O

may O

off O

hawks O
may O
be O
abroad O

from O
which O
they O
escape O
or O
by O
whom O
they O


suffer O
; O
but O
the O
young O
ones O
in O
the O

have O
a O
pretty O
comfortable O
unromantic O


sort O
of O
existence O
in O
the O

till O
it O

Amelia B-PERSON

just O


as O

I O
do O

think O
poor O
Amelia B-PERSON
cared O
anything O
about O
Brienne B-PERSON

Montmirail B-PERSON
, O
or O
was O
fairly O
interested O
in O
the O

until O
the O
abdication O

Emperor O

when O
she O
clapped O

said O
prayers,—oh O

how O

and O


flung O
herself O

all O

to O
the O


astonishment O

The O


fact O

peace O

Europe B-LOC

the O

thought O
about O
him O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL
moment O

his O


was O
the O
very O
last O

She O
never O

seen O
a O
man O
so O


beautiful O

such O

Talk O

what O

it O
to O
George B-PERSON

She O
had O


seen O
Mr. O
Brummell B-PERSON

whom O
everybody O
praised O
so O

Compare O
such O
a O
person O
as O
that O


to O
her O
George B-PERSON

Not O
amongst O
all O
the O

him O

He O
was O


only O
good O
enough O

a O
fairy O

oh O
, O
what O
magnanimity O
to O
stoop O
to O


such O
a O
humble O
Cinderella B-PERSON
! O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
would O
have O
tried O
to O
check O
this O


blind O
devotion O
very O
likely O
, O
had O
she O
been O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
confidante O
, O
but O
not O
with O


much O
success O
, O
depend O
upon O
it O

It O
is O
in O
the O
nature O
and O
instinct O
of O
some O


women O

Some O
are O
made O
to O

wish O
any O

that O

the O

While O
under O
this O
overpowering O
impression O
, O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
neglected O
her O
twelve B-CARDINAL


dear O
friends O
at O
Chiswick B-GPE
most O
cruelly O
, O
as O
such O
selfish O
people O
commonly O

She O
had O
but O
this O
subject O
, O
of O
course O

to O
think O
about O
; O
and O
Miss B-PERSON
Saltire I-PERSON


was O
too O
cold O
for O

she O
could O

the O

had O
little O


Laura B-PERSON
Martin I-PERSON
home O
for O
the B-DATE
holidays I-DATE
; O
and O
my O
belief O
is O
, O
she O
made O
a O
confidante O


of O
her O
, O
and O
promised O
that O
Laura B-PERSON
should O
come O
and O
live O
with O
her O
when O
she O
was O


married O
, O
and O
gave O
Laura B-PERSON
a O
great O
deal O
of O
information O
regarding O
the O
passion O
of O


love O

which O
must O
have O
been O
singularly O
useful O

that O
little O

Alas O

I O
fear O
poor O
Emmy B-PERSON

not O
a O
well O

What O
were O
her O

doing O

not O
to O
keep O
this O
little O
heart O
from O
beating O
so O


fast O
? O
Old O
Sedley B-PERSON
did O
not O
seem O
much O
to O
notice O
matters O

He O
was O
graver O
of O
late O
, O


and O
his O
City O
affairs O
absorbed O
him O
. O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
was O
of O
so O
easy O
and O


uninquisitive O
a O
nature O
, O
that O
she O
was O
n’t O
even O
jealous O
. O
Mr. O

was O
away O

being O
besieged O
by O
an O
Irish B-NORP

herself O

too O
much O
to O
herself O
sometimes O

not O
that O
she O
ever O

for O
, O
to O

George B-PERSON

be O

when O

the O

he O

too O

I O
know O
where O

kept O


that O
packet O
she O
had O
— O

can O

out O

Iachimo B-PERSON

No O

But O
if O
Osborne B-PERSON

were O
short O

soldierlike O
letters O

it O
must O
be O
confessed O

that O
were O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON

letters O
to O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON

this O

to O
such O
a O
multiplicity O
of O
volumes O
as O
not O
the O
most O


sentimental O
reader O
could O
support O
; O
that O
she O
not O
only O
filled O
sheets O
of O
large O


paper O
, O
but O
crossed O
them O
with O
the O
most O
astonishing O
perverseness O
; O
that O
she O


wrote O
whole O
pages O
out O
of O
poetry O
- O
books O
without O
the O
least O
pity O
; O
that O
she O


underlined O
words O
and O
passages O
with O
quite O
a O
frantic O
emphasis O
; O
and O
, O
in O
fine O
, O


gave O
the O
usual O
tokens O
of O
her O
condition O
. O
She O
was O
n’t O
a O
heroine O
. O
Her O
letters O


were O

full O
of O
repetition O
. O
She O
wrote O
rather O
doubtful O
grammar O


sometimes O
, O
and O
in O
her O
verses O
took O
all O
sorts O
of O
liberties O
with O
the O
metre O

oh O

mesdames B-PERSON

if O
you O

you O
all O

the O

Such O
a O
number O
of O
notes O

Lieutenant O

Osborne B-PERSON

Well O
, O
Stubble B-PERSON

Spooney B-GPE
and O
the O

indulged O
in O
most O
romantic O


conjectures O
regarding O
this O
female O
correspondent O
of O

that O


it O
was O
a O
Duchess B-ORG
in O
London B-GPE
who O
was O
in O

him,—or O
that O
it O

General O

who O
was O
engaged O
to O
somebody O
else O

a O
Member O
of O
Parliament B-ORG

lady O
, O
who O
proposed O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O


and O
an O

that O
it O
was O
some O
other O
victim O
of O
a O
passion O
delightfully O


exciting O
, O
romantic O
, O
and O
disgraceful O
to O
all O
parties O
, O
on O
none O
of O
which O


conjectures O
would O
Osborne B-PERSON
throw O
the O
least O
light O
, O
leaving O
his O
young O
admirers O


and O
friends O
to O
invent O

arrange O
their O
whole O
history O

And O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
would O
never O
have O
been O
known O
at O
all O

for O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON

indiscretion O

The O
Captain O
was O
eating O
his O


breakfast O
one O
day O
in O
the O
mess O

while O
Cackle O
, O
the O
assistant O

surgeon O
, O
and O


the O
two B-CARDINAL
above O
- O
named O
worthies O
were O
speculating O
upon O
Osborne B-PERSON

intrigue O
— O
Stubble B-PERSON
holding O
out O
that O
the O
lady O
was O
a O
Duchess B-ORG
about O
Queen O


Charlotte B-PERSON

court O
, O
and O
Cackle O
vowing O
she O
was O
an O
opera O
- O
singer O
of O
the O
worst O


reputation O
. O
At O
this O
idea O
Dobbin B-PERSON
became O
so O
moved O
, O
that O
though O
his O
mouth O
was O


full O
of O
eggs O
and O
bread O
- O
and O
- O
butter O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
though O
he O
ought O
not O
to O


have O
spoken O
at O
all O
, O
yet O
he O
could O
n’t O
help O
blurting O
out O
, O
 O
Cackle O
, O
you O
’re O
a O


stupid O
fool O
. O
You O
’re O
always O
talking O
nonsense O
and O
scandal O
. O
Osborne B-PERSON
is O
not O


going O
to O
run O
off O
with O
a O
Duchess B-ORG
or O
ruin O
a O
milliner O

Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON

one O
of O


the O
most O
charming O
young O
women O
that O
ever O
lived O

He O

been O
engaged O
to O
her O
ever O


so O
long O
; O
and O
the O
man O
who O
calls O
her O
names O
had O
better O
not O
do O
so O
in O
my O


hearing O
. O
 O
With O
which O
, O
turning O
exceedingly O
red O
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
ceased O
speaking O
, O
and O


almost O
choked O
himself O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O

The O
story O
was O
over O
the O
regiment O
in O


half O

an O

hour O
; O
and O
that O
very O
evening O
Mrs. O
Major O

evening O

 O
Only O
I O

George B-PERSON

If O

 O
I O

fond O

 O
the O

with O
a O


self O

satisfied O
air O
; O
and O
went O
off O
to O
finish O
the O
evening O
with O
some O
jolly O


fellows O
in O
the O
mess O
room O

Amelia B-PERSON
meanwhile O
, O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC

was O
looking O
at O
the O
moon O

which O
was O


shining O
upon O
that O
peaceful O
spot O
, O
as O
well O
as O
upon O
the O
square O
of O
the O
Chatham B-GPE


barracks O
, O
where O
Lieutenant O
Osborne B-PERSON
was O
quartered O
, O
and O
thinking O
to O
herself O


how O
her O
hero O
was O
employed O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
is O
visiting O
the O
sentries O
, O
thought O
she O
; O


perhaps O
he O
is O
bivouacking O
; O
perhaps O
he O
is O
attending O
the O
couch O
of O
a O
wounded O


comrade O
, O
or O
studying O
the O
art O
of O
war O
up O
in O
his O
own O
desolate O
chamber O
. O
And O
her O


kind O
thoughts O
sped O
away O
as O
if O
they O
were O
angels O
and O
had O
wings O
, O
and O
flying O


down O
the O
river O
to O
Chatham B-GPE
and O
Rochester B-GPE
, O
strove O
to O
peep O
into O
the O
barracks O


where O
George B-PERSON
was O
… O
. O
All O
things O
considered O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
as O
well O
the O
gates O


were O
shut O
, O
and O
the O
sentry O
allowed O
no O
one O
to O
pass O
; O
so O
that O
the O
poor O
little O


white O

robed O
angel O
could O
not O
hear O
the O
songs O
those O
young O
fellows O
were O
roaring O


over O

The B-DATE
day I-DATE
after O
the O
little O
conversation O
at O
Chatham B-GPE
barracks O
, O
young O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O


to O
show O
that O
he O
would O
be O
as O
good O
as O
his O
word O
, O
prepared O
to O
go O
to O
town O
, O


thereby O
incurring O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
applause O
. O
 O
I O
should O
have O
liked O
to O
make O


her O
a O
little O
present O
, O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
friend O
in O
confidence O
, O
 O
only O
I O
am O


quite O
out O
of O
cash O
until O
my O
father O
tips O
up O
. O
 O
But O
Dobbin B-PERSON
would O
not O
allow O
this O


good O
nature O
and O
generosity O
to O
be O
balked O
, O
and O
so O
accommodated O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON


with O
a O
few O
pound O
notes O
, O
which O
the O
latter O
took O
after O
a O
little O
faint O


scruple O
. O


And O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
would O
have O
bought O
something O
very O
handsome O
for O
Amelia B-PERSON
; O


only O
, O
getting O
off O
the O
coach O
in O
Fleet B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
he O
was O
attracted O
by O
a O
handsome O


shirt O
- O
pin O
in O
a O
jeweller O
’s O
window O
, O
which O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
; O
and O
having O
paid O


for O
that O
, O
had O
very O
little O
money O
to O
spare O
for O
indulging O
in O
any O
further O


exercise O
of O
kindness O
. O
Never O
mind O
: O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
it O
was O
not O
his O
presents O


Amelia B-PERSON
wanted O
. O
When O
he O
came O
to O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
her O
face O
lighted O
up O
as O
if O
he O


had O
been O
sunshine O
. O
The O
little O
cares O
, O
fears O
, O
tears O
, O
timid O
misgivings O
, O


sleepless O
fancies O
of O
I O
do O
n’t O

how O
many O
days O

were O
forgotten O
, O


under O
one O
moment O

influence O
of O
that O
familiar O

smile O

He O
beamed O


on O
her O
from O
the O
drawing O

— O
magnificent O
, O
with O
ambrosial O
whiskers O

announced O
Captain O
Osbin B-PERSON
( O
having O
conferred O
a O


brevet O

on O
that O
young O
officer O

blazed O
with O
a O

saw O
the O


little O

flush O

jump O
up O
from O
her O
watching O

and O
Sambo B-PERSON
retreated O
: O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
door O
was O
shut O
, O
she O
went O


fluttering O
to O
Lieutenant O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
’s O
heart O
as O
if O
it O
was O
the O
only O


natural O
home O
for O
her O
to O
nestle O
in O

Oh O
, O
thou O
poor O
panting O
little O
soul O
! O
The O


very O
finest O
tree O
in O
the O
whole O
forest O
, O
with O
the O
straightest O
stem O

and O
the O


strongest O
arms O
, O
and O
the O
thickest O
foliage O
, O
wherein O
you O
choose O
to O
build O
and O


coo O
, O
may O
be O
marked O
, O
for O
what O
you O
know O
, O
and O
may O
be O
down O
with O
a O
crash O
ere O


long O

What O
an O
old O

old O
simile O
that O
is O

between O

In O
the O
meanwhile O
, O
George B-PERSON
kissed O
her O
very O
kindly O
on O
her O
forehead O
and O


glistening O
eyes O
, O
and O
was O
very O
gracious O
and O
good O
; O
and O
she O
thought O
his O
diamond O


shirt O
- O
pin O
( O
which O
she O
had O
not O
known O
him O
to O
wear O
before O

the O

The O
observant O
reader O
, O
who O
has O
marked O
our O
young O
Lieutenant O
’s O
previous O


behaviour O
, O
and O
has O
preserved O
our O
report O
of O
the O
brief O
conversation O
which O
he O


has O
just O
had O
with O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
has O
possibly O
come O
to O
certain O
conclusions O


regarding O
the O
character O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
. O
Some O
cynical O
Frenchman B-NORP
has O
said O
that O


there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
parties O
to O
a O
love O
- O
transaction O
: O
the O
one O
who O
loves O
and O
the O
other O


who O
condescends O
to O
be O
so O
treated O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
love O
is O
occasionally O
on O
the O


man O
’s O
side O
; O
perhaps O
on O
the O
lady O
’s O
. O
Perhaps O
some O
infatuated O
swain B-PERSON
has O
ere O


this O
mistaken O
insensibility O
for O
modesty O
, O
dulness O
for O
maiden B-ORG
reserve I-ORG
, O
mere O


vacuity O
for O
sweet O
bashfulness O
, O
and O
a O
goose O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
for O
a O
swan O
. O
Perhaps O


some O
beloved O
female O
subscriber O
has O
arrayed O
an O
ass O
in O
the O
splendour O
and O
glory O


of O
her O
imagination O
; O
admired O
his O
dulness O
as O
manly O
simplicity O
; O
worshipped O
his O


selfishness O
as O
manly O
superiority O
; O
treated O
his O
stupidity O
as O
majestic O
gravity O
, O


and O
used O
him O
as O
the O
brilliant O
fairy O
Titania B-GPE
did O
a O
certain O
weaver O
at O
Athens B-GPE
. O


I O
think O
I O
have O
seen O
such O
comedies O
of O
errors O
going O
on O
in O
the O
world O
. O
But O
this O


is O
certain O
, O
that O
Amelia B-PERSON
believed O
her O
lover O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
gallant O
and O


brilliant O
men O
in O
the O
empire O
; O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
Lieutenant O
Osborne B-PERSON
thought O


so O
too O
. O


He O
was O
a O
little O
wild O
: O
how O
many O
young O
men O
are O
; O
and O
do O
n’t O
girls O
like O
a O
rake O


better O
than O
a O
milksop O
? O
He O
had O
n’t O
sown O
his O
wild O
oats O
as O
yet O
, O
but O
he O
would O


soon O
: O
and O
quit O
the O
army O
now O
that O
peace O
was O
proclaimed O
; O
the O
Corsican B-NORP
monster O


locked O
up O
at O
Elba B-PERSON
; O
promotion O
by O
consequence O
over O
; O
and O
no O
chance O
left O
for O
the O


display O
of O
his O
undoubted O
military O
talents O
and O
valour O
: O
and O
his O
allowance O
, O


with O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
settlement O
, O
would O
enable O
them O
to O
take O
a O
snug O
place O
in O
the O


country O
somewhere O
, O
in O
a O
good O
sporting O
neighbourhood O
; O
and O
he O
would O
hunt O
a O


little O
, O
and O
farm O
a O
little O
; O
and O
they O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
. O
As O
for O
remaining O
in O


the O
army O
as O
a O
married O
man O
, O
that O
was O
impossible O
. O
Fancy O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON

in O


lodgings O
in O
a O
county O

; O
or O
; O
worse O
still O

in O

East B-LOC

a O
society O
of O
officers O
, O
and O
patronised O
by O
Mrs. O
Major O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
! O
Amelia B-PERSON
died O
with O


laughing O
at O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
stories O
about O
Mrs. O
Major O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
He O
loved O
her O
much O
too O


fondly O
to O
subject O
her O
to O
that O
horrid O
woman O
and O
her O
vulgarities O
, O
and O
the O


rough O
treatment O
of O
a O
soldier O

wife O
. O
He O
did O
n’t O
care O
for O
himself O
— O
not O
he O
; O
but O


his O
dear O
little O
girl O
should O
take O
the O
place O
in O
society O
to O
which O
, O
as O
his O
wife O
, O


she O
was O
entitled O
: O
and O
to O
these O
proposals O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
she O
acceded O
, O
as O
she O


would O
to O
any O
other O

the O

Holding O
this O
kind O
of O

, O
this O

passed O
away O
a B-TIME

very O
pleasantly O
; O
and O
as O
the O
Lieutenant O
had O


only O
that O
single O
day O
in O

and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
most O
important O
business O

it O
was O
proposed O
that O
Miss O

dine O
with O
her O
future O


sisters O

in O

This O
invitation O
was O
accepted O
joyfully O
He O
conducted O
her O
to O


his O
sisters O
; O
where O
he O
left O
her O
talking O
and O
prattling O
in O
a O
way O
that O


astonished O
those O
ladies O
, O
who O
thought O
that O
George B-PERSON
might O
make O
something O
of O


her O
; O
and O
he O
then O
went O
oft O
to O
transact O
his O
business O
. O


In O
a O
word O
, O
he O
went O
out O

ate O
ices O
at O

in O
Charging B-ORG


Cross I-ORG

the O
drawing O
room O
by O
his O
daughters O
and O
the O
elegant O
Miss O


Wirt B-PERSON
, O
they O
saw O
at O
once O
by O
his O
face O
— O
which O
was O
puffy O
, O
solemn O
, O
and O
yellow O
at O


the O
best O
of O
times O
— O
and O
by O
the O
scowl O
and O
twitching O
of O
his O
black O
eye O
- O
brows O
, O


that O
the O
heart O
within O
his O
large O
white O
waistcoat O
was O
disturbed O
and O
uneasy O
. O


When O
Amelia B-PERSON
stepped O
forward O
to O
salute O
him O
, O
which O
she O
always O
did O
with O
great O


trembling O
and O
timidity O
, O
he O
gave O
a O
surly O
grunt O
of O
recognition O
, O
and O
dropped O


the O
little O
hand O
out O
of O
his O
great O
hirsute O
paw O
without O
any O
attempt O
to O
hold O
it O


there O
. O
He O
looked O
round O
gloomily O
at O
his O
eldest O
daughter O
; O
who O
, O
comprehending O


the O
meaning O
of O
his O
look O
, O
which O
asked O
unmistakably O
, O
 O
Why O
the O
devil O

she O

here O
? O
 O
said O
at O
once O
: O

the O

When O
that O

Mr. O

A O

The O

without O

over O

at O
the O

 O
What O

, O
my O

 O
asked O

as O
they O
rose O

tripped O
gingerly O
behind O
the O
sire O

 O
I O

 O
whispered O
Miss O

so O
, O
trembling O


and O
in O

, O
this O
hushed O
female O
company O
followed O
their O
dark O

. O
They O


took O
their O
places O
in O
silence O
. O
He O
growled O
out O
a O
blessing O
, O
which O
sounded O
as O


gruffly O
as O
a O
curse O
. O
The O
great O
silver O

were O
removed O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON


trembled O
in O
her O
place O
, O
for O
she O
was O
next O
to O
the O
awful O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
and O
alone O
on O


her O

of O
the O

Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
clutching O
the O

fixing O
his O

in O
a O


sepulchral O
tone O

Having O
concluded O
his O
observations O
upon O
the O

, O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
made O
a O
few O


curt O
remarks O
respecting O
the O
fish O
, O
also O
of O
a O
savage O
and O
satirical O
tendency O
, O


and O
cursed O
Billingsgate B-ORG
with O
an O
emphasis O
quite O
worthy O
of O
the O
place O
. O
Then O
he O


lapsed O
into O
silence O
, O
and O
swallowed O
sundry O
glasses O
of O
wine O
, O
looking O
more O
and O


more O
terrible O
, O
till O
a O
brisk O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
told O
of O
George B-PERSON
’s O
arrival O
, O
when O


everybody O
began O
to O
rally O
. O


 O
He O
could O
not O
come O
before O

General O

had O
kept O
him O

he O
did O
n’t O
care O


what O
. O
Capital O
mutton O
— O
capital O
everything O
. O
 O
His O
good O
humour O
contrasted O
with O


his O
father O
’s O
severity O
; O
and O
he O
rattled O
on O
unceasingly O
during O
dinner O
, O
to O
the O


delight O
of O
all O
— O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
especially O
, O
who O
need O
not O
be O
mentioned O
. O


As O
soon O
as O
the O
young O
ladies O
had O
discussed O
the O
orange O
and O
the O
glass O
of O
wine O


which O
formed O
the O
ordinary O
conclusion O
of O
the O
dismal O
banquets O
at O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O


house O
, O
the O
signal O
to O
make O
sail O
for O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
was O
given O
, O
and O
they O
all O


arose O
and O
departed O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON
hoped O
George B-PERSON
would O
soon O
join O
them O
there O
. O
She O


began O
playing O
some O
of O
his O
favourite O
waltzes O
( O
then O
newly O
imported O
) O
at O
the O


great O
carved O
- O
legged O
, O
leather O
- O
cased O
grand O
piano O
in O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
overhead O
. O


This O
little O
artifice O
did O
not O
bring O
him O
. O
He O
was O
deaf O
to O
the O
waltzes O
; O
they O


grew O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
; O
the O
discomfited O
performer O
left O
the O
huge O
instrument O


presently O
; O
and O
though O
her O
three B-CARDINAL
friends O
performed O
some O
of O
the O
loudest O
and O


most O
brilliant O
new O
pieces O
of O
their O

rèpertoire O
, O

she O
did O
not O
hear O
a O


single O
note O
, O
but O
state O
thinking O
, O
and O
boding O
evil O
. O
Old O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
scowl O
, O


terrific O
always O
, O
had O
never O
before O
looked O
so O
deadly O
to O
her O
. O
His O
eyes O
followed O


her O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
guilty O
of O
something O
. O
When O
they O


brought O
her O
coffee O
, O
she O
started O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
cup O
of O
poison O
which O
Mr. O


Hicks B-PERSON
, O
the O
butler O
, O
wished O
to O
propose O
to O
her O
. O
What O
mystery O
was O
there O
lurking O
? O


Oh O
, O
those O
women O
. O
They O
nurse O
and O
cuddle O
their O
presentiments O
, O
and O
make O


darlings O
of O
their O
ugliest O
thoughts O
, O
as O
they O
do O
of O
their O
deformed O


children O
. O


The O
gloom O
on O
the O
paternal O
countenance O
had O
also O
impressed O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON


with O
anxiety O
. O
With O
such O
eyebrows O
, O
and O
a O
look O
so O
decidedly O
bilious O
, O
how O
was O


he O
to O
extract O
that O
money O
from O
the O
governor O
, O
of O
which O
George B-PERSON
was O
consumedly O


in O
want O
? O
He O
began O
praising O
his O
father O
’s O
wine O
. O


That O
was O
generally O
a O
successful O
means O
of O
cajoling O
the O
old O
gentleman O
. O


 O
We O
never O
got O
such O
Madeira B-LOC
in O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE

, O
sir O
, O
as O

. O
Colonel O


Heavytop B-PERSON
took O
off O
three B-CARDINAL
bottles O
of O

you O
sent O
me O
down O
, O
under O
his O
belt O
the O


other O

 O


 O
Did O

 O
said O
the O
old O

 O
It O

 O


 O
Will O
you O
take O
six B-MONEY

a O
dozen O
for O
it O
, O
sir O
? O
 O
said O
George B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
. O


 O
There O
’s O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
men O
in O
the O
kingdom O
wants O
some O
. O
 O


 O
Does O
he O
? O
 O
growled O
the O
senior O
. O
 O
Wish O
he O
may O
get O
it O
. O
 O


 O
When O
General O
Daguilet O
was O
at O
Chatham B-GPE
, O
sir O
, O
Heavytop B-PERSON
gave O
him O
a O
breakfast O
, O


and O
asked O
me O
for O
some O
of O
the O
wine O
. O
The O
General O
liked O
it O
just O
as O
well O
— O
wanted O


a O
pipe O
for O
the O
Commander O
- O
in O

. O
He O
’s O
his O
Royal O
Highness O

 O


 O
It O

is O

devilish O
fine O
wine O
, O
 O
said O
the O
Eyebrows O
, O
and O
they O
looked O


more O
good O
- O
humoured O
; O
and O
George B-PERSON
was O
going O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
this O


complacency O
, O
and O
bring O
the O
supply O
question O
on O
the O
mahogany O
, O
when O
the O
father O
, O


relapsing O
into O
solemnity O
, O
though O
rather O
cordial O
in O
manner O
, O
bade O
him O
ring O
the O


bell O
for O
claret B-PERSON
. O
 O
And O
we O
’ll O
see O
if O
that O
’s O
as O
good O
as O
the O
Madeira B-GPE
, O
George B-PERSON
, O
to O


which O
his O
Royal O
Highness O
is O
welcome O
, O
I O
’m O
sure O
. O
And O
as O
we O
are O
drinking O
it O
, O


I O
’ll O
talk O
to O
you O
about O
a O
matter O
of O
importance O
. O
 O


Amelia B-PERSON
heard O
the B-FAC
claret I-FAC
bell I-FAC
ringing O
as O
she O
sat O
nervously O
upstairs O
. O
She O


thought O
, O
somehow O
, O
it O
was O
a O
mysterious O
and O
presentimental O
bell O
. O
Of O
the O


presentiments O

some O

 O
What O
I O
want O
to O
know O
, O
George B-PERSON
, O
 O
the O
old O
gentleman O
said O
, O
after O
slowly O


smacking O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
bumper—What O
I O
want O

is O
, O
how O

 O


 O

pronounced O

Whenever O
he O
met O
a O

my O

him O
as O
only O

He O
came O
home O

looked O
out O

in O

he O
introduced O

he O
bragged O
about O

his O

basked O
in O
him O
as O

George B-PERSON
was O
alarmed O

But O
the O

him O

What O

it O
that O

him O
more O

Was O
it O


that O
his O
generous O

warmed O
to O
her O
at O
the O

or O
that O


the O
idea O

him O

? O


She O
lived O
upon O

 O

Firkin B-PERSON
came O
downstairs O
in O
a O
tempest O
of O


jealousy O

only O
the O

dangerous O
because O

was O
forced O

confine O
it O

Could O
it O

the O
tempest O

 O


Rebecca B-PERSON
passed O
that O
night O
in O
constant O
watching O
upon O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
; O
the O
next O


night O
the O
old O
lady O
slept O
so O
comfortably O
, O
that O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
time O
for O
several B-TIME


hours I-TIME
’ O
comfortably O
, O
repose O
herself O
on O
the O
sofa O
, O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
her O


patroness O
’s O
bed O
; O
very O
soon O
, O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O
so O
well O
that O
she O
sat O
up O
and O


laughed O
heartily O
at O
a O
perfect O
imitation O
of O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
and O
her O
grief O
, O
which O


Rebecca B-PERSON
described O
to O
her O
. O
Briggs B-PERSON
’ O
weeping O
snuffle O
, O
and O
her O
manner O
of O
using O


the O
handkerchief O
, O
were O
so O
completely O
rendered O
, O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
became O


quite O
cheerful O
, O
to O
the O
admiration O
of O
the O
doctors O
when O
they O
visited O
her O
, O
who O


usually O
found O
this O
worthy O
woman O
of O
the O
world O
, O
when O
the O
least O
sickness O


attacked O
her O
, O
under O
the O
most O
abject O
depression O
and O
terror O
of O
death O
. O


Captain O
Crawley B-PERSON
came O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
received O
bulletins O
from O
Miss O
Rebecca B-PERSON


respecting O
his O
aunt O
’s O
health O
. O
This O
improved O
so O
rapidly O
, O
that O
poor O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O


allowed O
to O
see O
her O
patroness O
; O
and O
persons O
with O
tender O
hearts O
may O
imagine O
the O


smothered O
emotions O
of O
that O
sentimental O
female O
, O
and O
the O
affecting O
nature O
of O


the O
interview O
. O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
liked O
to O
have O
Briggs B-PERSON
in O
a O
good O
deal O
soon O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
used O
to O


mimic O
her O
to O
her O
face O
with O
the O
most O
admirable O
gravity O
, O
thereby O
rendering O
the O


imitation O
doubly O
piquant O
to O
her O
worthy O
patroness O
. O


The O
causes O
which O
had O
led O
to O
the O
deplorable O
illness O
of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
and O
her O


departure O
from O
her O
brother O
’s O
house O
in O
the O
country O
, O
were O
of O
such O
an O


unromantic O
nature O
that O
they O
are O
hardly O
fit O
to O
be O
explained O
in O
this O
genteel O


and O
sentimental O
novel O
. O
For O
how O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
hint O
of O
a O
delicate O
female O
, O


living O
in O
good O
society O
, O
that O
she O
ate O
and O
drank O
too O
much O
, O
and O
that O
a O
hot O


supper O
of O
lobsters O
profusely O
enjoyed O
at O
the O
Rectory B-PERSON
was O
the O
reason O
of O
an O


indisposition O
which O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
herself O
persisted O
was O
solely O
attributable O


to O
the O
dampness O
of O
the O
weather O
? O
The O
attack O
was O
so O
sharp O
that O
Matilda B-ORG
— O
as O
his O


Reverence O
expressed O
it O
— O
was O
very O
nearly O
 O
off O
the O
hooks O
; O
 O
all O
the O
family O
were O


in O
a O
fever O
of O
expectation O
regarding O
the O
will O
, O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
was O
making O


sure O
of O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
forty O
thousand O
pounds O
before O
the O
commencement O
of O
the O
London B-GPE


season O
. O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
sent O
over O
a O
choice O
parcel O
of O
tracts O
, O
to O
prepare O
her O
for O


the O
change O
from O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG
and O
Park B-GPE
Lane I-GPE
for O
another O
world O
; O
but O
a O
good O


doctor O
from O
Southampton B-GPE
being O
called O
in O
in O
time O
, O
vanquished O
the O
lobster O


which O
was O
no O
nearly O
fatal O
to O
her O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
sufficient O
strength O
to O
enable O


her O
to O
return O
to O
London B-GPE
. O
The O
Baronet O
did O
not O
disguise O
his O
exceeding O


mortification O
at O
the O
turn O
which O
affairs O
took O
. O


While O
everybody O
was O
attending O
on O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
and O
messengers O
every B-TIME
hour I-TIME


from O
the O
Rectory O
were O
carrying O
news O
of O
her O
health O
to O
the O
affectionate O
folks O


there O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lady O
in O
another O
part O
of O
the O
house O
, O
being O
exceedingly O
ill O
, O


of O
whom O
no O
one O
took O
any O
notice O
at O
all O
; O
and O
this O
was O
the O
lady O
of O
Crawley B-GPE


herself O
. O
The O
good O
doctor O
shook O
his O
head O
after O
seeing O
her O
; O
to O
which O
visit O
Sir O


Pitt B-PERSON
consented O
, O
as O
it O
could O
be O
paid O
without O
a O
fee O
; O
and O
she O
was O
left O
fading O


away O
in O
her O
lonely O
chamber O
, O
with O
no O
more O
heed O
paid O
to O
her O
than O
to O
a O
weed O
in O


the O
park O
. O


The O
young O
ladies O
, O
too O
, O
lost O
much O
of O
the O
inestimable O
benefit O
of O
their O


governess O
’s O
instruction O
. O
So O
affectionate O
a O
nurse O
was O
Miss B-PERSON
Sharp I-PERSON
, O
that O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
would O
take O
her O
medicines O
from O
no O
other O
hand O
. O
Firkin B-PERSON
had O
been O
deposed O


long O
before O
her O
mistress O
’s O
departure O
from O
the O
country O
. O
That O
faithful O


attendant O
found O
a O
gloomy O
consolation O
on O
returning O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
in O
seeing O
Miss O


Briggs B-PERSON
suffer O
the O
same O
pangs O
of O
jealousy O
and O
undergo O
the O
same O
faithless O


treatment O
to O
which O
she O
herself O
had O
been O
subject O
. O


Captain O
Rawdon B-PERSON
got O
an O
extension O
of O
leave O
on O
his O
aunt O

illness O
, O
and O


remained O
dutifully O
at O
home O

He O
was O
always O
in O
her O

( O
She O
lay O
sick O


in O

you O
entered O
by O
the O
little O

His O

was O
always O
meeting O
him O
there O
; O
or O
if O
he O
came O
down O
the O
corridor O


ever O
so O
quietly O
his O
father O

door O
was O
sure O
to O
open O
, O
and O
the O
hyæna O
face O
of O


the O
old O

to O
glare O
out O

What O
was O
it O
set O

? O
A O


generous O

no O

to O

should O
be O
most O
attentive O
to O
the O
dear O


sufferer O
in O
the O
state O

Rebecca B-PERSON
used O
to O
come O
out O
and O
comfort O
both O
of O


them O
; O
or O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
the O
other O
of O
them O
rather O
. O
Both O
of O
these O
worthy O
gentlemen O


were O
most O
anxious O
to O
have O
news O
of O
the O
invalid O
from O
her O
little O
confidential O


messenger O
. O


At O
dinner O
— O
to O
which O
meal O
she O
descended O
for O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
— O
she O
kept O
the O
peace O


between O
them O
: O
after O
which O
she O
disappeared O
for O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
; O
when O
Rawdon B-PERSON
would O


ride O
over O
to O
the O
depôt O
of O
the O
150th O
at O
Mudbury B-ORG
, O
leaving O
his O
Papa O
to O
the O


society O
of O
Mr. O
Horrocks B-PERSON
and O
his O
rum O
and O
water O
. O
She O
passed O
as O
weary O
a O


fortnight O
as O
ever O
mortal O
spent O
in O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
sick O
- O
room O
; O
but O
her O
little O


nerves O
seemed O
to O
be O
of O
iron O
, O
as O
she O
was O
quite O
unshaken O
by O
the O
duty O
and O
the O


tedium O
of O
the O
sick O
- O
chamber O
. O


She O
never O
told O
until O
long O
afterwards O
how O
painful O
that O
duty O
was O
; O
how O
peevish O


a O
patient O
was O
the O
jovial O
old O
lady O
; O
how O
angry O
; O
how O
sleepless O
; O
in O
what O
horrors O


of O
death O
; O
during O
what O
long O
nights O
she O
lay O
moaning O
, O
and O
in O
almost O
delirious O


agonies O
respecting O
that O
future O
world O
which O
she O
quite O
ignored O
when O
she O
was O
in O


good O
health.—Picture O

a O

Sharp B-PERSON
watched O
this O
graceless O
bedside O
with O
indomitable O
patience O
. O
Nothing O


escaped O
her O
; O
and O
, O
like O
a O
prudent O
steward O
, O
she O
found O
a O
use O
for O
everything O
. O


She O
told O
many O
a O
good O
story O
about O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
illness O
in O
after O


days,—stories O
which O
made O
the O
lady O
blush O
through O
her O
artificial O
carnations O
. O


During O
the O
illness O
she O
was O
never O
out O
of O
temper O
; O
always O
alert O
; O
she O
slept O


light O
, O
having O
a O
perfectly O
clear O
conscience O
; O
and O
could O
take O
that O
refreshment O


at O
almost B-TIME
any I-TIME
minute I-TIME
’s O
warning O
. O
And O
so O
you O
saw O
very O
few O
traces O
of O
fatigue O
in O


her O
appearance O
. O
Her O
face O
might O
be O
a O
trifle O
paler O
, O
and O
the O
circles O
round O
her O


eyes O
a O
little O
blacker O
than O
usual O
; O
but O
whenever O
she O
came O
out O
from O
the O


sick O
- O
room O
she O
was O
always O
smiling O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
neat O
, O
and O
looked O
as O
trim O
in O
her O


little O
dressing O
- O
gown O
and O
cap O
, O
as O
in O
her O
smartest O
evening B-TIME
suit O
. O


The O
Captain O
thought O
so O
, O
and O
raved O
about O
her O
in O
uncouth O
convulsions O
. O
The O


barbed O
shaft O
of O
love O
had O
penetrated O
his O
dull O
hide O
. O
Six B-DATE

victimised O
him O

He O

a O


confidante O
of O
his O
aunt O
at O
the O
Rectory O
, O
of O
all O
persons O
in O
the O
world O
. O
She O


rallied O
him O
about O
it O
; O
she O
had O
perceived O
his O
folly O
; O
she O
warned O
him O
; O
she O


finished O
by O
owning O
that O
little O
Sharp B-PERSON
was O
the O
most O
clever O

droll O
, O
odd O
, O


good O
- O
natured O

simple O
, O
kindly O

Rawdon B-PERSON

not O

though O
— O
dear O
Miss O

would O
never O
pardon O
him O
for O


that O
; O
for O
she O
, O
too O
, O
was O
quite O
overcome O
by O
the O
little O
governess O

and O
loved O


Sharp B-PERSON
like O
a O

Rawdon B-PERSON
must O
go O
away O

go O
back O
to O
his O
regiment O
and O


naughty O
London B-GPE
and O
not O
play O
with O
a O

compassionating O
the O
forlorn O

of O
walking O

A O

 O


Rawdon B-PERSON

He O

His O

a O
more O

whyou O
— O
he O
did O
not O

the O


sentence O

walked O
home O

to O
Mrs. O

 O
By O
Jove B-PERSON
, O
it O

too O
bad O
, O
 O
thought O
Rawdon B-PERSON

 O
too O
bad O
, O
by O
Jove B-PERSON
! O
I O
do O
believe O


the O
woman O
wants O
the O

ruined O

in O
order O
that O
she O
should O
n’t O
come O


into O
the O
family O
as O
Lady O
Crawley B-PERSON

 O


When O
he O
saw O
Rebecca B-PERSON
alone O
, O
he O
rallied O
her O
about O
his O
father O
’s O
attachment O
in O


his O
graceful O
way O
. O
She O
flung O
up O
her O
head O
scornfully O
, O
looked O
him O
full O
in O
the O


face O
, O
and O
said O
, O
— O


 O
Well O
, O
suppose O
he O

is O

fond O
of O
me O

I O
know O
he O

You O

You O
do O

I O

defend O
my O

 O
said O
the O
little O

looking O

 O
O O

 O
You O

 O

Miss O

 O
the O

 O
Do O
you O
suppose O
I O
have O
no O
feeling O

I O

poor O

Do O
you O

because O
I O

a O


governess O
, O
I O
have O
not O

much O
sense O

feeling O

and O
good O

you O


gentlefolks O

I O

Do O
you O
suppose O
a O
Montmorency B-GPE

not O
as O

 O


When O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
was O
agitated O
, O
and O
alluded O
to O
her O
maternal O
relatives O
, O
she O


spoke O
with O
ever O
so O
slight O
a O
foreign O
accent O
, O
which O
gave O
a O
great O
charm O
to O
her O


clear O
ringing O
voice O
. O
 O
No O
, O
 O
she O
continued O
, O
kindling O
as O
she O
spoke O
to O
the O


Captain O
; O
 O
I O
can O
endure O
poverty O
, O
but O
not O
shame O

neglect O

but O
not O
insult O
; O
and O


insult O
from O

from O

you O

 O


Her O
feelings O
gave O
way O

she O
burst O
into O
tears O

 O
Hang O

Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON

Rebecca B-PERSON

I O
would O

for O
a O


thousand O

Stop O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
! O
 O


She O
was O
gone O
. O
She O
drove O
out O
with O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
It O
was O
before O
the O


latter O
’s O
illness O
. O
At O
dinner O
she O
was O
unusually O
brilliant O
and O
lively O
; O
but O
she O


would O
take O
no O
notice O
of O
the O
hints O
, O
or O
the O
nods O
, O
or O
the O
clumsy O
expostulations O


of O
the O
humiliated O
, O
infatuated O
guardsman O
. O
Skirmishes O
of O
this O
sort O
passed O


perpetually O
during O
the O
little O
campaign O
— O
tedious O
to O
relate O
, O
and O
similar O
in O


result O
. O
The O
Crawley B-GPE
heavy O
cavalry O
was O
maddened O
by O
defeat O
, O
and O
routed O
every O


day O
. O


If O
the O
Baronet O
of O
Queen O
’s O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
not O
had O
the O
fear O
of O
losing O
his O


sister O
’s O
legacy O
before O
his O
eyes O
, O
he O
never O
would O
have O
permitted O
his O
dear O


girls O
to O
lose O
the O
educational O
blessings O
which O
their O
invaluable O
governess O
was O


conferring O
upon O
them O
. O
The O
old O
house O
at O
home O
seemed O
a O
desert O
without O
her O
, O
so O


useful O
and O
pleasant O
had O
Rebecca B-PERSON
made O
herself O
there O
. O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
letters O
were O


not O
copied O
and O
corrected O
; O
his O
books O
not O
made O
up O
; O
his O
household O
business O
and O


manifold O
schemes O
neglected O
, O
now O
that O
his O
little O
secretary O
was O
away O
. O
And O
it O


was O
easy O
to O
see O
how O
necessary O
such O
an O
amanuensis O
was O
to O
him O
, O
by O
the O
tenor O


and O
spelling O
of O
the O
numerous O
letters O
which O
he O
sent O
to O
her O
, O
entreating O
her O


and O
commanding O
her O
to O
return O
. O
Almost B-DATE
every I-DATE
day I-DATE
brought O
a O
frank O
from O
the O


Baronet O
, O
enclosing O
the O
most O
urgent O
prayers O
to O
Becky B-PERSON
for O
her O
return O

or O


conveying O
pathetic O
statements O
to O
Miss O

regarding O
the O
neglected O
state O


of O
his O
daughters O
’ O
education O
; O
of O
which O
documents O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
took O
very O


little O
heed O
. O


Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O
not O
formally O
dismissed O
, O
but O
her O
place O
as O
companion O
was O
a O


sinecure O
and O
a O
derision O
; O
and O
her O
company O
was O
the O
fat O
spaniel O
in O
the O


drawing O

room O
, O
or O
occasionally O
the O
discontended O
Firkin B-PERSON
in O
the O
housekeeper O

closet O

Nor O
though O
the O
old O
lady O
would O
by O
no O

hear O
of O
Rebecca B-PERSON

departure O
, O
was O
the O
latter O
regularly O
installed O
in O
office O
in O
Park B-GPE
Lane I-GPE
. O
Like O


many O
wealthy O
people O
, O
it O
was O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
habit O
to O
accept O
as O
much O
service O


as O
she O
could O
get O
from O
her O
inferiors O
; O
and O
good O
- O
naturedly O
to O
take O
leave O
of O


them O
when O
she O
no O
longer O
found O
them O
useful O
. O
Gratitude O
among O
certain O
rich O


folks O
is O
scarcely O
natural O
or O
to O
be O
thought O
of O
. O
They O
take O
needy O
people O
’s O


services O
as O
their O
due O
. O
Nor O
have O
you O
, O
O O
poor O
parasite O
and O
humble O
hanger O
- O
on O
, O


much O
reason O
to O
complain O
! O
Your O
friendship O
for O
Dives O
is O
about O
as O
sincere O
as O


the O
return O
which O
it O
usually O
gets O
. O
It O
is O
money O
you O
love O
, O
and O
not O
the O
man O
; O
and O


were O
Crœsus B-PERSON

his O
footman O

you O
know O
, O
you O
poor O
rogue O

who O


would O
have O
the O
benefit O
of O
your O
allegiance O

And O
I O
am O
not O
sure O

that O
, O
in O

of O
Rebecca B-PERSON

simplicity O
and O
activity O

gentleness O

untiring O
good O

the O
shrewd O
old O
London B-GPE
lady O
, O
upon O
whom O


these O
treasures O
of O

were O
lavished O
, O
had O
not O
a O
lurking O
suspicion O
all O


the O
while O
of O
her O
affectionate O
nurse O
and O
friend O
. O
It O
must O
have O
often O
crossed O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
mind O
that O
nobody O
does O
anything O
for O
nothing O
. O
If O
she O
measured O


her O
own O
feeling O
towards O
the O
world O
, O
she O
must O
have O
been O
pretty O
well O
able O
to O


gauge O
those O
of O
the O
world O
, O
towards O
herself O
; O
and O
perhaps O
she O
reflected O
, O
that O


it O
is O
the O
ordinary O
lot O
of O
people O
to O
have O
no O
friends O
if O
they O
themselves O
care O


for O
nobody O
. O


Well O
, O
meanwhile O
Becky B-PERSON
was O
the O
greatest O
comfort O
and O
convenience O
to O
her O
, O
and O


she O
gave O
her O
a O
couple O
of O
new O
gowns O
, O
and O
an O
old O
necklace O
and O
shawl O
, O
and O


showed O
her O
friendship O
by O
abusing O
all O
her O
intimate O
acquaintances O
to O
her O
new O


confidante O
( O
than O
which O
there O
ca O
n’t O
be O
a O
more O
touching O
proof O
of O
regard O
) O
, O
and O


meditated O
vaguely O
some O
great O
future O
benefit O
— O
to O
marry O
her O
perhaps O
to O
Clump B-ORG
, O


the O
apothecary O
, O
or O
to O
settle O
her O
in O
some O
advantageous O
way O
of O

; O
or O
at O
any O


rate O
, O
to O
send O
her O
back O
to O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-PERSON
when O

done O
with O
her O

the O

When O

Becky B-PERSON


sang O

her O

when O

well O
enough O
to O

out O

Becky B-PERSON
accompanied O

of O

did O
Miss O

 O
My O

 O
At O

 O
You O

We O

then O
I O

 O


Osborne B-PERSON

The O

a O
pretext O
for O


backing O
out O

How O

 O


Thus O
was O
George B-PERSON
utterly O

Not O
that O
Rebecca B-PERSON

she O

he O

Though O

in O

with O
every O

Miss O

was O
made O
acquainted O
before O
twenty B-TIME

four I-TIME

They O
added O
to O
her O
original O
regard O
for O
Mr. O

Her O
woman O

instinct O
had O
told O
her O

had O
interrupted O
the O

her O

George B-PERSON
went O
off O

He O
told O

 O
Your O

to O

Lieutenant O

For O

 O


Rebecca B-PERSON

When O

to O
some O
of O


his O
innumerable O

He O
had O
found O


time O

to O
call O
often O
in O

and O
to O
despatch O

to O
Rebecca B-PERSON

commanding O
her O

young O

who O
were O
now O
utterly O
without O

But O
Miss O

would O
not O
hear O
of O
her O


departure O

for O

there O
was O
no O
lady O
of O

London B-GPE
who O
would O


desert O
her O

more O

The O

might O

Miss O

 O
I O
suppose O
I O
must O


put O
off O
my O

for O
the B-DATE
3rd I-DATE

 O
Miss O

said O

added O

after O
a O
pause O

 O
I O
hope O
my O

have O
the O
decency O
not O
to O

 O
 O
What O
a O


confounded O
rage O
Pitt B-PERSON

be O
in O

 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
remarked O
, O
with O
his O
usual O


regard O
for O
his O
elder O
brother O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
nothing O
. O
She O
seemed O
by O
far O
the O


gravest O
and O
most O
impressed O
of O
the O
family O
. O
She O
left O
the O
room O
before O
Rawdon B-PERSON


went O
away O
that B-DATE

they O
met O
by O

On O
the O

out O

up O

reading O


the O

 O
It O

Sir O

with O
a O
coolness O
and O
good O

humour O
which O
set O


Miss O

almost O
mad O
with O
bewilderment O

should O
fall O
on O
his O

to O
a O
penniless O

The O

to O
their O

’ O
content O
at O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON

, O
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON

refusal O
; O
Briggs B-PERSON
very O
acutely O
suggesting O
that O
there O
must O
have O
been O
some O


obstacle O
in O
the O

of O
a O

otherwise O
no O
young O

her O

 O
You O

accepted O
it O
yourself O
, O
would O
n’t O
you O
, O
Briggs B-PERSON
? O
 O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON


said O
, O
kindly O
. O


 O
Would O
it O
not O
be O
a O
privilege O
to O
be O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
sister O
? O
 O
Briggs B-PERSON
replied O
, O


with O
meek O
evasion O
. O


 O
Well O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
would O
have O
made O
a O
good O
Lady O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
after O
all O
, O
 O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON


remarked O
( O
who O
was O
mollified O
by O
the O
girl O
’s O
refusal O
, O
and O
very O
liberal O
and O


generous O
now O
there O
was O
no O
call O
for O
her O
sacrifices O
) O
. O
 O
She O
has O
brains O
in O


plenty O
( O
much O
more O
wit O
in O
her O
little O
finger O
than O
you O
have O
, O
my O
poor O
dear O


Briggs B-PERSON
, O
in O
all O
your O
head O
) O
. O
Her O
manners O
are O
excellent O
, O
now O
I O
have O
formed O
her O
. O


She O
is O
a O
Montmorency B-GPE
, O
Briggs B-ORG
, O
and O
blood O

is O

something O
, O
though O
I O


despise O
it O
for O
my O
part O
; O
and O
she O
would O
have O
held O
her O
own O
amongst O
those O


pompous O
stupid O
Hampshire B-GPE
people O
much O
better O
than O
that O
unfortunate O


ironmonger O
’s O
daughter O
. O
 O


Briggs B-PERSON
coincided O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
the O
 O
previous O
attachment O
 O
was O
then O
discussed O


in O
conjectures O
. O
 O
You O
poor O
friendless O
creatures O
are O
always O
having O
some O


foolish O

tendre O
, O
 O

Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
said O
. O
 O
You O
yourself O
, O
you O

, O
were O


in O

with O
a O

master O
( O
do O

cry O
, O
Briggs B-PERSON
— O
you’re O
always O
crying O
, O
and O


it O
wo O
n’t O
bring O
him O
to O
life O
again O
) O
, O
and O
I O
suppose O
this O
unfortunate O
Becky B-PERSON
has O


been O
silly O
and O
sentimental O
too O
— O
some O
apothecary O
, O
or O
house O
- O
steward O
, O
or O


painter O
, O
or O
young O
curate O
, O
or O
something O
of O
that O
sort O
. O
 O


 O
Poor O
thing O
, O
poor O

! O
 O
says O
Briggs B-PERSON
( O
who O
was O
thinking O
of O
twenty B-CARDINAL

years O

and O
that O

writing O

and O
whose O

beautiful O
in O
their O

cherished O
in O
her O

. O
 O
Poor O
thing O
, O
poor O
thing O
! O
 O
says O

Once O
more O
she O
was O
a O


fresh O
- O
cheeked O
lass O
of O
eighteen B-CARDINAL
; O
she O
was O
at O
evening B-TIME
church O
, O
and O
the O
hectic O


writing O
- O
master O
and O
she O
were O
quavering O
out O
of O
the O

psalm O
- O
book O
. O


 O
After O
such O
conduct O
on O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
part O
, O
 O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
said O
enthusiastically O
, O


 O
our O

something O

Find O

who O
is O
the O

objet O
, O

. O
 O


Briggs B-PERSON
declared O
that O
it O
would O
be O
delightful O
, O
and O
vowed O
that O
her O
dear O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
was O
always O
kind O
and O
generous O
, O
and O
went O
up O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
bed O
- O
room O
to O


console O
her O
and O
prattle O
about O
the O
offer O
, O
and O
the O

, O
and O
the O

thereof O
; O
and O
to O
hint O
at O
the O

intentions O
of O
Miss O

, O
and O
to O

out O
who O
was O
the O
gentleman O
that O
had O
the O
mastery O
of O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
’s O
heart O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
very O
kind O
, O
very O
affectionate O
and O
affected O
— O
responded O
to O
Brigg B-ORG
’s O


offer O
of O
tenderness O
with O
grateful O
fervour O
— O
owned O
there O
was O
a O
secret O


attachment O
— O
a O
delicious O
mystery O
— O
what O
a O
pity O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
had O
not O
remained O
half B-TIME


a I-TIME
minute I-TIME
longer O
at O
the O
key O
- O
hole O
! O
Rebecca B-PERSON
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
told O
more O
: O
but O


five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
after O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
’s O
arrival O
in O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
apartment O
, O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
actually O
made O
her O
appearance O
there O
— O
an O
unheard O
- O
of O
honour;—her O


impatience O
had O
overcome O
her O
; O
she O
could O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
tardy O
operations O
of O


her O
ambassadress O
: O
so O
she O
came O
in O
person O
, O
and O
ordered O
Briggs B-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O


And O
expressing O
her O
approval O
of O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
conduct O
, O
she O
asked O
particulars O
of O


the O
interview O
, O
and O
the O
previous O
transactions O
which O
had O
brought O
about O
the O


astonishing O
offer O
of O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
she O
had O
long O
had O
some O
notion O
of O
the O
partiality O
with O
which O
Sir O


Pitt B-PERSON
honoured O
her O
, O
( O
for O
he O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
making O
his O
feelings O
known O
in O


a O
very O
frank O
and O
unreserved O
manner O
, O
) O
but O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
private O
reasons O


with O
which O
she O
would O
not O
for O
the O
present O
trouble O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O


age O
, O
station O
, O
and O
habits O
were O
such O
as O
to O
render O
a O
marriage O
quite O
impossible O
; O


and O
could O
a O
woman O
with O
any O
feeling O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
and O
any O
decency O
listen O
to O


proposals O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
, O
when O
the O
funeral O
of O
the O
lover O
’s O
deceased O
wife O


had O
not O
actually O
taken O
place O
? O


 O
Nonsense O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
would O
never O
have O
refused O
him O
had O
there O
not O
been O


some O
one O
else O
in O
the O
case O
, O
 O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
said O
, O
coming O
to O
her O
point O
at O
once O
. O


 O
Tell O
me O
the O
private O
reasons O
; O
what O
are O
the O
private O
reasons O
? O
There O


is O

some O
one O
; O
who O
is O
it O
that O
has O
touched O
your O
heart O
? O
 O


Rebecca B-PERSON
cast O
down O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
owned O
there O
was O
. O
 O
You O
have O
guessed O
right O
, O


dear O
lady O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
sweet O
simple O
faltering O
voice O
. O
 O
You O
wonder O
at O


one O
so O
poor O
and O
friendless O
having O
an O
attachment O
, O
do O
n’t O
you O
? O
I O
have O
never O


heard O
that O
poverty O
was O
any O
safeguard O
against O
it O
. O
I O
wish O
it O
were O
. O
 O


 O
My O
poor O
dear O
child O
, O
 O
cried O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
always O
quite O
ready O
to O
be O


sentimental O
, O
 O
is O
our O
passion O
unrequited O
, O
then O
? O
Are O
we O
pining O
in O

? O
Tell O


me O
all O

me O
console O
you O

 O


 O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
, O
dear O
Madam O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
in O
the O
same O
tearful O
tone O
. O


 O
Indeed O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
need O
it O
. O
 O
And O
she O
laid O
her O
head O
upon O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O


shoulder O
and O
wept O
there O
so O
naturally O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
surprised O
into O


sympathy O
, O
embraced O
her O
with O
an O
almost O
maternal O
kindness O
, O
uttered O
many O


soothing O
protests O
of O
regard O
and O
affection O
for O
her O
, O
vowed O
that O
she O
loved O
her O


as O
a O

, O
and O
would O
do O
everything O
in O
her O
power O
to O
serve O
her O
. O
 O
And O
now O
, O


who O
is O
it O
, O
my O

? O
Is O
it O
that O
pretty O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON

brother O
? O
You O
said O


something O
about O

with O
him O

I O
’ll O
ask O
him O
here O

my O

And O
you O

him O
: O
indeed O
you O

 O


 O
Do O

me O
now O

 O
Rebecca B-PERSON

 O
You O

Dear O

Miss O

 O


 O
That O
you O

my O

 O
the O

 O
I O

 O

out O
Rebecca B-PERSON

 O
I O

But O
O O

love O
me O
always O

you O
will O

 O
And O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
mutual O


tears O
— O
for O
the O
emotions O
of O
the O
younger O
woman O
had O
awakened O
the O
sympathies O
of O


the O
elder O
— O
this O
promise O
was O
solemnly O
given O
by O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
who O
left O
her O


little O

protégée O

blessing O
and O
admiring O
her O
as O
a O
dear O
, O
artless O
, O


tender O

hearted O
, O
affectionate O
, O
incomprehensible O
creature O
. O


And O
now O
she O
was O
left O
alone O
to O
think O
over O
the O
sudden O
and O
wonderful O
events O
of O


the B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
of O
what O
had O
been O

what O

What O
think O
you O
were O


the O
private O
feelings O
of O
Miss O

no O
( O
begging O
her O
pardon O
) O
of O
Mrs. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
? O
If O
, O
a O


few O
pages O
back O
, O
the O
present O
writer O
claimed O
the O
privilege O
of O
peeping O
into O


Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON

bedroom O
, O
and O
understanding O
with O
the O

novelist O
all O
the O
gentle O

which O
were O
tossing O

Rebecca B-PERSON

conscience O

Well O
, O
then O
, O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
gave O
way O
to O
some O
very O
sincere O
and O


touching O
regrets O
that O
a O
piece O
of O
marvellous O
good O
fortune O
should O
have O
been O
so O


near O
her O

and O
she O
actually O
obliged O
to O
decline O
it O

In O
this O
natural O
emotion O


every O
properly O
regulated O
mind O
will O
certainly O
share O

What O
good O
mother O
is O


there O
that O

not O
commiserate O
a O

who O

not O

ingenious O

who O
gets O
such O
an O

just O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
it O

out O
of O
her O

accept O
it O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
our O
friend O
Becky B-PERSON

disappointment O
deserves O
and O
will O


command O
every O
sympathy O

I O
remember O
one B-TIME

being O
in O

at O
an O

I O


observed O

out O

the O

, O
as O
we O
all O

What O
, O
I O
asked O
in O
my O
own O
mind O
, O
can O
cause O
this O
obsequiousness O
on O
the O
part O
of O


Miss O
Toady B-PERSON

has O

a O

her O

Miss O

explained O
presently O
, O
with O
that O
simplicity O
which O


distinguishes O
all O
her O

. O
 O
You O
know O
, O
 O
she O
said O

 O
Mrs. O

 O

Toady B-PERSON
asked O
Briefless B-PERSON

his O

If O
the O

procure O
a O

such O


homage O
in O
the O

surely O
, O
surely O
we O

respect O
the O

of O
a O

lost O
the O

Rebecca B-PERSON
thought O
to O

in O


all O

I O
might O

my O

I O
might O

Mr. O

now O
— O
now O
all O


was O
doubt O
and O
mystery O
. O


But O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
too O
much O
resolution O
and O
energy O
of O
character O


to O
permit O
herself O
much O
useless O
and O
unseemly O
sorrow O
for O
the O
irrevocable O
past O
; O


so O
, O
having O
devoted O
only O
the O
proper O
portion O
of O
regret O
to O
it O
, O
she O
wisely O


turned O
her O
whole O
attention O
towards O
the O
future O
, O
which O
was O
now O
vastly O
more O


important O
to O
her O
. O
And O
she O
surveyed O
her O
position O
, O
and O
its O
hopes O
, O
doubts O
, O
and O


chances O
. O


In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
she O
was O

married O
; O

— O
that O
was O
a O
great O
fact O
. O
Sir O


Pitt B-PERSON
knew O
it O
. O
She O
was O
not O
so O
much O
surprised O
into O
the O
avowal O
, O
as O
induced O
to O


make O
it O
by O
a O
sudden O
calculation O
. O
It O
must O
have O
come O
some B-DATE
day I-DATE
: O
and O
why O
not O
now O


as O
at O
a O
later O
period O
? O
He O
who O
would O
have O
married O
her O
himself O
must O
at O
least O
be O


silent O
with O
regard O
to O
her O
marriage O
. O
How O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
would O
bear O
the O
news O
— O
was O


the O
great O
question O
. O
Misgivings B-PERSON
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
; O
but O
she O
remembered O
all O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
had O
said O
; O
the O
old O
lady O
’s O
avowed O
contempt O
for O
birth O
; O
her O
daring O


liberal O
opinions O
; O
her O
general O
romantic O
propensities O
; O
her O
almost O
doting O


attachment O
to O
her O
nephew O
, O
and O
her O
repeatedly O
- O
expressed O
fondness O
for O
Rebecca B-PERSON


herself O
. O
She O
is O
so O
fond O
of O
him O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
thought O
, O
that O
she O
will O
forgive O
him O


anythin O
she O
is O
so O
used O
to O
me O
that O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
she O
could O
be O
comfortable O


without O
me O
: O
when O
the O

éclaircissement O

comes O
there O
will O
be O
a O
scene O
, O


and O
hysterics O
, O
and O
a O
great O
quarrel O
, O
and O
then O
a O
great O
reconciliation O
. O
At O
all O


events O
, O
what O
use O
was O
there O
in O
delaying O
? O
the O
die O
was O
thrown O
, O
and O
now O
or O


to O
- O
morrow B-DATE
the O
issue O
must O
be O
the O
same O
. O
And O
so O
, O
resolved O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON


should O
have O
the O
news O
, O
the O
young O
person O
debated O
in O
her O
mind O
as O
to O
the O
best O


means O
of O
conveying O
it O
to O
her O
; O
and O
whether O
she O
should O
face O
the O
storm O
that O


must O
come O
, O
or O
fly O
and O
avoid O
it O
until O
its O
first B-ORDINAL
fury O
was O
blown O
over O
. O
In O
this O


state O
of O
meditation O
she O
wrote O
the O
following O
letter O
: O
— O

Dearest O


Friend,—The O
great O
crisis O
which O
we O
have O
debated O
about O
so O
often O
is O


come O
. O

Half B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
secret O
is O
known O
, O
and O
I O
have O
thought O


and O
thought O
, O
until O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
that O
now O
is O
the O
time O
to O
reveal O


the O
whole O
of O
the O
mystery O
. O

Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
came O
to O
me O
this O


morning B-TIME
, O
and O
made O
— O
what O
do O
you O
think O
? O
— O

a O
declaration O
in O
form O
. O


Think O
of O
that O
! O
Poor O
little O
me O
. O
I O
might O
have O
been O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
. O
How O


pleased O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
and O

ma B-PERSON
tante I-PERSON

if O
I O
had O


taken O
precedence O
of O
her O
. O
I O
might O
have O
been O
somebody O
’s O
mamma O
, O
instead O


of O
— O
O O
, O
I O
tremble O
, O
I O
tremble O
, O
when O
I O
think O
how O
soon O
we O
must O
tell O


all O
! O
— O

Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
knows O
I O
am O
married O
, O
and O
not O
knowing O
to O
whom O
, O


is O
not O
very O
much O
displeased O
as O
yet O
. O

Ma B-PERSON
tante I-PERSON
is O
actually O


angry O

that O
I O
should O
have O
refused O
him O
. O
But O
she O
is O
all O


kindness O
and O
graciousness O
. O
She O
condescends O
to O
say O
I O
would O
have O
made O


him O
a O
good O
wife O
; O
and O
vows O
that O
she O
will O
be O
a O
mother O
to O
your O
little O


Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
She O
will O
be O
shaken O
when O
she O
first B-ORDINAL
hears O
the O
news O
. O
But O
need O


we O
fear O
anything O
beyond O
a O
momentary O
anger O
? O
I O
think O
not O
: O

I O
am O


sure O

not O
. O
She O
dotes O
upon O
you O
so O
( O
you O
naughty O
, O


good O
- O
for O
- O
nothing O
man O
) O
, O
that O
she O
would O
pardon O
you O

anythin O


and O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
the O
next O
place O
in O
her O
heart O
is O
mine O
: O
and O


that O
she O
would O
be O
miserable O
without O
me O
. O
Dearest O
! O
something O

tells O


me O

we O
shall O
conquer O
. O
You O
shall O
leave O
that O
odious O
regiment O
: O


quit O
gaming O
, O
racing O
, O
and O

be O
a O
good O
boy O
; O

and O
we O
shall O
all O


live O
in O
Park B-GPE
Lane I-GPE
, O
and O

ma B-PERSON

shall O
leave O
us O
all O
her O


money O

I O
shall O
try O
and O
walk O
to O
- O
morrow B-DATE
at O
3 B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
usual O


place O
. O
If O
Miss O
B. B-PERSON
accompanies O
me O
, O
you O
must O
come O
to O
dinner O
, O
and O
bring O


an O
answer O
, O
and O
put O
it O
in O
the O
third B-ORDINAL

that O
the O

The O
Letter O
on O

HOW O

is O
not O
of O

that O
if O
a O

has O

, O
she O
will O
assuredly O
find O
a O


way?—My O
belief O
is O
, O
that O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE

when O
Miss O
Sharp B-PERSON
had O
gone O
to O
pass O
the O


forenoon O
with O
her O
dear O
friend O
Miss O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
a O
lady O


very O
like O
her O
might O
have O
been O
seen O
entering O
a O
church O
in O
the O
City O
, O
in O
company O


with O
a O
gentleman O
with O
dyed O
mustachios O
, O
who O
, O
after O
a B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of I-DATE
an I-DATE
hour I-DATE
’s O


interval O
, O
escorted O
her O
back O
to O
the O
hackney O
- O
coach O
in O
waiting O
, O
and O
that O
this O


was O
a O
quiet O
bridal O
party O
. O


And O
who O
on O
earth O
, O
after O
the O
daily B-DATE
experience O
we O
have O
, O
can O
question O
the O


probability O
of O
a O
gentleman O
marrying O
anybody O
? O
How O
many O
of O
the O
wise O
and O


learned O
have O
married O
their O
cooks O
? O
Did O
not O
Lord O
Eldon B-PERSON
himself O
, O
the O
most O


prudent O
of O
men O
, O
make O
a O
run O
- O
away O
match O
? O
Were O
not O
Achilles B-PERSON
and O
Ajax B-ORG
both O
in O


love O
with O
their O
servant O
maids O
? O
And O
are O
we O
to O
expect O
a O
heavy O
dragoon O
with O


strong O
desires O
and O
small O
brains O
, O
who O
had O
never O
controlled O
a O
passion O
in O
his O


life O
, O
to O
become O
prudent O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
, O
and O
to O
refuse O
to O
pay O
any O
price O
for O


an O
indulgence O
to O
which O
he O

a O
mind O

If O
people O
only O
made O
prudent O
marriages O
, O


what O
a O
stop O
to O
population O
there O
would O
be O
! O


It O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
for O
my O
part O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
marriage O
was O
one O
of O
the O


honestest O
actions O
which O
we O
shall O
have O
to O
record O
in O
any O
portion O
of O
that O


gentleman O
’s O
biography O
which O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
present O
history O

No O
one O
will O


say O
it O
is O
unmanly O
to O
be O
captivated O
by O
a O
woman O

or O
, O
being O
captivated O

to O


marry O
her O
; O
and O
the O
admiration O
, O
the O
delight O
, O
the O
passion O
, O
the O
wonder O
, O
the O


unbounded O
confidence O
, O
and O
frantic O
adoration O
with O
which O
, O
by O
degrees O
, O
this O
big O


warrior O
got O
to O
regard O
the O
little O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
were O
feelings O
which O
the O
ladies O
at O


least O
will O
pronounce O
were O
not O
altogether O
discreditable O
to O
him O
. O
When O
she O


sang O
, O
every O
note O
thrilled O
in O
his O
dull O
soul O
, O
and O
tingled O
through O
his O
huge O


frame O
. O
When O
she O
spoke O
, O
he O
brought O
all O
the O
force O
of O
his O
brains O
to O
listen O
and O


wonder O
. O
If O
she O
was O
jocular O
, O
he O
used O
to O
revolve O
her O
jokes O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
and O


explode O
over O
them O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
afterwards O
in O
the O

to O
the O
surprise O
of O


the O

or O
the O
comrade O
riding O
with O
him O
in O


Rotten B-WORK_OF_ART

Her O
words O
were O
oracles O
to O
him O
, O
her O
smallest O
actions O
marked O
by O
an O


infallible O
grace O
and O
wisdom O
. O
 O
How O
she O
sings,—how O
she O
paints O

 O
thought O

 O
How O
she O
rode O
that O
kicking O

at O
Queen B-PERSON

 O
And O

the O

near O

the O
time O

Rawdon B-PERSON
expressed O
himself O
as O

he O
would O
be O
to O
charge O

There O
was O
no O

him O

put O
his O
letter O
into O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
volume O


of O
Porteus B-PERSON

Rebecca B-PERSON
easily O
found O

She O
had O

at O
night B-TIME

and O
communicated O
to O
Rawdon B-GPE
the O
result O


of O
her O
determinations O

He O
agreed O

of O
course O

to O
everything O
; O
was O
quite O
sure O


that O
it O
was O
all O
right O
; O
that O
what O
she O
proposed O
was O
best O

that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON


would O
infallibly O
relent O

or O
 O
come O

 O

he O
said O

after O
a O

Had O


Rebecca B-PERSON

been O
entirely O

he O
would O

 O
You O

 O
You O

I O

I O

execute O
his O
part O

the O

she O

formed O
for O

It O
consisted O
simply O

very O
prudently O

Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
only O

happy O


at O

he O

He O
pranced O
off O

all O
the O
impetuosity O

He O
agreed O

so O
readily O

that O
the O

And O


having O
relieved O

Miss O

after O

Sir O

indulged O


in O
the O

an O

In O

Miss O

That O

She O
twined O

of O

She O
spoke O
lightly O

laughingly O
of O
Sir O

proposal O
, O


ridiculed O
it O
as O
the O
foolish O
fancy O
of O
an O

Briggs B-PERSON

you O

instead O

But O


that O
good O

was O
denied O
to O
the O

doubtless O
in O

this O

 O
If O

 O

 O
I O

 O

she O
never O

The O

 O
Becky B-PERSON

with O
rather O
a O

and O
she O
was O
quite O
contented O
to O
wait O
until O
the O

be O
reconciled O
, O


before O
she O
claimed O
her O

she O
lived O
at O

no O

Major O

her O

circumspection O

and O
Crawley B-PERSON

reputation O
as O
a O

 O
We O

Mary B-PERSON

We O

It O

best O
that O
you O

at O

 O
As O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
trembled O
in O
every O
limb O

almost O


fell O

He O
thought O
the O

would O
have O
overpowered O
his O

his O

to O
whom O


he O
had O
never O

But O
it O
was O
he O
that O
was O
the O
most O
moved O

sudden O


as O
the O

was O
to O
her O

When O
he O
sank O
back O

it O
was O
the O

She O
took O
his O

it O

put O
it O
round O

: O
she O
called O
him O
her O
John B-PERSON
— O
her O
dear O
John B-PERSON
— O
her O
old O

— O
her O
kind O
old O

she O
poured O
out O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
words O
of O
incoherent O
love O
and O


tenderness O
; O
her O
faithful O
voice O

simple O

wrought O
this O

up O


to O
an O

up O

told O
the O

the O

ever O

anything O

the O

cares O

the O
would O

seemed O
every O

more O

her O

And O
she O


had O
misgivings O

fears O
which O
she O
dared O
not O
acknowledge O
to O
herself O
, O
though O


she O
was O
always O
secretly O
brooding O
over O
them O

Her O
heart O
tried O
to O
persist O
in O
asserting O
that O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
was O
worthy O

faithful O
to O
her O
, O
though O
she O
knew O
otherwise O

How O

she O
said O

and O
got O
no O

him O

How O
many O
suspicions O

indifference O
had O
she O
to O
encounter O

obstinately O
overcome O
. O
To O
whom O
could O


the O
poor O
little O
martyr O
tell O
these O
daily O
struggles O
and O
tortures O
? O
Her O
hero O


himself O
only B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
understood O
her O
. O
She O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
own O
that O
the O
man O
she O


loved O
was O
her O
inferior O

or O
to O
feel O
that O

given O
her O

away O
too O


soon O

Given O

, O
the O
pure O

too O

too O


trustful O

too O

We O

We O
let O

abroad O

with O

pink O

to O

them O

of O

But O
their O

 O
Down O
with O


such O

 O
says O
the O

in O

 O
You O
fool O

why O

? O
 O
says O
prosperity O
to O
the O
poor O

battling O

black O

Who O
has O
not O
remarked O
the O
readiness O
with O
which O
the O
closest O

suspect O

accuse O

Everybody O
is O
right O
, O
I O


suppose O

the O

Then O
Osborne B-PERSON
had O
the O
intolerable O
sense O
of O
former O
benefits O
to O
goad O

irritate O
him O
: O
these O
are O
always O
a O
cause O
of O

Finally O
, O
he O


had O
to O
break O
off O
the O
match O

Sedley B-PERSON

his O
son O

and O
as O
it O


had O
gone O
very O
far O
indeed O
, O
and O
as O
the O
poor O
girl O
’s O
happiness O
and O
perhaps O


character O
were O
compromised O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
show O
the O
strongest O
reasons O


for O
the O
rupture O
, O
and O
for O
John B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
to O
prove O
John B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
to O
be O
a O
very O
bad O


character O
indeed O
. O


At O
the O
meetings O
of O
creditors O
, O
then O
, O
he O
comported O
himself O
with O
a O
savageness O


and O
scorn O
towards O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
which O
almost O
succeeded O
in O
breaking O
the O
heart O
of O


that O
ruined O
bankrupt O
man O

On O
George B-PERSON
’s O
intercourse O
with O
Amelia B-PERSON
he O
put O
an O


instant O
veto O
— O
menacing O
the O
youth O
with O
maledictions O
if O
he O
broke O
his O
commands O
, O


and O
vilipending O
the O
poor O
innocent O
girl O
as O
the O
basest O
and O
most O
artful O
of O


vixens O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
great O
conditions O
of O
anger O

hatred O
is O

that O
you O
must O


tell O

against O
the O

the O
announcement O

her O

faith O
in O


the O

— O
a O
brutal O
letter O
from O
John B-PERSON

told O
her O
in O
a O

that O

when O
the O
final O
award O
came O
, O
it O
did O
not O


shock O
her O
so O
much O
as O
her O
parents O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
rather O
expected O
( O
for O
John B-PERSON


Sedley I-PERSON
himself O
was O
entirely O
prostrate O
in O
the O
ruins O
of O
his O
own O
affairs O
and O


shattered O
honour O
) O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON
took O
the O
news O
very O
palely O
and O
calmly O
. O
It O
was O
only O


the O
confirmation O
of O
the O
dark O
presages O
which O
had O
long O
gone O
before O
. O
It O
was O
the O


mere O
reading O
of O
the O
sentence O
— O
of O
the O
crime O
she O
had O
long O
ago O
been O
guilty O
— O
the O


crime O
of O
loving O
wrongly O
, O
too O
violently O
, O
against O
reason O
. O
She O
told O
no O
more O
of O


her O
thoughts O
now O
than O
she O
had O
before O
. O
She O
seemed O
scarcely O
more O
unhappy O
now O


when O
convinced O
all O
hope O
was O
over O
, O
than O
before O
when O
she O
felt O
but O
dared O
not O


confess O
that O
it O
was O
gone O
. O
So O
she O
changed O
from O
the O
large O
house O
to O
the O
small O


one O
without O
any O
mark O
or O
difference O
; O
remained O
in O
her O
little O
room O
for O
the O
most O


part O
; O
pined O
silently O
; O
and O
died O
away O
day O
by O
day O
. O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
say O
that O


all O
females O
are O
so O
. O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Bullock B-PERSON
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O

your O

heart O


would O
break O
in O
this O
way O
. O
You O
are O
a O
strong O
- O
minded O
young O
woman O
with O
proper O


principles O
. O
I O
do O
not O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
mine O
would O
; O
it O
has O
suffered O
, O
and O
, O


it O
must O
be O
confessed O
, O
survived O
. O
But O
there O
are O
some O
souls O
thus O
gently O


constituted O
, O
thus O
frail O
, O
and O
delicate O
, O
and O
tender O

Whenever O
old O
John B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
thought O
of O
the O
affair O
between O
George B-PERSON
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O


or O
alluded O
to O
it O
, O
it O
was O
with O
bitterness O
almost O
as O
great O
as O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON


himself O
had O
shown O
. O
He O
cursed O
Osborne B-PERSON
and O
his O
family O
as O
heartless O
, O
wicked O
, O


and O
ungrateful O
. O
No O
power O
on O
earth O
, O
he O
swore O
, O
would O
induce O
him O
to O
marry O
his O


daughter O
to O
the O
son O
of O
such O
a O
villain O
, O
and O
he O
ordered O
Emmy B-PERSON
to O
banish O
George B-PERSON


from O
her O
mind O
, O
and O
to O
return O
all O
the O
presents O
and O
letters O
which O
she O
had O
ever O


had O
from O
him O
. O


She O
promised O
acquiescence O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
obey O
. O
She O
put O
up O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
or O
three B-CARDINAL


trinkets O
: O
and O
, O
as O
for O
the O
letters O
, O
she O
drew O
them O
out O
of O
the O
place O
where O
she O


kept O
them O
; O
and O
read O
them O
over O
— O
as O
if O
she O
did O
not O
know O
them O
by O
heart O
already O
; O


but O
she O
could O
not O
part O
with O
them O
. O
That O
effort O
was O
too O
much O
for O
her O
; O
she O


placed O
them O
back O
in O
her O
bosom O
again O
— O
as O
you O
have O
seen O
a O
woman O
nurse O
a O
child O


that O
is O
dead O
. O
Young B-PERSON
Amelia I-PERSON
felt O
that O
she O
would O
die O
or O
lose O
her O
senses O


outright O
, O
if O
torn O
away O
from O
this O
last O
consolation O
. O
How O
she O
used O
to O
blush O
and O


lighten O
up O
when O
those O
letters O
came O
! O
How O
she O
used O
to O
trip O
away O
with O
a O
beating O


heart O
, O
so O
that O
she O
might O
read O
unseen O
! O
If O
they O
were O
cold O
, O
yet O
how O
perversely O


this O
fond O
little O
soul O
interpreted O
them O
into O
warmth O
. O
If O
they O
were O
short O
or O


selfish O
, O
what O
excuses O
she O
found O
for O
the O
writer O
! O


It O
was O
over O
these O
few O
worthless O
papers O
that O
she O
brooded O
and O
brooded O
. O
She O


lived O
in O
her O
past O
life O
— O
every O
letter O
seemed O
to O
recall O
some O
circumstance O
of O


it O
. O
How O
well O
she O
remembered O
them O
all O
! O
His O
looks O
and O
tones O
, O
his O
dress O
, O
what O


he O
said O
and O
how O
— O
these O
relics O
and O
remembrances O
of O
dead O
affection O
were O
all O


that O
were O
left O
her O
in O
the O
world O
. O
And O
the O
business O
of O
her O
life O
, O
was O
— O
to O
watch O


the O
corpse O
of O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART

To O
death O
she O
looked O
with O
inexpressible O
longing O
. O
Then O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
I O
shall O


always O
be O
able O
to O
follow O
him O
. O
I O
am O
not O
praising O
her O
conduct O
or O
setting O
her O


up O
as O
a O
model O
for O
Miss O
Bullock B-PERSON
to O
imitate O
. O
Miss O
B. B-PERSON
knows O
how O
to O
regulate O
her O


feelings O
better O
than O
this O
poor O
little O
creature O
. O
Miss O
B. B-PERSON
would O
never O
have O


committed O
herself O
as O
that O
imprudent O
Amelia B-PERSON
had O
done O
; O
pledged O
her O
love O


irretrievably O
; O
confessed O
her O
heart O
away O
, O
and O
got O
back O
nothing O
— O
only O
a O
brittle O


promise O
which O
was O
snapt O
and O
worthless O
in O
a O
moment O

A O
long O
engagement O
is O
a O


partnership O
which O
one B-CARDINAL
party O
is O
free O

which O

by O
good O
old O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O
catastrophe O
. O
He O


tried O
his O
new O
uniform O
, O
which O
became O
him O
very O
handsomely O
, O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
the O


first B-ORDINAL
meeting O
of O
the O
creditors O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
gentleman O
took O
place O
. O
His O


father O
told O
him O
of O
the O
wicked O
, O
rascally O
, O
shameful O
conduct O
of O
the O
bankrupt O
, O


reminded O
him O
of O
what O
he O
had O
said O
about O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
their O
connection O
was O


broken O
off O
for O
ever O
; O
and O
gave O
him O
that O
evening B-TIME
a O
good O
sum O
of O
money O
to O
pay O


for O
the O
new O
clothes O
and O
epaulets O
in O
which O
he O
looked O
so O
well O
. O
Money O
was O


always O
useful O
to O
this O
free O
- O
handed O
young O
fellow O
, O
and O
he O
took O
it O
without O
many O


words O
. O
The O
bills O
were O
up O
in O
the O
Sedley B-PERSON
house O
, O
where O
he O
had O
passed O
so O
many O
, O


many O
happy O
hours O
. O
He O
could O
see O
them O
as O
he O
walked O
from O
home O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
( O
to O


the O
Old O
Slaughters O
’ O
, O
where O
he O
put O
up O
when O
in O
town O
) O
shining O
white O
in O
the O


moon O
. O
That O
comfortable O
home O
was O
shut O
, O
then O
, O
upon O
Amelia B-PERSON
and O
her O
parents O
: O


where O
had O
they O
taken O
refuge O
? O
The O
thought O
of O
their O
ruin O
affected O
him O
not O
a O


little O
. O
He O
was O
very O
melancholy O
that O
night O
in O
the O
coffee O
- O
room O
at O
the O


Slaughters O
’ O
; O
and O
drank O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
as O
his O
comrades O
remarked O
there O
. O


Dobbin B-PERSON
came O
in O
presently O
, O
cautioned O
him O
about O
the O
drink O
, O
which O
he O
only O


took O
, O
be O
said O
, O
because O
he O
was O
deuced O
low O
; O
but O
when O
his O
friend O
began O
to O
put O


to O
him O
clumsy O
inquiries O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
for O
news O
in O
a O
significant O
manner O
, O


Osborne B-PERSON
declined O
entering O
into O
conversation O
with O
him O
; O
avowing O
, O
however O
, O
that O


he O
was O
devilish O
disturbed O
and O
unhappy O
. O


Three B-DATE
days I-DATE
afterwards O
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
found O
Osborne B-PERSON
in O
his O
room O
at O
the O


barracks:—his O
head O
on O
the O
table O
, O
a O
number O
of O
papers O
about O
, O
the O
young O
Captain O


evidently O
in O
a O
state O
of O
great O
despondency O
. O
 O
She O
— O
she O
’s O
sent O
me O
back O
some O


things O
I O
gave O
her O
— O
some O
damned O
trinkets O
. O
Look O
here O
! O
 O
There O
was O
a O
little O


packet O
directed O
in O
the O
well O
- O
known O
hand O
to O
Captain O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
, O
and O
some O


things O
lying O
about O
— O
a O
ring O
, O
a O
silver O
knife O
he O
had O
bought O
, O
as O
a O
boy O
, O
for O
her O


at O
a O
fair O
; O
a O
gold O
chain O
, O
and O
a O
locket O
with O
hair O
in O
it O
. O
 O
It O
’s O
all O
over O
. O
 O
said O


he O
, O
with O
a O
groan O
of O
sickening O
remorse O
. O
 O
Look O
, O
Will O
, O
you O
may O
read O
it O
if O
you O


like O
. O
 O


There O
was O
a O
little O
letter O
of O
a O
few O
lines O
, O
to O
which O
he O
pointed O
, O
which O
said O
: O
— O


 O
My O
papa O
has O
ordered O
me O
to O
return O
to O
you O
these O
presents O
, O


which O
you O
made O
in O
happier O
days B-DATE
to O
me O
; O
and O
I O
am O
to O
write O
to O
you O
for O


the O
last O
time O
. O
I O
think O
, O
I O
know O
you O
feel O
as O
much O
as O
I O
do O
the O
blow O


which O
has O
come O
upon O
us O
. O
It O
is O
I O
that O
absolve O
you O
from O
an O
engagement O


which O
is O
impossible O
in O
our O
present O
misery O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
had O
no O


share O
in O
it O
, O
or O
in O
the O
cruel O
suspicions O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
which O
are O


the O
hardest O
of O
all O
our O
griefs O
to O
bear O
. O
Farewell O

Farewell O

I O
pray O


God O
to O
strengthen O
me O
to O
bear O
this O

other O
calamities O

and O
to O
bless O


you O
always O

 O
I O
shall O
often O
play O
upon O
the O
piano O
— O
your O
piano O
. O


It O
was O
like O
you O
to O
send O
it O
. O
 O


Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
women O
and O
children O
in O
pain O


always O
used O
to O
melt O
him O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
broken O
- O
hearted O
and O
lonely O
, O
tore O


that O
good O
- O
natured O
soul O
with O
anguish O
. O
And O
he O
broke O
out O
into O
an O
emotion O
, O
which O


anybody O
who O
likes O
may O
consider O
unmanly O
. O
He O
swore O
that O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
an O
angel O
, O


to O
which O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
aye O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
. O
He O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
reviewing O


the O
history O
of O
their O
lives O
— O
and O
had O
seen O
her O
from O
her O
childhood O
to O
her O


present O
age O
, O
so O
sweet O
, O
so O
innocent O
, O
so O
charmingly O
simple O
, O
and O
artlessly O
fond O


and O
tender O
. O


What O
a O
pang O
it O
was O
to O
lose O
all O
that O
: O
to O
have O
had O
it O
and O
not O
prized O
it O
! O
A O


thousand O
homely O
scenes O
and O
recollections O
crowded O
on O
him O
— O
in O
which O
he O
always O


saw O
her O
good O
and O
beautiful O
. O
And O
for O
himself O
, O
he O
blushed O
with O
remorse O
and O


shame O
, O
as O
the O
remembrance O
of O
his O
own O
selfishness O
and O
in O
difference O


contrasted O
with O
that O
perfect O
purity O
. O
For O
a O
while O
glory O
, O
war O
, O
everything O
was O


forgotten O
, O
and O
the O
pair O
of O
friends O
talked O
about O
her O
only O
. O


 O
Where O
are O
they O
? O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
asked O
, O
after O
a O
long O
talk O
, O
and O
a O
long O
pause,—and O
, O


in O
truth O
, O
with O
no O
little O
shame O
at O
thinking O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
no O
steps O
to O


follow O
her O
. O
 O
Where O
are O
they O
? O
There O
’s O
no O
address O
to O
the O
note O
. O
 O


Dobbin B-PERSON
knew O
. O
He O
had O
not O
merely O
sent O
the O
piano O
; O
but O
had O
written O
a O
note O
to O


Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
and O
asked O
permission O
to O
come O
and O
see O
her,—and O
he O
had O
seen O
her O
, O


and O
Amelia B-PERSON
too O
. O
yesterday B-DATE
, O
before O
he O
came O
down O
to O
Chatham B-GPE
; O
and O
, O
what O
is O


more O
, O
he O
had O
brought O
that O
farewell O
letter O
and O
packet O
which O
had O
so O
moved O


them O
. O


The O
good O
- O
natured O
fellow O
had O
found O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
only O
too O
willing O
to O
receive O


him O
, O
and O
greatly O
agitated O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
piano O
, O
which O
, O
as O
she O


conjectured O
, O

must O

have O
come O
from O
George B-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
a O
signal O
of O
amity O


on O
his O
part O
. O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
did O
not O
correct O
this O
error O
of O
the O
worthy O
lady O
, O


but O
listened O
to O
all O
her O
story O
of O
complaints O
and O
misfortunes O
with O
great O


sympathy O
— O
condoled O
with O
her O
losses O
and O
privations O
, O
and O
agreed O
in O
reprehending O


the O
cruel O
conduct O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
towards O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
benefactor O
. O
When O
she O
had O


eased O
her O
overflowing O
bosom O
somewhat O
, O
and O
poured O
forth O
many O
of O
her O
sorrows O
, O


he O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
ask O
actually O
to O
see O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
above O
in O
her O
room O


as O
usual O
, O
and O
whom O
her O
mother O
led O
trembling O
downstairs O
. O


Her O
appearance O
was O
so O
ghastly O
, O
and O
her O
look O
of O
despair O
so O
pathetic O
, O
that O


honest O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON
was O
frightened O
as O
he O
beheld O
it O
; O
and O
read O
the O
most O


fatal O
forebodings O
in O
that O
pale O
fixed O
face O
. O
After O
sitting O
in O
his O
company O
a O


minute O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
she O
put O
the O
packet O
into O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
 O
Take O
this O
to O


Captain O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
and O
— O
and O
I O
hope O
he O
’s O
quite O
well O
— O
and O
it O
was O


very O
kind O
of O
you O
to O
come O
and O
see O
us O
— O
and O
we O
like O
our O
new O
house O
very O
much O
. O
And O


I O
— O
I O
think O
I O
’ll O
go O
upstairs O
, O
Mamma B-PERSON
, O
for O
I O
’m O
not O
very O
strong O
. O
 O
And O
with O
this O
, O


and O
a O
curtsey O
and O
a O
smile O
, O
the O
poor O
child O
went O
her O
way O
. O
The O
mother O
, O
as O
she O


led O
her O
up O
, O
cast O
back O
looks O
of O
anguish O
towards O
Dobbin B-PERSON
. O
The O
good O
fellow O


wanted O
no O
such O
appeal O
. O
He O
loved O
her O
himself O
too O
fondly O
for O
that O
. O


Inexpressible B-PERSON
grief O
, O
and O
pity O
, O
and O
terror O
pursued O
him O
, O
and O
he O
came O
away O
as O


if O
he O
was O
a O
criminal O
after O
seeing O
her O
. O


When O
Osborne B-PERSON
heard O
that O
his O
friend O
had O
found O
her O
, O
he O
made O
hot O
and O
anxious O


inquiries O
regarding O
the O
poor O
child O
. O
How O
was O
she O
? O
How O
did O
she O
look O
? O
What O
did O


she O
say O
? O
His O
comrade O
took O
his O

looked O
him O
in O
the O
face O

 O
George B-PERSON

The O

Miss O

at O

WE O
have O
seen O
how O
Mrs. O

the O
lady O

maid O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
any O
event O
of O


importance O

the O
Crawley B-PERSON

came O
to O
her O
knowledge O
, O
felt O
bound O
to O


communicate O
it O
to O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
Rectory O
; O
and O
have O
before O


mentioned O
how O
particularly O
kind O
and O
attentive O
that O
good O

natured O
lady O
was O
to O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
confidential O

She O
had O
been O
a O
gracious O
friend O
to O
Miss O


Briggs B-PERSON
, O
the O

also O
; O
and O
had O
secured O
the O

by O
a O


number O
of O
those O
attentions O
and O
promises O
, O
which O
cost O
so O
little O
in O
the O
making O
, O


and O
are O
yet O
so O
valuable O
and O
agreeable O
to O
the O
recipient O
. O
Indeed O
every O
good O


economist O
and O
manager O
of O
a O
household O
must O
know O
how O
cheap O
and O
yet O
how O
amiable O


these O
professions O
are O
, O
and O
what O
a O
flavour O
they O
give O
to O
the O
most O
homely O
dish O


in O
life O
. O
Who O
was O
the O
blundering O
idiot O
who O
said O
that O

Half B-CARDINAL
the O

As O
the O
immortal O
Alexis B-PERSON
Soyer I-PERSON
can O
make O
more O
delicious O


soup O
for O
a B-QUANTITY
halfpenny I-QUANTITY
than O
an O
ignorant O
cook O
can O
concoct O
with O
pounds O
of O


vegetables O

, O
so O
a O
skilful O

will O
make O
a O

of O
a O

bungler O
. O
Nay B-PERSON
, O
we O
know O
that O
substantial O
benefits O
often O
sicken O
some O


stomachs O
; O
whereas O
, O
most O
will O
digest O
any O
amount O
of O
fine O
words O

and O
be O
always O


eager O
for O
more O

Mrs. O

had O
told O
Briggs B-PERSON

so O


often O
of O
the O

what O

she O

would O


do O

if O
she O
had O

for O

attached O

that O
the O

in O
question O
had O
the O
deepest O
regard O
for O
her O
; O
and O


felt O
as O
much O
gratitude O

confidence O
as O
if O
Mrs. O

loaded O
them O
with O


the O
most O

Rawdon B-PERSON

if O

As O


his O

the O

followed O
the O

jokes O
about O
as O
delicate O
as O

Whereas O

Mrs. O

admired O
her O

showed O

if O

Firkin B-PERSON
a O


twopenny B-PERSON

halfpenny I-PERSON
present O
, O
accompanied O
it O
with O
so O
many O
compliments O

that O


the O
twopence O
- O
halfpenny O
was O
transmuted O
into O
gold O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
grateful O


waiting O

who O
, O
besides O
, O
was O
looking O

quite O
contentedly O
to O
some O


prodigious O

must O
happen O
to O
her O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
Mrs. O

came O


into O
her O
fortune O

The O
different O
conduct O
of O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
is O
pointed O
out O
respectfully O
to O


the O
attention O
of O
persons O
commencing O
the O

Praise O
everybody O
, O
I O
say O
to O


such O
: O
never O
be O
squeamish O

but O
speak O
out O
your O
compliment O
both O
point O
blank O
in O


a O
man O

and O
behind O
his O

, O
when O
you O

there O
is O
a O
reasonable O


chance O
of O
his O
hearing O
it O
again O

Never O
lose O
a O
chance O
of O
saying O
a O
kind O
word O

As O
Collingwood B-PERSON
never O
saw O
a O
vacant O
place O
in O
his O
estate O
but O
he O
took O
an O
acorn O


out O
of O
his O
pocket O
and O
popped O
it O
in O
; O
so O
deal O
with O
your O
compliments O
through O


life O
. O
An O
acorn O
costs O
nothing O
; O
but O
it O
may O
sprout O
into O
a O
prodigious O
bit O
of O


timber O
. O


In O
a O
word O
, O
during O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
’s O
prosperity O
, O
he O
was O
only O
obeyed O
with O


sulky O
acquiescence O
; O
when O
his O
disgrace O
came O
, O
there O
was O
nobody O
to O
help O

him O

Whereas O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
took O
the O
command O
at O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON

house O

the O

all O

of O
promotion O
from O
her O

and O
her O
kind O
words O

That O
he O
would O
consider O
himself O
beaten O

after O
one B-CARDINAL
defeat O
, O
and O
make O
no O


attempt O
to O
regain O
the O
position O
he O
had O
lost O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute O
Crawley B-PERSON
never O
allowed O


herself O
to O
suppose O
. O
She O
knew O
Rebecca B-PERSON
to O
be O
too O
clever O
and O
spirited O
, O
and O


desperate O
a O
woman O
to O
submit O
without O
a O

; O
and O
felt O
that O
she O
must O


prepare O
for O
that O

and O
be O
incessantly O
watchful O
against O
assault O

In O
the O

, O
though O
she O
held O
the O

was O
she O
sure O

Would O

had O
she O
not O
a O

longing O

The O
old O

liked O
Rawdon B-PERSON

and O


Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
who O
amused O
her O

Mrs. O

could O
not O
disguise O
from O

the O
fact O


that O
none O

 O
She O
always O
used O

Jim B-PERSON

stiff O
college O


manners O
and O
poor O
dear O
Bute B-ORG

about O
his O

always O
annoyed O


her O

If O
I O
took O
her O
to O
the O
Rectory O

she O
would O
grow O
angry O
with O
us O
all O

and O


fly O

I O

and O
might O
fall O

Rawdon B-PERSON

again O

be O
the O
victim O
of O
that O
little O

of O
a O

Meanwhile O
, O
it O
is O


clear O
to O
me O
that O
she O
is O
exceedingly O
unwell O
, O
and O
can O
not O
move O
for O
some B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O


at O
any O
rate O

during O
which O
we O
must O
think O
of O
some O
plan O
to O
protect O
her O
from O
the O


arts O
of O
those O
unprincipled O
people O

 O


In O
the O
very O
best O
of O
moments O
, O
if O
anybody O
told O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
that O
she O
was O
, O
or O


looked O
ill O
, O
the O
trembling O
old O
lady O
sent O
off O
for O
her O
doctor O
; O
and O
I O
daresay O


she O

was O

very O
unwell O
after O
the O
sudden O
family O
event O
, O
which O
might O


serve O
to O
shake O
stronger O
nerves O
than O
hers O
. O
At O
least O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O


her O
duty O
to O
inform O
the O
physician O
, O
and O
the O
apothecary O
, O
and O
the O


dame O
- O
de O

compagnie O
, O
and O
the O
domestics O
, O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O
in O
a O
most O


critical O
state O
, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
to O
act O
accordingly O
. O
She O
had O
the O
street O


laid O
knee O

deep O
with O
straw O
; O
and O
the O
knocker O
put O
by O
with O
Mr. O
Bowls B-PERSON

plate O

She O
insisted O
that O
the O
Doctor O
should O
call O
twice O
a O
day O
; O
and O
deluged O
her O


patient O
with O
draughts O
every B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O
When O
anybody O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
she O


uttered O
a O

shshshsh O

so O
sibilant O
and O
ominous O
, O
that O
it O
frightened O
the O


poor O
old O
lady O
in O
her O
bed O

from O
which O
she O
could O
not O
look O
without O
seeing O
Mrs. O


Bute B-ORG

beady O
eyes O
eagerly O
fixed O

as O
the O

sate O
steadfast O

They O
seemed O
to O
lighten O
in O
the O
dark O
( O
for O
she O
kept O


the O
curtains O
closed O

as O
she O
moved O
about O
the O

He O
might O

he O

cast O
off O
that O


odious O

every O

the O

Mrs. O

Mrs. O

all O

of O

fleeced O
of O
four B-QUANTITY

She O
described O
with O


the O
most O

the O

the O

— O
the O
mean O

with O

had O


ministered O
to O

the O
astounding O

by O
which O
he O
had O
imposed O
upon O
the O


most O
generous O
of O

the O
ingratitude O
by O
which O
he O
had O

She O
imparted O
these O

gradually O
to O
Miss O

gave O
her O


the O

duty O

a O
Christian B-NORP

the O

her O

very O

It O
was O
a O


lost O

; O
and O
the O
moral O
to O
be O
inferred O
from O


Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
’s O
tale O
was O
, O
that O
the O
knavery O
of O
the O

was O
irremediable O

and O


that O
no O
properly O

ever O
notice O

again O

These O
were O
the O
materials O
which O
prudent O
Mrs. O

gathered O
together O
in O
Park B-GPE


Lane B-FAC
, O
the O
provisions O

as O
it O
were O
with O
which O
she O
fortified O

which O
she O
knew O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON

his O
wife O
would O
lay O
to O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
. O


But O
if O
a O
fault O
may O
be O
found O
with O
her O
arrangements O
, O
it O
is O
this O
, O
that O
she O
was O


too O
eager O
: O
she O
managed O
rather O
too O
well O
; O
undoubtedly O
she O
made O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON


more O
ill O
than O
was O
necessary O
; O
and O
though O
the O
old O
invalid O
succumbed O
to O
her O


authority O
, O
it O
was O
so O
harassing O
and O
severe O
, O
that O
the O
victim O
would O
be O
inclined O


to O
escape O
at O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL
chance O
which O
fell O
in O
her O
way O

Managing O
women O

the O
ornaments O
of O
their O

who O
order O

know O
so O
much O
better O
than O
any O
person O
concerned O
what O
is O
good O
for O
their O


neighbours O
, O
do O

sometimes O

Mrs. O

carried O
her O
conviction O


of O
the O

illness O
so O
far O
that O
she O
almost O
managed O
her O

 O

Mr. O

 O


 O
I O

 O
Mrs. O

 O
Yes O

Madam O

if O

want O
Mrs. O

 O

 O
Dr. O

have O
both O
considered O


Miss O

case O
with O
every O
anxiety O

, O
as O
you O
may O
suppose O

We O
see O


her O
low O

; O
family O

have O
agitated O
her O
. O
 O


 O
Her O

come O

, O
 O
Mrs. O

cried O

 O
Have O
agitated O
her O
: O

you O
arrived O
like O

my O

I O
assure O
you O

to O
soothe O
her O
under O
the O

calamity O

But O
Dr. O
Squills B-PERSON

I O
were O
thinking O
that O
our O
amiable O

not O


in O
such O
a O
state O
as O
renders O
confinement O
to O
her O

necessary O
. O
She O
is O


depressed O
, O
but O
this O
confinement O
perhaps O
adds O
to O
her O
depression O

She O
should O


have O
change O

fresh O

gaiety O
; O
the O
most O

 O
Mr. O

 O
Persuade O

dear O
Madam O

drag O
her O

her O
low O

They O
will O
restore O

said O


( O
letting O
the O
cat O
of O

out O
of O

, O
 O
would O
cause O

such O

that O

Miss O

usual O
terrors O

increased O
greatly O
when O
such O


dismal O

were O
made O
to O

Mrs. O

saw O
that O

the O

The O

she O

at O

 O
We O

of O
London B-GPE

 O
she O
then O
thought O

 O
I O
hear O
they O


are O
the O
most O
picturesque O
in O
the O
world O

 O
and O
so O
she O
had O
a O
sudden O
interest O
for O


Hampstead B-GPE
, O
and O
Hornsey B-ORG
, O
and O
found O
that O
Dulwich B-GPE
had O
great O
charms O
for O
her O
, O
and O


getting O
her O
victim O
into O
her O
carriage O
, O
drove O
her O
to O
those O
rustic O
spots O
, O


beguiling O
the O
little O
journeys O
with O
conversations O
about O
Rawdon B-PERSON

his O

and O
telling O
every O
story O
to O
the O
old O
lady O
which O
could O
add O
to O
her O
indignation O


against O
this O
pair O
of O
reprobates O
. O


Perhaps O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
pulled O
the O
string O
unnecessarily O
tight O

For O
though O
she O


worked O
up O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
to O
a O
proper O
dislike O
of O
her O
disobedient O
nephew O

the O

a O
great O
hatred O

panted O


to O
escape O

After O
a O
brief O
space O
, O
she O
rebelled O
against O
Highgate B-ORG

Hornsey B-ORG
utterly O
. O
She O
would O
go O
into O
the O
Park O
. O
Mrs. O

knew O
they O
would O
meet O


the O
abominable O
Rawdon B-GPE

she O
was O

One B-DATE

Rawdon B-PERSON

It O
was O
a O
nervous O
moment O

Rebecca B-PERSON

heart O
beat O
quick O
as O
she O
recognized O
the O
carriage O

and O
as O
the O
two B-CARDINAL


vehicles O
crossed O
each O

in O
a O

she O
clasped O
her O

looked O


towards O
the O
spinster O
with O
a O
face O

agonized O
attachment O

devotion O

Rawdon B-PERSON


himself O
trembled O
, O

his O
face O

purple O

his O

Only O


old O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O
moved O
in O

cast O
her O
great O
eyes O


nervously O
towards O
her O
old O
friends O
Miss O

bonnet O
was O
resolutely O


turned O
towards O
the O
Serpentine B-ORG

Mrs. O

happened O
to O
be O
in O
ecstasies O

the O

was O
calling O
him O
a O
little O

 O
Rawdon B-PERSON

to O
his O

 O
Try O
once O

, O
Rawdon B-GPE
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
answered O
. O
 O
Could O
not O
you O
lock O
your O
wheels O


into O
theirs O
, O
dearest O
? O
 O


Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
not O
the O
heart O
for O
that O
manœuvre B-PERSON

When O
the O
carriages O
met O
again O
, O


he O
stood O
up O
in O
his O
stanhope O
; O
he O
raised O
his O
hand O
ready O
to O
doff O
his O
hat O
; O
he O


looked O
with O
all O
his O
eyes O

But O
this O
time O
Crawley B-PERSON

face O
was O
not O
turned O
away O
; O


she O
and O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
looked O
him O
full O
in O
the O
face O
, O
and O
cut O
their O
nephew O


pitilessly O
. O
He O
sank O
back O
in O
his O
seat O
with O
an O
oath O
and O
striking O
out O
of O
the O


ring O
, O
dashed O
away O
desperately O
home O
, O
wards O
. O


It O
was O
a O
gallant O
and O
decided O
triumph O
for O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
. O
But O
she O
felt O
the O
danger O


of O
many O
such O
meetings O
, O
as O
she O
saw O
the O
evident O
nervousness O
of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
; O


and O
she O
determined O
that O
it O
was O
most O
necessary O
for O
her O
dear O
friend O
’s O
health O
, O


that O
they O
should O
leave O

In O

Captain O

Captain O

manager O
of O
the O

George B-PERSON

But O


for O
him O
it O
never O
would O
have O
taken O
place O
: O
he O
could O
not O
but O
confess O
as O
much O
to O


himself O
, O
and O
smiled O
rather O
bitterly O
as O
he O
thought O
that O
he O
of O
all O
men O

world O
should O
be O
the O
person O
upon O

yet O
when O

Captain O


Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
accustomed O
to O
go O
through O
it O
without O
many O
words O
or O
much O


hesitation O
: O
and O
, O
having O
made O
up O

that O
if O
Miss O

balked O

I O
forbear O

enter O

minute B-TIME
particulars O
of O
the O
interview O
between O
George B-PERSON


and O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
when O
the O
former O
was O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
feet O
( O
or O

say O
the O

of O
his O
young O
mistress O
by O
the O
intervention O
of O
his O


friend O
honest O
William B-PERSON
. O
A O
much O
harder O
heart O
than O
George B-PERSON
’s O
would O
have O
melted O


at O
the O
sight O
of O
that O
sweet O
face O
so O
sadly O
ravaged O
by O
grief O
and O
despair O
, O
and O


at O
the O
simple O
tender O
accents O
in O
which O
she O
told O
her O
little O
broken O
- O
hearted O


story O
: O
but O
as O
she O
did O
not O
faint O
when O
her O
mother O
, O
trembling O
, O
brought O
Osborne B-PERSON


to O
her O
; O
and O
as O
she O
only O
gave O
relief O
to O
her O
overcharged O
grief O
, O
by O
laying O
her O


head O
on O
her O
lover O
’s O
shoulder O
and O
there O
weeping O
for O
a O
while O
the O
most O
tender O
, O


copious O
, O
and O
refreshing O
tears O
— O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
too O
greatly O
relieved O
, O
thought O


it O
was O
best O
to O
leave O
the O
young O
persons O
to O
themselves O
; O
and O
so O
quitted O
Emmy B-PERSON


crying O
over O
George B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
, O
and O
kissing O
it O
humbly O
as O
if O
he O
were O
her O
supreme O


chief O
and O
master O
, O
and O
as O
if O
she O
were O
quite O
a O
guilty O
and O
unworthy O
person O


needing O
every O
favour O
and O
grace O
from O
him O
. O


This O
prostration O
and O
sweet O
unrepining O
obedience O
exquisitely O
touched O
and O


flattered O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
. O
He O
saw O
a O
slave O
before O
him O
in O
that O
simple O
yielding O


faithful O
creature O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
within O
him O
thrilled O
secretly O
somehow O
at O
the O


knowledge O
of O
his O
power O
. O
He O
would O
be O
generous O
- O
minded O
, O
Sultan B-PERSON
as O
he O
was O
, O
and O


raise O
up O
this O
kneeling O
Esther B-PERSON
and O
make O
a O
queen O
of O
her O
: O
besides O
, O
her O
sadness O


and O
beauty O
touched O
him O
as O
much O
as O
her O
submission O
, O
and O
so O
he O
cheered O
her O
, O
and O


raised O
her O
up O
and O
forgave O
her O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O
All O
her O
hopes O
and O
feelings O
, O


which O
were O
dying O
and O
withering O

this O
her O
sun O
having O
been O
removed O
from O
her O
, O


bloomed O
again O
and O
at O
once O
, O
its O
light O
being O
restored O
. O
You O
would O
scarcely O
have O


recognized O
the O
beaming O
little O
face O
upon O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
pillow O
that O
night O
as O
the O


one O
that O
was O
laid O
there O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before O
, O
so O
wan B-PERSON
, O
so O
lifeless O
, O
so O
careless O


of O
all O
round O
about O
. O
The O
honest O
Irish B-NORP
maid O
- O
servant O
, O
delighted O
with O
the O


change O
, O
asked O
leave O
to O
kiss O
the O
face O
that O
had O
grown O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
so O
rosy O
. O


Amelia B-PERSON
put O
her O
arms O
round O
the O
girl O
’s O
neck O
and O
kissed O
her O
with O
all O
her O
heart O
, O


like O
a O
child O
. O
She O
was O
little O
more O
. O
She O
had O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
a O
sweet O
refreshing O


sleep O
, O
like O
one O
— O
and O
what O
a O
spring O
of O
inexpressible O
happiness O
as O
she O
woke O
in O


the O
morning O
sunshine O
! O


 O
He O
will O
be O
here O
again O
to O

day O
, O
 O
Amelia B-PERSON
thought O
. O
 O
He O
is O
the O
greatest O
and O


best O
of O
men O
. O
 O
And O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
George B-PERSON
thought O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O


generousest O
creatures O
alive O
: O
and O
that O
he O
was O
making O
a O
tremendous O
sacrifice O


in O
marrying O
this O
young O
creature O

old O
Mrs. O

the O
two B-CARDINAL

left O


them O
embracing O
each O
other O
with O
all O
their O
might O
, O
like O
a O
true O
woman O
, O
was O
of O


opinion O
that O
no O

would O
induce O
Mr. O

to O
consent O
to O
the O


match O
between O
his O
daughter O
and O
the O
son O
of O
a O
man O
who O
had O
so O
shamefully O
, O


wickedly O
, O
and O
monstrously O
treated O
him O
. O
And O
she O
told O
a O
long O
story O
about O


happier O
days B-DATE
and O
their O
earlier O
splendours O
, O
when O
Osborne B-PERSON
lived O
in O
a O
very O


humble O
way O
in O
the B-FAC
New I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
and O
his O

too O
glad O

to O
receive O


some O
of O
Jos B-PERSON

little O
baby O
things O
, O
with O
which O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
accommodated O
her O
at O


the O
birth O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Osborne B-PERSON

children O
. O
The O
fiendish O
ingratitude O
of O
that O


man O
, O
she O
was O
sure O

had O
broken O
Mr. O

would O

 O

the O

of O
Captain O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON

and O
Miss O

 O
Was O

Well O
she O
never O

Mrs. O

was O

about O
this O
news O

She O
wished O
that O

it O
: O
Blenkinsop O


always O
mistrusted O
that O
Miss O

Dobbin B-PERSON
feared O

so O

that O

He O

forbidden O

Dobbin B-PERSON

He O
knew O
what O
a O

man O


Osborne B-PERSON
was O

how O
he O
stuck O
by O
his O

 O
The O
only O
chance O
George B-PERSON

of O


reconcilement B-PERSON

 O
argued O
his O

 O
is O
by O

If O

 O


Dobbin B-PERSON

with O
a O

 O
My O

here O
he O
paused O

for O
the B-DATE

it O

the O

 O
The O

 O

 O
I O

Bill B-PERSON

could O
any O

ever O
have O
speculated O

I O
say O

I O
curse O

rather O

Your O

as O
much O
your O

 O


 O

it O

not O
his O

that O
breaks O
the O

 O
old O
Sedley B-PERSON
cried O


out O

 O
It O

I O
that O
forbid O
it O

That O

separated O

I O
’m O
fallen O
low O

but O
not O
so O
low O
as O
that O
: O
no O
, O
no O

And O
so O
you O
may O
tell O
the O


whole O
race O
— O
son O
, O
and O
father O
, O
and O

, O
and O
all O

 O


 O
It O
’s O
my O
belief O
, O
sir O

that O
you O
have O
not O
the O
power O
or O
the O
right O
to O
separate O


those O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
answered O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
; O
 O
and O
that O
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
give O
your O


daughter O
your O
consent O
it O
will O
be O
her O
duty O
to O
marry O
without O
it O
. O
There O
’s O
no O


reason O
she O
should O
die O
or O
live O
miserably O
because O
you O
are O
wrong O
- O
headed O
. O
To O
my O


thinking O
, O
she O
’s O
just O
as O
much O
married O
as O
if O
the O
banns O
had O
been O
read O
in O
all O


the O
churches O
in O
London B-GPE

And O
what O
better O
answer O
can O
there O
be O
to O
Osborne B-PERSON

charges O
against O
you O
, O
as O
charges O
there O
are O
, O
than O
that O
his O
son O
claims O
to O
enter O


your O
family O
and O
marry O
your O
daughter O
? O
 O


A O
light O
of O
something O
like O
satisfaction O
seemed O
to O
break O
over O
old O
Sedley B-PERSON
as O


this O
point O
was O
put O
to O
him O
: O
but O
he O
still O
persisted O
that O
with O
his O
consent O
the O


marriage O
between O
Amelia B-PERSON
and O
George B-PERSON
should O
never O
take O
place O
. O


 O
We O
must O
do O
it O
without O
, O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
said O
, O
smiling O
, O
and O
told O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
as O
he O


had O
told O
Mrs. O

the B-DATE

, O
before O
the O
story O
of O
Rebecca B-PERSON

with O
Captain O

evidently O
amused O
the O
old O

 O
You O
’re O


terrible O
fellows O
, O
you O
Captains O
, O
 O
said O
he O
, O
tying O
up O
his O
papers O
; O
and O
his O
face O


wore O
something O
like O
a O
smile O
upon O
it O

to O
the O
astonishment O
of O
the O
blear O

waiter O
who O
now O
entered O

had O
never O
seen O
such O
an O
expression O
upon O
Sedley B-PERSON

since O
he O

the O

The O
idea O
of O
hitting O

Osborne B-PERSON
such O
a O
blow O
soothed O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O

their O

valuable O

the O
misfortune O

had O

George B-PERSON

good O
feelings O

his O
good O

Dobbin B-PERSON

never O

When O
the O
elder O
Osborne B-PERSON
gave O
what O
he O
called O
 O
a O
hint O

 O
there O
was O
no O


possibility O
for O
the O
most O
obtuse O

mistake O
his O
meaning O

He O
called O
kicking O
a O


footman O
down O

stairs O
, O
a O
hint O
to O
the O
latter O
to O
leave O
his O
service O

With O
his O


usual O
frankness O
and O
delicacy O
he O
told O
Mr. O
Haggistoun B-PERSON
that O
he O
would O
give O
her O
a O


cheque O
for O
five B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
his O
son O
was O
married O
to O
her O
ward O
; O


and O
called O
that O
proposal O
a O
hint O
, O
and O
considered O
it O
a O
very O
dexterous O
piece O
of O


diplomacy O
. O
He O
gave O
George B-PERSON
finally O
such O
another O
hint O
regarding O
the O
heiress O
; O


and O
ordered O
him O
to O
marry O
her O
out O
of O
hand O
, O
as O
he O
would O
have O
ordered O
his O


butler O
to O
drew O
a O
cork O
, O
or O
his O
clerk O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
. O


This O
imperative O
hint O
disturbed O
George B-PERSON
a O
good O
deal O
. O
He O
was O
in O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL


enthusiasm O
and O
delight O
of O
his O
second B-ORDINAL
courtship O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
which O
was O


inexpressibly O
sweet O
to O
him O
. O
The O
contrast O
of O
her O
manners O
and O
appearance O
with O


those O
of O
the O
heiress O
, O
made O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
union O
with O
the O
latter O
appear O
doubly O


ludicrous O
and O
odious O
. O
Carriages O

that O
! O
Add O

that O
the O
junior O
Osborne B-PERSON

quite O

obstinate O

the O
senior O
; O
when O
he O
wanted O


a O
thing O
, O
quite O
as O
firm O
in O
his O
resolution O
to O
get O
it O
; O
and O
quite O
as O
violent O


when O
angered O
, O
as O
his O
father O
in O
his O
most O
stern O
moments O

On O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
his O

formally O

him O
the O
hint O
that O
he O
was O

place O
his O

at O
Miss O
Swartz B-PERSON

feet O

George B-PERSON
temporised I-PERSON

the O
old O


gentleman O
. O
 O
You O
should O
have O
thought O
of O
the O
matter O
sooner O
, O
sir O

 O
he O
said O

 O
It O


ca O

service O

Wait O
until O
my O
return O

if O
I O
do O
return O

 O
and O
then O
he O
represented O
, O
that O
the O


time O
when O
the O
regiment O
was O
daily B-DATE
expecting O
to O
quite O
England B-GPE
, O
was O
exceedingly O


ill O

which O
they O
were O

be O

not O
to O

makin O
time O


enough O
for O
that O
when O
he O
came O
home O
with O
his O
majority O
; O
 O
for O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
, O
 O


said O
he O
, O
with O
a O
satisfied O
air O
, O
 O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
or O
other O
you O
shall O
read O
the O


name O
of O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
in O
the O

Gazette O
. O
 O


The O
father O
’s O
reply O
to O
this O
was O
founded O
upon O
the O
information O
which O
he O
had O


got O
in O
the O
City O
: O
that O
the O
West O
End O
chaps O
would O
infallibly O
catch O
hold O
of O
the O


heiress O
if O
any O
delay O
took O
place O
; O
that O
if O
he O
did O
n’t O
marry O
Miss O
S. B-PERSON
, O
he O
might O


at O
least O
have O
an O
engagement O
in O
writing O
, O
to O
come O
into O
effect O
when O
he O
returned O


to O
England B-GPE
; O
and O
that O
a O
man O
who O
could O
get O
ten B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
by O
staying O
at O


home O
, O
was O
a O
fool O
to O
risk O
his O
life O
abroad O
. O


 O
So O
that O
you O
would O
have O
me O
shown O
up O
as O
a O
coward O
, O
sir O
, O
and O
our O
name O


dishonoured O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
Miss O
Swartz B-PERSON

money O
, O
 O
George B-PERSON
interposed O
. O


This O
remark O
staggered O
the O
old O
gentleman O
; O
but O
as O
he O
had O
to O
reply O
to O
it O
, O
and O


as O
his O
mind O
was O
nevertheless O
made O
up O
, O
he O
said O
, O
 O
You O
will O
dine O
here O


to O
- O

, O
sir O
, O
and O
every O
day O
Miss O
Swartz B-PERSON
comes O
, O
you O
will O
be O
here O
to O
pay O


your O
respects O
to O
her O
. O
If O
you O
want O
for O
money O
, O
call O
upon O
Mr. O
Chopper B-PERSON
. O
 O
Thus O
a O


new O
obstacle O
was O
in O
George B-PERSON
’s O
way O
, O
to O
interfere O
with O
his O
plans O
regarding O


Amelia B-PERSON
; O
and O
about O
which O
he O
and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
confidential O


consultation O

His O
friend O

opinion O
respecting O
the O
line O
of O
conduct O
which O
he O


ought O
to O
pursue O
, O
we O
know O
already O
. O
And O
as O
for O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
when O
he O
was O
once O
bent O


on O
a O
thing O
, O
a O
fresh O
obstacle O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
only O
rendered O
him O
the O
more O
resolute O
. O


The O
dark O
object O
of O
the O
conspiracy O
into O
which O
the O
chiefs O
of O
the O
Osborne B-PERSON


family O
had O
entered O
, O
was O
quite O
ignorant O
of O
all O

regarding O

( O
which O
, O
strange O
to O

, O
her O
friend O

did O
not O
divulge O

, O
and O
, O


taking O
all O

of O
a O
very O
warm O

nature O
, O


responded O
to O
their O
affection O
with O
quite O
a O
tropical O
ardour O
. O
And O
if O
the O
truth O


may O
be O
told O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
that O
she O
too O
had O
some O
selfish O

in O
the O

not O

all O
the O
generations O

rallying O
instantly O
, O
he O


replied O

the O

look O
of O
his O

with O
another O
so O
indicative O
of O


resolution O

defiance O

that O
the O

during O
all O
the O
dinner O
, O
George B-PERSON
rattled O
on O


with O
a O
volubility O
which O
surprised O
himself O

made O
his O

doubly O


nervous O
for O
the O
fight O
which O
was O
to O
take O
place O
as O
soon O
as O
the O

gone O

The O
difference O
between O

was O

that O
while O
the O
father O
was O
violent O

a O
bully O
, O
the O
son O
had O
thrice O
the O
nerve O

of O

could O


not O
merely O
make O
an O
attack O

resist O
it O
; O

finding O
that O
the O
moment O
was O


now O
come O
when O
the O
contest O
between O
him O

his O

was O
to O
be O
decided O
, O
he O


took O
his O
dinner O
with O

before O
the O

Old O
Osborne B-PERSON

on O
the O

drank O
much O

He O


floundered O
in O
his O
conversation O
with O
the O
ladies O
, O
his O
neighbours O
: O
George B-PERSON
’s O


coolness O
only O
rendering O
him O
more O
angry O
. O
It O
made O
him O
half B-CARDINAL
mad O
to O
see O
the O
calm O


way O
in O
which O
George B-PERSON
, O
flapping O
his O
napkin O
, O
and O
with O
a O
swaggering O
bow O
, O
opened O


the O
door O
for O
the O

to O
leave O
the O
room O
; O
and O
filling O
himself O
a O
glass O
of O


wine O
, O
smacked O
it O
, O
and O
looked O
his O

full O
in O
the O

as O

 O
The O

his O
decanter O
clinked O
against O
the O

he O
tried O
to O
fill O


it O

After O
giving O
a O
great O
heave O

with O
a O
purple O
choking O

he O

began O

that O

the O

most O
sarcastic O

But O
it O
was O

considered O
the O
part O

 O
You O

not O

 O


 O
It O

Nobody O

Our O

done O
her O
quite O

I O

may O
leave O
off O

her O

down O

I O
’ll O

 O


 O
Go O

the O

his O

starting O
out O

 O
Go O
on O
about O
what O
, O
sir O
? O
about O
the O
way O
in O
which O
we O
’ve O
treated O
that O
angel O
of O


a O
girl O
? O
Who O
told O
me O
to O
love O
her O
? O
It O
was O
your O
doing O
. O
I O
might O
have O
chosen O


elsewhere O
, O
and O
looked O
higher O
, O
perhaps O
, O
than O
your O
society O
: O
but O
I O
obeyed O
you O
. O


And O
now O
that O
her O
heart O

mine O
you O
give O
me O
orders O
to O
fling O
it O
away O
, O
and O


punish O
her O
, O
kill O
her O
perhaps O
— O
for O
the O
faults O
of O
other O

It O
’s O
a O

by O

George B-PERSON

up O

one O

that O
it O

ca O

so O
the O

Osborne B-PERSON
felt O
himself O
pretty O
easy O
about O
his O
adversary O
in O
the O


encounter O
we O
have O
just O
described O
; O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
George B-PERSON
’s O
supplies O
fell O


short O
, O
confidently O
expected O
his O
unconditional O
submission O
. O
It O
was O
unlucky O
, O
to O


be O
sure O
, O
that O
the O
lad O
should O
have O
secured O
a O
stock O
of O
provisions O
on O
the B-DATE
very I-DATE

when O
the O

took O

this O
relief O
was O
only O
temporary O

old O
Osborne B-PERSON
thought O

would O

delay O
George B-PERSON

surrender O

No O


communication O
passed O
between O

some B-DATE

The O

was O


sulky O
at O
this O
silence O

not O
disquieted O
; O
for O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
he O
knew O
where O
he O


could O
put O
the O
screw O
upon O
George B-PERSON
, O
and O
only O
waited O
the O
result O
of O
that O


operation O
. O
He O
told O
the O
sisters O
the O
upshot O
of O
the O
dispute O
between O
them O
, O
but O


ordered O
them O
to O
take O
no O
notice O
of O
the O
matter O
, O
and O
welcome O
George B-PERSON
on O
his O


return O
as O
if O
nothing O

His O
cover O
was O
laid O
as O

and O
perhaps O
the O
old O
gentleman O
rather O
anxiously O
expected O
him O
; O
but O
he O
never O


came O

Some O
one O
inquired O
at O
the O
Slaughters O

him O

that O

at O
the O

pattering O
down O

the O

Some O

One O
asked O
him O

Dobbin B-PERSON

Demmy O

 O


Jos B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
was O
splendid O
. O
He O
was O
fatter O
than O
ever O
. O
His O
shirt O
collars O
were O


higher O
; O
his O
face O
was O
redder O
; O
his O
shirt O
- O
frill O
flaunted O
gorgeously O
out O
of O
his O


variegated O
waistcoat O
. O
Varnished O
boots O
were O
not O
invented O
as O
yet O
; O
but O
the O


Hessians B-NORP
on O
his O
beautiful O
legs O
shone O
so O
that O
they O
must O
have O
been O
the O


identical O
pair O
in O
which O
the O
gentleman O
in O
the O
old O
picture O
used O
to O
shave O


himself O
; O
and O
on O
his O
light O
green O
coat O
there O
bloomed O
a O
fine O
wedding O
favour O
, O


like O
a O
great O
white O
spreading O
magnolia O
. O


In O
a O
word O
, O
George B-PERSON
had O
thrown O
the O
great O
cast O
. O
He O
was O
going O
to O
be O
married O
. O


Hence O
his O
pallor O
and O
nervousness O
— O
his O
sleepless O
night O
and O
agitation O
in O
the O


morning O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
people O
who O
have O
gone O
through O
the O
same O
thing O
own O
to O
the O


same O
emotion O
. O
After O
three B-CARDINAL
of O
four B-CARDINAL
ceremonies O
, O
you O
get O
accustomed O
to O
it O
, O
no O


doubt O
; O
but O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
dip O
, O
everybody O
allows O
, O
is O
awful O
. O


The O
bride O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
brown O

( O

Captain O

Which O
she O
sported O
on O

As O

Mrs. O

George B-PERSON
. O


There O
was O
nobody O

the O


small O

their O

The O

The O
rain O
came O
rattling O
down O
on O
the O
windows O
. O
In O
the O
intervals O


of O
the O

you O

it O
, O
and O
the O
sobbing O
of O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
in O
the O
pew O
. O


The O
person O

tones O
echoed O
sadly O
through O
the O
empty O
walls O
. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
 O
I O
will O
 O


was O
sounded O
in O
very O
deep O
bass O
. O
Emmy B-PERSON
’s O
response O
came O
fluttering O
up O
to O
her O


lips O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
but O
was O
scarcely O
heard O
by O
anybody O
except O
Captain O


Dobbin B-PERSON

When O

Jos B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON

— O
George B-PERSON

 O
It O

your O

William B-PERSON

 O


says O
he O

putting O
his O

and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
went O
up O


and O

Then O

and O
signed O

 O
God O

Old O


Dobbin B-PERSON

 O
George B-PERSON
said O
, O
grasping O
him O
by O
the O
hand O
, O
with O
something O
very O
like O


moisture O
glistening O
in O
his O
eyes O
. O
William B-PERSON
replied O
only O
by O
nodding O
his O
head O
. O


His O
heart O
was O
too O
full O
to O
say O
much O

 O
Write O

After O

had O
taken O

crowd O
of O
damp O
urchins O
that O
were O
hanging O

the O


chapel O

The O

drove O
into O
the O

as O
they O


passed O
to O
the O

The O

The O

William B-PERSON

The O

Dobbin B-PERSON

the O
honest O

Jos B-PERSON

He O
put O

and O
left O

This O

 O

 O
Do O

when O
I O
was O

I O
thought O
you O
seemed O

It O


was O
that O
made O
me O
angry O

Do O

 O
Rebecca B-PERSON

that O
Osborne B-PERSON

not O

my O

I O

in O

what O


ensued O
? O
My O

Crocky B-PERSON
Doyle I-PERSON

deemed O
to O

rather O


impetuous O

but O
the O
honestest O

Becky B-PERSON

humility O
passed O
for O
sincerity O


with O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON

These O
two B-CARDINAL

had O
plenty O

Miss O

on O

all O
Rawdon B-PERSON

 O


Rawdon B-PERSON

Rebecca B-PERSON

He O
vowed O

that O
there O

no O

Almost O
immediately O
after O
their O

her O

her O

found O
the O
immense O
value O
of O
such O
a O

They O
had O
credit O
in O
plenty O

but O
they O
had O
bills O

in O

laboured O
under O
a O
scarcity O
of O

Did O
these O
debt O

difficulties O
affect O


Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
good O
spirits O
? O
No O
. O
Everybody O

must O
have O
remarked O
how O


well O
those O
live O

are O
comfortably O

thoroughly O
in O

how O
they O
deny O


themselves O

Rawdon B-GPE
abused O

with O
an O

which O
no O

surpass O

Long O

a O

faultless O

a O

The O

So O
this O
Machiavellian O

Misses B-PERSON

By O
a O

would O
be O
likely O
to O
meet O
Osborne B-PERSON

, O
though O


he O
had O
that O
abhorrence O
of O
routs O
and O
evening B-TIME
parties O
, O
which O
many O
sensible O


men O
, O
alas O

entertain O

soon O
found O
one O
where O
the O

Making O
his O

at O
the O

danced O
a O

with O
both O

and O
was O
prodigiously O
polite O

actually O
had O
the O
courage O


to O
ask O

a B-TIME

to O

What O
was O
it O
that O
made O

gaze O
upon O
him O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O


then O
on O

at O

make O
as O
if O

faint O
on O

This O

 O

how O

Surely O

 O

added O

 O
You O

too O

O O
Captain O

I O

rather O
too O
openly O

this O

parenthetic O

 O
The O

the O

arrived O

and O
that O
Dobbin B-PERSON

nervousness O
which O
now O
came O
on O

was O
visible O
in O
many O
twitchings O
of O
his O


face O

in O
his O

beating O

I O
say O

thought O
that O
when O
he O
had O
given O
himself O
a O
little O
air O
, O
he O
would O
unbosom O


himself O
entirely O

the O

 O
But O
it O

not O
about O

 O
About O
George O
? O
 O
she O
said O
in O
a O
tone O
so O
discomfited O
that O
Maria B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Wirt B-PERSON


laughed O
at O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
door O
, O
and O
even O
that O
abandoned O
wretch O
of O
a O


Dobbin B-PERSON
felt O
inclined O
to O
smile O
himself O
; O
for O
he O
was O
not O
altogether O
unconscious O


of O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
: O
George B-PERSON
having O
often O
bantered O
him O
gracefully O

about O

 O
There O
has O
been O
a O
difference O


between O
him O

Mr. O

And O
I O
regard O
him O
so O
much O

for O

 O


 O
Such O
an O

 O
Mr. O

with O


atrocious O
astuteness O

no O

 O


 O
I O

one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
affairs O
of O
the O

without O
any O

of O

 O
And O
there O
are O
others O

, O
 O
as O
true O
and O
as O
kind O

hearted O
as O


yourself O

I O
’m O
not O
speaking O
about O
the O
West B-NORP
Indian I-NORP
heiress O
, O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
but O


about O
a O
poor O
girl O
whom O
George B-PERSON
once O
loved O
, O
and O
who O
was O
bred O
from O
her O


childhood O
to O
think O
of O
nobody O

him O

I O
’ve O
seen O
her O
in O
her O
poverty O


uncomplaining O

broken O

without O
a O
fault O

It O
is O
of O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON

speak O
. O
Dear O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
can O
your O
generous O
heart O
quarrel O
with O
your O
brother O


for O
being O
faithful O
to O
her O
? O
Could O
his O
own O
conscience O
ever O
forgive O
him O
if O
he O


deserted O
her O
? O
Be O
her O
friend O
— O
she O
always O
loved O
you O
— O
and O
— O
and O
I O
am O
come O
here O


charged O
by O
George B-PERSON
to O
tell O
you O
that O
he O
holds O
his O
engagement O
to O
her O
as O
the O


most O
sacred O
duty O
he O
has O
; O
and O
to O
entreat O

you O
, O

at O
least O
, O
to O
be O
on O
his O


side O
. O
 O


When O
any O
strong O
emotion O
took O
possession O
of O
Mr. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
and O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL


word O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
hesitation O
, O
he O
could O
speak O
with O
perfect O
fluency O
, O
and O
it O
was O


evident O
that O
his O
eloquence O
on O
this O
occasion O
made O
some O
impression O
upon O
the O


lady O
whom O
he O
addressed O
. O


 O
Well O
, O
 O
said O
she O
, O
 O
this O
is O
— O
most O
surprising O
— O
most O
painful O
— O
most O


extraordinary O
— O
what O
will O
papa O
say?—that O
George B-PERSON
should O
fling O
away O
such O
a O


superb O
establishment O
as O
was O
offered O
to O
him,—but O
at O
any O
rate O
he O
has O
found O
a O


very O
brave O
champion O
in O
you O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
. O
It O
is O
of O
no O
use O
, O
however O
, O
 O
she O


continued O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
; O
 O
I O
feel O
for O
poor O
Miss O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
most O
certainly O
— O
most O


sincerely O
, O
you O
know O
. O
We O
never O
thought O
the O
match O
a O
good O
one O
, O
though O
we O
were O


always O
very O
kind O
to O
her O
here O
— O
very O
. O
But O
papa O
will O
never O
consent O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
. O


And O
a O
well O
brought O
up O
young O
woman O
, O
you O
know,—with B-ORG
a O
well O
- O
regulated O
mind O
, O


must O
— O
George B-PERSON
must O
give O
her O
up O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
indeed O
he O
must O
. O
 O


 O
Ought O
a O
man O
to O
give O
up O
the O
woman O
he O
loved O
, O
just O
when O
misfortune O
befel B-PERSON


her O
? O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
said O
, O
holding O
out O
his O
hand O
. O
 O
Dear O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
is O
this O
the O


counsel O
I O
hear O
from O

you O

? O
My O
dear O
young O
lady O
! O
you O
must O
befriend O
her O
. O


He O
ca O
n’t O
give O
her O
up O
. O
He O
must O
not O
give O
her O
up O
. O
Would O
a O
man O
, O
think O
you O
, O
give O


you O

up O
if O
you O
were O
poor O
? O
 O


This O
adroit O
question O
touched O
the O
heart O
of O
Miss O
Jane B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
not O
a O
little O
. O


 O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
whether O
we O
poor O
girls O
ought O
to O
believe O
what O
you O
men O
say O
, O


Captain O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
 O
There O
is O
that O
in O
woman O
’s O
tenderness O
which O
induces O
her O


to O
believe O
too O
easily O
. O
I O
’m O
afraid O
you O
are O
cruel O
, O
cruel O
deceivers,—and O


Dobbin B-PERSON
certainly O
thought O
he O
felt O
a O
pressure O
of O
the O
hand O
which O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON


had O
extended O
to O
him O
. O


He O
dropped O
it O
in O
some O
alarm O
. O
 O
Deceivers O
! O
 O
said O
he O
. O
 O
No O
, O
dear O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O


all O
men O
are O
not O
; O
your O
brother O
is O
not O
; O
George B-PERSON
has O
loved O
Amelia B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
ever O


since O
they O
were O
children O
; O
no O
wealth O
would O
make O
him O
marry O
any O
but O
her O
. O
Ought O


he O
to O
forsake O
her O
? O
Would O
you O
counsel O
him O
to O
do O
so O
? O
 O


What O
could O
Miss O
Jane B-PERSON
say O
to O
such O
a O
question O
, O
and O
with O
her O
own O
peculiar O


views O
? O
She O
could O
not O
answer O
it O
, O
so O
she O
parried O
it O
by O
saying O
, O
 O
Well O
, O
if O
you O


are O
not O
a O
deceiver O
, O
at O
least O
you O
are O

very O

romantic O
; O
 O
and O
Captain O


William B-PERSON
let O
this O
observation O
pass O
without O
challenge O
. O


At O
length O
when O
, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
farther O
polite O
speeches O
, O
he O
deemed O
that O
Miss O


Osborne B-PERSON
was O
sufficiently O
prepared O
to O
receive O
the O
whole O
news O
, O
he O
poured O
it O


into O
her O
ear O
. O
 O
George B-PERSON
could O
not O
give O
up O
Amelia B-PERSON
— O
George B-PERSON
was O
married O
to O


her—and O
then O
he O
related O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
marriage O
as O
we O
know O

counted O

their O


father O

as O
women O

so O

assuredly O

so O
, O


asking O
permission O
( O
readily O
granted O

to O
see O
her O
again O
, O
and O
rightly O


conjecturing O
that O
the O

would O
be O
told O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
five I-DATE


minutes I-DATE
to O
the O
other O
ladies O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
made O
his O
bow O
and O
took O
his O


leave O
. O


He O
was O
scarcely O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
when O
Miss O
Maria B-PERSON
and O
Miss O
Wirt B-PERSON
rushed O
in O


to O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
whole O
wonderful O
secret O
was O
imparted O
to O
them O
by O
that O


lady O
. O
To O
do O
them O
justice O
, O
neither O
of O
the O
sisters O
was O
very O
much O
displeased O
. O


There O
is O
something O
about O
a O
runaway O
match O
with O
which O
few O
ladies O
can O
be O


seriously O
angry O
, O
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
rather O
rose O
in O
their O
estimation O
, O
from O
the O
spirit O


which O
she O
had O
displayed O
in O
consenting O
to O
the O
union O
. O
As O
they O
debated O
the O


story O
, O
and O
prattled O
about O
it O
, O
and O
wondered O
what O
papa O
would O
do O
and O
say O
, O
came O


a O
loud O
knock O
as O
of O
an O
avenging O
thunder O
- O
clap O
, O
at O
the O
door O
, O
which O
made O
these O


conspirators O
start O
. O
It O
must O
be O
papa O
, O
they O
thought O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
he O
. O
It O
was O


only O
Mr. O
Frederick B-PERSON
Bullock I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
come O
from O
the O
City O
according O
to O


appointment O
, O
to O
conduct O
the O
ladies O
to O
a O
flower O

show O

This O
gentleman O
, O
as O
may O
be O
imagined O
, O
was O
not O
kept O
long O
in O
ignorance O
of O
the O


secret O
. O
But O
his O
face O
, O
when O
he O
heard O
it O
, O
showed O
an O
amazement O
which O
was O
very O


different O
to O
that O
look O
of O
sentimental O
wonder O
which O
the O
countenances O
of O
the O


sisters O
wore O
. O
Mr. O
Bullock B-PERSON
was O
a O
man O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
a O
junior O
partner O
of O
a O


wealthy O
firm O
. O
He O
knew O
what O
money O
was O
, O
and O
the O
value O
of O
it O
: O
and O
a O
delightful O


throb O
of O
expectation O
lighted O
up O
his O
little O
eyes O
, O
and O
caused O
him O
to O
smile O
on O


his O
Maria B-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
thought O
that O
by O
this O
piece O
of O
folly O
of O
Mr. O
George B-PERSON
’s O
she O


might O
be O
worth O
thirty B-QUANTITY

more O
than O
he O
had O
ever O
hoped O
to O
get O


with O
her O

the O

 O

will O
be O

cried O
off O

You O
may O

yet O
. O
 O


The O

had O
never O
thought O
of O
the O
money O
question O
up O
to O
that O
moment O
, O
but O


Fred B-PERSON
Bullock I-PERSON
bantered O
them O
with O
graceful O
gaiety O
about O
it O
during O
their O


forenoon O
’s O
excursion O
; O
and O
they O
had O
risen O
not O
a O
little O
in O
their O
own O
esteem O
by O


the O
time O
when O
, O
the O
morning B-TIME
amusement O
over O

they O
drove O
back O
to O
dinner O

And O
do O


not O
let O
my O
respected O
reader O
exclaim O
against O
this O
selfishness O
as O
unnatural O
. O


It O
was O
but O
this B-TIME
present I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
as O
he O
rode O
on O
the O
omnibus O
from O
Richmond B-GPE
; O


while O
it O
changed O
horses O
, O
this O
present O
chronicler O

being O
on O

marked O


three B-CARDINAL

very O
dirty O

friendly O

To O
these O

came O
another O

 O

your O

At O


which O
the O

got O
up O
from O

instantly O
, O
and O
ran O
off O
to O
pay O


their O
court O
to O
Peggy B-PERSON

And O
as O
the O
omnibus O
drove O
off O
, O
I O
saw O
Peggy B-PERSON
with O
the O


infantine O
procession O
at O

marching O
with O
great O

towards O
the O

Mr. O

Takes O
down O
the B-PRODUCT

SO I-PRODUCT
having O
prepared O
the O

, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
hastened O
away O
to O
the O
City O
to O
perform O


the O
rest O
and O
more O
difficult O
part O
of O
the O
task O
which O
he O
had O
undertaken O
. O
The O


idea O
of O
facing O
old O
Osborne B-PERSON
rendered O
him O
not O
a O
little O
nervous O
, O
and O
more O
than O


once O
he O
thought O
of O
leaving O
the O
young O
ladies O
to O
communicate O
the O
secret O
, O


which O
, O
as O
he O
was O
aware O
, O
they O
could O
not O
long O
retain O
. O
But O
he O
had O
promised O
to O


report O
to O
George B-PERSON
upon O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
elder O
Osborne B-PERSON
bore O
the O


intelligence O
; O
so O
going O
into O
the O
City O
to O
the O
paternal O
countinghouse O
in O
Thames B-GPE


Street O
, O
he O
despatched O
thence O
a O
note O
to O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
begging O
for O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
’s O


conversation O
relative O
to O
the O
affairs O
of O
his O
son O
George B-PERSON

Dobbin B-PERSON

messenger O


returned O
from O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
house O
of O
business O
, O
with O
the O
compliments O
of O
the O


latter O
, O
who O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
to O
see O
the O
Captain O
immediately O
, O
and O
away O


accordingly O
Dobbin B-PERSON
went O
to O
confront O
him O
. O


The O
Captain O
, O
with O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
guilty O
secret O
to O
confess O
, O
and O
with O
the O
prospect O
of O


a O
painful O
and O
stormy O
interview O
before O
him O
, O
entered O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
offices O


with O
a O
most O
dismal O
countenance O
and O
abashed O
gait O
, O
and O
, O
passing O
through O
the O


outer O
room O
where O
Mr. O
Chopper B-PERSON
presided O
, O
was O
greeted O
by O
that O
functionary O
from O


his O
desk O
with O
a O
waggish O
air O
which O
farther O
discomfited O
him O
. O
Mr. O
Chopper B-PERSON


winked O
and O
nodded O
and O
pointed O
his O
pen O
towards O
his O
patron O
’s O
door O
, O
and O
said O
, O


 O
You O
’ll O
find O
the O
governor O
all O
right O
, O
 O
with O
the O
most O
provoking O
good O


humour O
. O


Osborne B-PERSON
rose O
too O
, O
and O
shook O
him O
heartily O
by O
the O
hand O
, O
and O
said O
, O
 O
How O
do O
, O
my O


dear O
boy O
? O
 O
with O
a O
cordiality O
that O
made O
poor O
George B-PERSON
’s O
ambassador O
feel O
doubly O


guilty O
. O
His O
hand O
lay O
as O
if O
dead O
in O
the O
old O
gentelman B-PERSON
’s O
grasp O
. O
He O
felt O
that O


he O
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
was O
more O
or O
less O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
that O
had O
happened O
. O
It O
was O
he O


had O
brought O
back O
George B-PERSON
to I-PERSON
Amelia I-PERSON
: O
it O
was O
he O
had O
applauded O
, O
encouraged O
, O


transacted O
almost O
the O
marriage O
which O
he O
was O
come O
to O
reveal O
to O
George B-PERSON
’s O


father O
: O
and O
the O
latter O
was O
receiving O
him O
with O
smiles O
of O
welcome O
; O
patting O
him O


on O
the O
shoulder O
, O
and O
calling O
him O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
my O
dear O
boy O
. O
 O
The O
envoy O
had O
indeed O


good O
reason O
to O
hang O
his O
head O
. O


Osborne B-PERSON
fully O
believed O
that O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
come O
to O
announce O
his O
son O
’s O


surrender O
. O
Mr. O
Chopper B-PERSON
and O
his O
principal O
were O
talking O
over O
the O
matter O


between O
George B-PERSON
and O
his O
father O
, O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
messenger O


arrived O
. O
Both O
agreed O
that O
George B-PERSON
was O
sending O
in O
his O
submission O
. O
Both O
had O


been O
expecting O
it O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
— O
and O
 O
Lord O
! O
Chopper B-PERSON
, O
what O
a O
marriage O
we O
’ll O


have O
! O
 O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
to O
his O
clerk O
, O
snapping O
his O
big O
fingers O
, O
and O
jingling O


all O
the O
guineas O
and O
shillings O
in O
his O
great O
pockets O
as O
he O
eyed O
his O


subordinate O
with O
a O
look O
of O
triumph O
. O


With O
similar O
operations O
conducted O
in O
both O
pockets O
, O
and O
a O
knowing O
jolly O
air O
, O


Osborne B-PERSON
from O
his O
chair O
regarded O
Dobbin B-PERSON
seated O
blank O
and O
silent O
opposite O
to O


him O
. O
 O
What O
a O
bumpkin O
he O
is O
for O
a O
Captain O
in O
the O
army O
, O
 O
old O
Osborne B-PERSON
thought O
. O


 O
I O
wonder O
George B-PERSON
has O
n’t O
taught O
him O
better O
manners O
. O
 O


At O
last O
Dobbin B-PERSON
summoned O
courage O
to O
begin O
. O
 O
Sir O
, O
 O
said O
he O
, O
 O
I O
’ve O
brought O
you O


some O
very O
grave O
news O
. O
I O
have O
been O
at O
the B-FAC
Horse I-FAC
Guards I-FAC
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O


there O
’s O
no O
doubt O
that O
our O
regiment O
will O
be O
ordered O
abroad O
, O
and O
on O
its O
way O
to O


Belgium B-GPE
before O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
is O
over O
. O
And O
you O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
that O
we O
sha O
n’t O
be O
home O


again O
before O
a O
tussle O
which O
may O
be O
fatal O
to O
many O
of O
us O
. O
 O


Osborne B-PERSON
looked O
grave O
. O
 O
My O
s O
— O
— O
, O
the O
regiment O
will O
do O
its O
duty O
, O
sir O
, O
I O


daresay O
, O
 O
he O
said O
. O


 O
The O
French B-NORP
are O
very O
strong O
, O
sir O
, O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
went O
on O
. O
 O
The O
Russians B-NORP
and O


Austrians B-NORP
will O
be O
a O
long O
time O
before O
they O
can O
bring O
their O
troops O
down O
. O
We O


shall O
have O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
the O
flight O
, O
sir O
; O
and O
depend O
on O
it O
Boney B-PERSON
will O
take O


care O
that O
it O
shall O
be O
a O
hard O
one O
. O
 O


 O
What O
are O
you O
driving O
at O
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
? O
 O
his O
interlocutor O
said O
, O
uneasy O
and O
with O
a O


scowl O
. O
 O
I O
suppose O
no O
Briton B-PERSON
’s O
afraid O
of O
any O
d O
— O
— O
Frenchman B-NORP
, O
hay O
? O
 O


 O
I O
only O
mean O
, O
that O
before O
we O
go O
. O
and O
considering O
the O
great O
and O
certain O
risk O


that O
hangs O
over O
every O
one O
of O
us O
— O
if O
there O
are O
any O
differences O
between O
you O
and O


George B-PERSON
— O
it O
would O
be O
as O
well O
, O
sir O
, O
that O
— O
that O
you O
should O
shake O
hands O
: O
would O
n’t O


it O
? O
Should O
anything O
happen O
to O
him O
, O
I O
think O
you O
would O
never O
forgive O
yourself O


if O
you O
had O
n’t O
parted O
in O
charity O
. O
 O


As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
poor O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON
blushed O
crimson O
, O
and O
felt O
and O
owned O


that O
he O
himself O
was O
a O
traitor O
. O
But O
for O
him O
, O
perhaps O
, O
this O
severance O
need O


never O
have O
taken O
place O
. O
Why O
had O
not O
George B-PERSON
’s O
marriage O
been O
delayed O
? O
What O


call O
was O
there O
to O
press O
it O
on O
so O
eagerly O
? O
He O
felt O
that O
George B-PERSON
would O
have O


parted O
from O
Amelia B-PERSON
at O
any O
rate O
without O
a O
mortal O
pang O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
too O
, O


might O

have O
recovered O
the O
shock O
of O
losing O
him O
. O
It O
was O
his O


counsel O
had O
brought O
about O
this O
marriage O
, O
and O
all O
that O
was O
to O
ensue O
from O
it O
. O


And O
why O
was O
it O
? O
Because O
he O
loved O
her O
so O
much O
that O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
see O


her O
unhappy O
; O
or O
because O
his O
own O
sufferings O
of O
suspense O
were O
so O
unendurable O


that O
he O
was O
glad O
to O
crush O
them O
at O
once O
— O
as O
we O
hasten O
a O
funeral O
after O
a O
death O
, O


or O
, O
when O
a O
separation O
from O
those O
we O
love O
is O
imminent O
, O
can O
not O
rest O
until O
the O


parting O
be O
over O
. O


 O
You O
are O
a O
good O
fellow O
, O
William B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
in O
a O
softened O
voice O
; O


 O
and O
me O
and O
George B-PERSON
should O
n’t O
part O
in O
anger O
, O
that O
is O
true O
. O
Look O
here O
. O
I O
’ve O


done O
for O
him O
as O
much O
as O
any O
father O
ever O
did O
. O
He O
’s O
had O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
much O


money O
from O
me O
, O
as O
I O
warrant O
your O
father O
ever O
gave O
you O
. O
But O
I O
do O
n’t O
brag O


about O
that O
. O
How O
I O
’ve O
toiled O
for O
him O
, O
and O
worked O
and O
employed O
my O
talents O
and O


energy O
, O

I O

wo O
n’t O
say O
. O
Ask O
Chopper O
. O
Ask O
himself O
. O
Ask O
the O
City O
of O


London B-GPE
. O
Well O
, O
I O
proposed O
to O
him O
such O
a O
marriage O
as O
any O
nobleman O
in O
the O
land O


might O
be O
proud O
of O
— O
the O
only O
thing O
in O
life O
I O
ever O
asked O
him O
— O
and O
he O
refuses O
me O
. O


Am O

I O

wrong O
? O
Is O
the O
quarrel O

my O

making O
? O
What O
do O
I O
seek O
but O


his O
good O
, O
for O
which O
I O
’ve O
been O
toiling O
like O
a O
convict O
ever O
since O
he O
was O
born O
? O


Nobody O
can O
say O
there O
’s O
anything O
selfish O
in O

me O
. O

Let O
him O
come O
back O
. O
I O


say O
, O
here O
’s O
my O
hand O
. O
I O
say O
, O
forget O
and O
forgive O
. O
As O
for O
marrying O
now O
, O
it O
’s O


out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
Let O
him O
and O
Miss B-PERSON
S. I-PERSON
make O
it O
up O
, O
and O
make O
out O
the O


marriage O
afterwards O
, O
when O
he O

When O

Mr. O

and O
Osborne B-PERSON
had O


companies O
, O
was O
an O
old O
General O
who O
had O
made O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
campaign O
under O
Wolfe B-PERSON
at O


Quebec B-GPE
, O
and O
was O
long O
since O
quite O
too O
old O
and O
feeble O
for O
command O
; O
but O
he O
took O


some O
interest O
in O
the O
regiment O
of O
which O
he O
was O
the O
nominal O
head O
, O
and O
made O


certain O
of O
his O
young O
officers O
welcome O
at O
his O
table O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
hospitality O


which O
I O
believe O
is O
not O
now O
common O
amongst O
his O
brethren O
. O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
was O


an O
especial O
favourite O
of O
this O
old O
General O
. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
versed O
in O
the O


literature O
of O
his O
profession O
, O
and O
could O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
Frederick B-PERSON
, O
and O


the O
Empress B-ORG
Queen O
, O
and O
their O
wars O
, O
almost O
as O
well O
as O
the O
General O
himself O
, O


who O
was O
indifferent O
to O
the O
triumphs O
of O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
and O
whose O
heart O
was O


with O
the O
tacticians O
of O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
back I-DATE
. O
This O
officer O
sent O
a O
summons O
to O


Dobbin B-PERSON
to O

breakfast O
with O
him O
, O
on O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME

Mr. O

altered O
his O

and O
Mr. O
Chopper B-PERSON
put O
on O
his O
best O

and O
then O


informed O
his O
young O
favourite O
, O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
in O
advance O
, O
of O
that O
which O

The O

a B-DATE

or O
two B-CARDINAL

as O

they O
would O
get O
their O

before O


the B-DATE
week I-DATE
was O
over O

Recruits O
had O
come O
in O
during O
the O
stay O
of O
the O
regiment O
at O


Chatham B-GPE
; O
and O
the O
old O
General O
hoped O
that O
the O

which O
had O
helped O
to O


beat O
Montcalm B-GPE
in O
Canada B-GPE
, O
and O
to O
rout O
Mr. O
Washington B-PERSON
on O
Long B-GPE
Island I-GPE
, O
would O


prove O
itself O
worthy O
of O
its O

reputation O
on O
the O
oft O

of O

 O
And O
so O
, O
my O
good O

the O
old O
General O

taking O
a O
pinch O
of O

with O


his O
trembling O
white O
old O
hand O
, O
and O
then O
pointing O
to O
the O

of O
his O

robe O


de O

under O
which O
his O
heart O
was O
still O

 O


With O
which O
the O
General O
gave O
his O
young O

a O
finger O
to O

and O
a O


good O

This O
news O
made O
Dobbin B-PERSON
grave I-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
thought O
of O
our O
friends O
at O
Brighton B-GPE
, O
and O


then O
he O
was O
ashamed O
of O
himself O
that O
Amelia B-PERSON

; O
and O
returning O


to O

he O
sent O
off O
a O

to O
Mr. O

him O
with O


the O
information O

he O
had O

to O

This O

as O
he O
opened O

he O
trembled O
lest O
the O

put O
off O

he O
was O
calculating O

His O
mind O
was O
inexpressibly O


relieved O

found O
that O
the O

only O

Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
quite O
justified O
in O
repeating O

any O

Shouting O

Mr. O

, O
as O
may O

he O
tried O
on O
a O
new O
bearskin O


cap O

under O

he O
looked O
savage O
beyond O

Then O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
lads O
went O


off O
to O
the O
Slaughters O

and O
having O
ordered O
a O
famous O
dinner O

sat O
down O

letters O
full O
of O

Ah O

for O

Dobbin B-PERSON

relented O

locked O
up O

 O
Why O

 O
said O

 O
Let O

backed O


up O
that O

told O
him O
if O
he O
would O
leave O
off O
brandy O

water O


he O
would O
be O
a O
good O
soldier O

Young B-PERSON

Dobbin B-PERSON

greatly O


respected O

 O
Thank O

Dobbin B-PERSON

 O
I O
was O


just O

The O
two B-CARDINAL

the O
Captain O

and O
Mr. O

dined O
together O
in O
the O

Chopper B-PERSON
brought O
the O
letter O
from O
Mr. O

in O
which O
the O
letter O


briefly O
presented O
his O

requested O
him O
to O


forward O
the O

Captain O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON

Chopper B-PERSON
knew O
nothing O


further O

he O
described O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
appearance O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
and O
his O


interview O
with O
his O
lawyer O
, O
wondered O
how O
the O
governor O
had O
sworn O
at O
nobody O
, O


and O
— O
especially O
as O
the O
wine O
circled O
round O

abounded O
in O
speculations O

conjectures O

But O
these O
grew O
more O
vague O
with O
every O
glass O

at O
length O


became O
perfectly O
unintelligible O

At O
a B-TIME
late I-TIME

Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
put O
his O
guest O


into O
a O
hackney O

swearing O
that O

be O


the O

the O
kick O

Captain O

friend O
for O

When O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
took O

we O

said O
that O
he O
asked O

the O

expected O
him O

some B-TIME

when O
, O
perhaps O

had O

had O
he O
asked O
her O


that O
question O
which O
she O
was O
prepared O

answer O

she O
would O
have O
declared O


herself O
as O
her O
brother O

and O
a O
reconciliation O
might O
have O
been O


effected O
between O
George B-PERSON

his O
angry O
father O

But O
though O

at O

the O

He O
had O
his O

his O

at O

In O

any O

Mr. O

at O
the B-FAC

Dobbin B-PERSON
assumed O
a O
jovial O
and O


rattling O
manner O
, O
which O
proved O
that O
this O
young O
officer O
was O
becoming O
a O
more O


consummate O
hypocrite O
every O
day O
of O
his O
life O
. O
He O
was O
trying O
to O
hide O
his O
own O


private O
feelings O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
upon O
seeing O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
in O
her O

secondly B-ORDINAL
to O

entertained O

to O
the O


effect O
which O
the O
dismal O
news O
brought O
down O
by O
him O
would O
certainly O
have O
upon O


her O
. O


 O
It O
is O
my O
opinion O
, O
George B-PERSON
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
 O
that O
the O
French B-NORP
Emperor O
will O
be O
upon O


us O
, O
horse O
and O
foot O
, O
before O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

will O
give O
the O

such O


a O
dance O
as O
shall O
make O
the O
Peninsula B-LOC
appear O
mere O
child O

But O
you O
need O


not O
say O
that O
to O
Mrs. O

you O
know O

There O
may O

any O

our O

turn O

military O

Many O

think O
so O
; O
and O
Brussels B-GPE
is O
full O
of O
fine O


people O

ladies O
of O

 O
So O
it O
was O
agreed O
to O
represent O
the O
duty O
of O
the O


British B-NORP

in O

very O
amusing O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON

who O


was O
watching O
the O

indeed O
she O
watched O
every O

Little O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
it O
must O
be O
owned O

had O
rather O
a O
mean O
opinion O
of O
her O
husband O

friend O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON

He O
lisped B-PERSON
— O
he O
was O
very O
plain O
and O
homely O
- O
lookin O
and O


exceedingly O
awkward O
and O
ungainly O
. O
She O
liked O
him O
for O
his O
attachment O
to O
her O


husband O
( O
to O
be O
sure O
there O
was O
very O
little O
merit O
in O
that O

, O
and O
she O
thought O


George B-PERSON
was O
most O
generous O
and O
kind O
in O
extending O
his O
friendship O
to O
his O
brother O


officer O

George B-PERSON
had O
mimicked O
Dobbin B-PERSON

lisp O
and O
queer O
manners O
many O
times O
to O
her O
, O


though O
to O
do O
him O
justice O
, O
he O
always O
spoke O
most O
highly O
of O
his O
friend O

good O


qualities O

In O
her O
little O
day O
of O
triumph O
, O
and O
not O
knowing O
him O
intimately O
as O


yet O
, O
she O
made O
light O
of O
honest O
William B-PERSON

and O
he O
knew O
her O
opinions O
of O
him O
quite O


well O
, O
and O
acquiesced O
in O
them O
very O
humbly O
. O
A O
time O
came O
when O
she O
knew O
him O


better O
, O
and O
changed O
her O
notions O
regarding O
him O
; O
but O
that O
was O
distant O
as O


yet O

As O
for O
Rebecca B-PERSON

Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
not O
been O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
in O

before O
she O
understood O
his O
secret O
perfectly O

She O
did O
not O
like O
him O

and O
feared O
him O
privately O
; O
nor O
was O
he O
very O
much O
prepossessed O
in O
her O
favour O

He O
was O
so O
honest O
, O
that O
her O
arts O

cajoleries B-ORG
did O
not O
affect O
him O
, O
and O
he O


shrank O
from O
her O
with O
instinctive O
repulsion O

And O
, O
as O
she O
was O
by O
no O
means O
so O


far O
superior O
to O
her O
sex O
as O
to O
be O
above O
jealousy O
, O
she O
disliked O
him O
the O

for O
his O
adoration O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON

Nevertheless O
, O
she O
was O
very O
respectful O

told O

archly O

and O
she O
made O
a O

poor O

And O
her O
neglect O


of O
her O
parents O
( O

indeed O
there O
was O
some O
foundation O

this O

the O
poor O

uneasy O
conscience O
brought O
against O
her O

was O
now O
remembered O


for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
and O
caused O
her O
to O
blush O
with O
humiliation O
. O
Oh O
! O
thought O


she O
, O
I O
have O
been O
very O
wicked O
and O
selfish O
— O
selfish O
in O
forgetting O
them O
in O
their O


sorrows O
— O
selfish O
in O
forcing O
George B-PERSON
to O
marry O
me O
. O
I O
know O
I O
’m O
not O
worthy O
of O


him O
— O
I O
know O
he O
would O
have O
been O
happy O
without O
me O
— O
and O
yet O
— O
I O
tried O
, O
I O
tried O
to O


give O
him O
up O
. O


It O
is O
hard O
when O
before O
seven B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
marriage O
are O
over O
, O
such O
thoughts O
and O


confessions O
as O
these O
force O
themselves O
on O
a O
little O
bride O
’s O
mind O
. O
But O
so O
it O


was O
, O
and O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before O
Dobbin B-PERSON
came O
to O
join O
these O
young O
people O
— O
on O
a O
fine O


brilliant O
moonlight B-TIME
night I-TIME
of O
May O
— O
so O
warm O
and O
balmy O
that O
the O
windows O
were O


flung O
open O
to O
the O
balcony O
, O
from O
which O
George B-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
were O
gazing O


upon O
the O
calm O
ocean O
spread O
shining O
before O
them O
, O
while O
Rawdon B-GPE
and O
Jos B-PERSON
were O


engaged O
at O
backgammon O
within O
— O
Amelia B-PERSON
couched O
in O
a O
great O
chair O
quite O


neglected O
, O
and O
watching O
both O
these O
parties O
, O
felt O
a O
despair O
and O
remorse O
such O


as O
were O
bitter O
companions O
for O
that O
tender O
lonely O
soul O
. O
Scarce O
a O
week O
was O


past O
, O
and O
it O
was O
come O
to O
this O
! O
The O
future O
, O
had O
she O
regarded O
it O
, O
offered O
a O


dismal O
prospect O
; O
but O
Emmy B-PERSON
was O
too O
shy O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
to O
look O
to O
that O
, O
and O


embark O
alone O
on O
that O
wide O
sea O
, O
and O
unfit O
to O
navigate O
it O
without O
a O
guide O
and O


protector O
. O
I O
know O
Miss O
Smith B-PERSON
has O
a O
mean O
opinion O
of O
her O
. O
But O
how O
many O
, O
my O


dear O
Madam O
, O
are O
endowed O
with O
your O
prodigious O
strength O
of O
mind O
? O


 O
Gad B-PERSON
, O
what O
a B-TIME
fine I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
and O
how O
bright O
the O
moon O
is O
! O
 O
George B-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O


puff O
of O
his O
cigar O
, O
which O
went O
soaring O
up O
skywards O
. O


 O
How O
delicious O
they O
smell O
in O
the O
open O
air O
! O
I O
adore O
them O
. O
Who O
’d O
think O
the O


moon O
was O
two B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL

 O
Becky B-PERSON
added O
, O
gazing O
at O
that O

with O
a O
smile O
. O
 O
Is O
n’t O
it O
clever O


of O
me O
to O
remember O
that O
? O
Pooh B-PERSON
! O
we O
learned O
it O
all O
at O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
! O
How O


calm O
the O
sea O
is O
, O
and O
how O
clear O
everything O
. O
I O
declare O
I O
can O
almost O
see O
the O


coast O
of O
France B-GPE
! O
 O
and O
her O
bright O
green O
eyes O
streamed O
out O
, O
and O
shot O
into O
the O


night O
as O
if O
they O

could O

see O
through O
it O
. O


 O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
I O
intend O
to O
do O
one B-TIME
morning I-TIME
? O
 O
she O
said O
; O
 O
I O
find O
I O
can O
swim O


beautifully O
, O
and O
some B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
when O
my O
Aunt O
Crawley B-PERSON

companion O
— O
old O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
you O


know O
— O
you O
remember O
her O
— O
that O
hook O

nosed O
woman O
, O
with O
the O
long O
wisps O
of O


hair O
— O
when O
Briggs B-PERSON
goes O
out O
to O
bathe O
, O
I O
intend O
to O
dive O
under O
her O
awning O
, O
and O


insist O
on O
a O
reconciliation O
in O
the O
water O
. O
Is O
n’t O
that O
a O
stratagem O
? O
 O


George B-PERSON
burst O
out O
laughing O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
this O
aquatic O
meeting O
. O
 O
What O
’s O
the O


row O
there O
, O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
? O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
shouted O
out O
, O
rattling O
the O
box O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
making O


a O
fool O
of O
herself O
in O
an O
absurd O
hysterical O
manner O
, O
and O
retired O
to O
her O
own O


room O
to O
whimper O
in O
private O
. O


Our O
history O
is O
destined O
in O
this O
chapter O
to O
go O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
in O
a O


very O
irresolute O
manner O
seemingly O
, O
and O
having O
conducted O
our O
story O
to O


to O
- O
morrow B-DATE
presently O
, O
we O
shall O
immediately O
again O
have O
occasion O
to O
step O
back O


to O
yesterday B-DATE
, O
so O
that O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
tale O
may O
get O
a O
hearing O
. O
As O
you O
behold O


at O
her O
Majesty O

the O

high O

, O
while O
Captain O

are O


waiting O

: O
as O
you O
see O
in O
the O
Secretary O
of O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
’s O


antechamber O
, O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
of O
petitioners O
waiting O
patiently O
for O
their O


audience O
, O
and O
called O
out O
one B-CARDINAL
by O
one O
, O
when O
suddenly O
an O
Irish B-NORP
member O
or O
some O


eminent O
personage O
enters O
the O
apartment O
, O
and O
instantly O
walks O
in O
to O
Mr. O


Under O
- O
Secretary O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
all O
the O
people O
present O
: O
so O
in O
the O
conduct O


of O
a O
tale O
, O
the O
romancer O
is O
obliged O
to O
exercise O
this O
most O
partial O
sort O
of O


justice O
. O
Although O
all O
the O
little O
incidents O
must O
be O
heard O
, O
yet O
they O
must O
be O


put O
off O
when O
the O
great O
events O
make O
their O
appearance O
; O
and O
surely O
such O
a O


circumstance O
as O
that O
which O
brought O
Dobbin B-GPE
to O
Brighton B-GPE
, O
viz B-GPE
. I-GPE
, O
the O
ordering O


out O
of O
the O

that O
country O
under O
the O
command O
of O
his O
Grace B-ORG
the I-ORG
Duke I-ORG
of O


Wellington B-GPE
— O
such O
a O
dignified O
circumstance O
as O
that O
, O
I O
say O
, O
was O
entitled O
to O
the O


pas O

over O
all O
minor O
occurrences O
wherof B-PERSON
this O
history O
is O
composed O


mainly O
, O
and O
hence O
a O
little O

was O


excusable O

Chapter B-LAW

as O
to O
have O
got O
our O
various O
characters O
up O
into O
their O


dressingrooms O
before O
the O

, O
which O
took O
place O
as O
usual O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O


Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
arrival O
. O


George B-PERSON
was O
too O
humane O
or O
too O
much O
occupied O
with O
the O
tie O
of O
his O
neckcloth O
to O


convey O
at O
once O
all O
the O
news O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
which O
his O
comrade O
had O
brought O
with O
him O


from O
London B-GPE
. O
He O
came O
into O
her O
room O
, O
however O
, O
holding O
the O
attorney O
’s O
letter O


in O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
with O
so O
solemn O
and O
important O
an O
air O
that O
his O
wife O
, O
always O


ingeniously O
on O
the O
watch O
for O
calamity O
, O
thought O
the O
worst O
was O
about O
to O


befall O
, O
and O
running O
up O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
besought O
her O
dearest O
George B-PERSON
to O
tell O


her O
everything O
— O
he O
was O
ordered O
abroad O
; O
there O
would O
be O
a O
battle O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
— O
she O


knew O
there O
would O

Dearest O
George B-PERSON
parried O
the O
question O
about O
foreign O
service O
, O
and O
with O
a O


melancholy O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
said O
, O
 O
No O
, O
Emmy B-PERSON
; O
it O
is O
n’t O
that O
: O
it O
’s O
not O
myself O


I O
care O
about O
: O
it O
’s O
you O
. O
I O
have O
had O
bad O
news O
from O
my O
father O
. O
He O
refuses O
any O


communication O
with O
me O
; O
he O
has O
flung O
us O
off O
; O
and O
leaves O
us O
to O
poverty O
. O


I O

can O
rough O
it O
well O
enough O
; O
but O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
how O
will O
you O
bear O


it O
? O
read O
here O
. O
 O
And O
he O
handed O
her O
over O
the O
letter O
. O


Amelia B-PERSON
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
tender O
alarm O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
listened O
to O
her O
noble O
hero O


as O
he O
uttered O
the O
above O
generous O
sentiments O
, O
and O
sitting O
down O
on O
the O
bed O
, O


read O
the O
letter O
which O
George B-PERSON
gave O
her O
with O
such O
a O
pompous O
martyr O
- O
like O
air O
. O


Her O
face O
cleared O
up O
as O
she O
read O
the O
document O
, O
however O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
sharing O


poverty O
and O
privation O
in O
company O
with O
the O
beloved O
object O
is O
, O
as O
we O
have O


before O
said O
, O
far O
from O
being O
disagreeable O
to O
a O
warm O
- O
hearted O
woman O
. O
The O
notion O


was O
actually O
pleasant O
to O
little O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
Then O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
she O
was O
ashamed O
of O


herself O
for O
feeling O
happy O
at O
such O
an O
indecorous O
moment O
, O
and O
checked O
her O


pleasure O
, O
saying O
demurely O
, O
 O
O O
, O
George B-PERSON
, O
how O
your O
poor O
heart O
must O
bleed O
at O
the O


idea O
of O
being O
separated O
from O
your O
papa O
! O
 O


 O
It O
does O
, O
 O
said O
George B-PERSON
, O
with O
an O
agonised O
countenance O
. O


 O
But O
he O
ca O
n’t O
be O
angry O
with O
you O
long O
, O
 O
she O
continued O
. O


 O
Nobody O
could O
, O
I O
’m O
sure O
. O
He O
must O
forgive O
you O
, O
my O
dearest O
, O
kindest O
husband O
. O


O O
, O
I O
shall O
never O
forgive O
myself O
if O
he O
does O
not O
. O
 O


 O
What O
vexes O
me O
, O
my O
poor O
Emmy B-PERSON
, O
is O
not O

my O

misfortune O
, O
but O
yours O
, O
 O


George B-PERSON
said O
. O
 O
I O
do O
n’t O
care O
for O
a O
little O
poverty O
; O
and O
I O
think O
, O
without O


vanity O
, O
I O
’ve O
talents O
enough O
to O
make O
my O
own O
way O
. O
 O


 O
That O
you O
have O
, O
 O
interposed O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
thought O
that O
war O
should O
cease O
, O


and O
her O
husband O
should O
be O
made O
a O
general O
instantly O
. O


 O
Yes O
, O
I O
shall O
make O
my O
way O
as O
well O
as O
another O
, O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
went O
on O
; O
 O
but O
you O
, O


my O
dear O
girl O
, O
how O
can O
I O
bear O
your O
being O
deprived O
of O
the O
comforts O
and O
station O


in O
society O
which O
my O
wife O
had O
a O
right O
to O
expect O
? O
My O
dearest O
girl O
in O
barracks O
; O


the O
wife O
of O
a O
soldier O
in O
a O
marching O
regiment O
; O
subject O
to O
all O
sorts O
of O


annoyance O
and O
privation O
! O
It O
makes O
me O
miserable O
. O
 O


Emmy O
, O
quite O
at O
ease O
, O
as O
this O
was O
her O
husband O
’s O
only O
cause O
of O
disquiet O
, O
took O


his O
hand O
, O
and O
with O
a O
radiant O
face O
and O
smile O
began O
to O
warble O
that O
stanza O
from O


the O
favourite O
song O
of O
 O
Wapping B-WORK_OF_ART
Old I-WORK_OF_ART
Stairs I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
 O
in O
which O
the O
heroine O
, O
after O


rebuking O
her O
Tom B-PERSON
for O
inattention O
, O
promises O
 O
his O
trowsers O
to O
mend O
, O
and O
his O


grog O
too O
to O
make O
, O
 O
if O
he O
will O
be O
constant O
and O
kind O
, O
and O
not O
forsake O
her O
. O


 O
Besides O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
during O
which O
she O
looked O
as O
pretty O
and O


happy O
as O
any O
young O
woman O
need O
, O
 O
is O

two B-QUANTITY

, O
George B-PERSON
? O
 O


George B-PERSON
laughed O
at O
her O
naveté O
; O
and O
finally O
they O
went O
down O
to O
dinner O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON


clinging O
to O
George B-PERSON
’s O
arm O
, O
still O
warbling O
the O
tune O
of O
 O
Wapping B-WORK_OF_ART
Old I-WORK_OF_ART
Stairs I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
 O


and O
more O
pleased O
and O
light O
of O
mind O
than O
she O
had O
been O
for O
some B-DATE
days I-DATE
past I-DATE
. O


Thus O
the O
repast O
, O
which O
at O
length O
came O
off O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
dismal O
, O
was O
an O


exceedingly O
brisk O
and O
merry O
one O
. O
The O
excitement O
of O
the O
campaign O
counteracted O


in O
George B-PERSON
’s O
mind O
the O
depression O
occasioned O
by O
the O
disinheriting O
letter O
. O


Dobbin B-PERSON
still O
kept O
up O
his O
character O
of O
rattle O
. O
He O
amused O
the O
company O
with O


accounts O
of O
the O
army O
in O
Belgium B-GPE
, O
where O
nothing O
but O
fêtes O
and O
gaiety O
and O


fashion O
were O
going O
on O
. O
Then O
, O
having O
a O
particular O
end O
in O
view O
, O
this O
dexterous O


captain O
proceeded O
to O
describe O
Mrs. O
Major O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
packing O
her O

her O


Major B-PERSON

wardrobe O
, O
and O
how O
his O
best O
epaulets O
had O
been O
stowed O
into O
a O
tea O


canister O
, O
whilst O
her O
own O
famous O
yellow O
turban O

with O
the O

was O
locked O
up O
in O
the O
Major O

and O
wondered O
what O

it O
would O
have O
at O
the O
French B-NORP
king O

at O

 O

 O
A O

over O

and O
George B-PERSON
, O


applauding O
her O

patted O
her O
under O

and O
asked O
all O
the O


persons O
present O
if O
they O
ever O
saw O
such O
a O
termagant O
of O
a O

agreed O
that O


the O

bear O
him O
company O

 O
We O
’ll O
have O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON

 O


he O
said O
. O
What O
cared O
she O
so O
long O
as O
her O
husband O
was O
near O
her O
? O
Thus O
somehow O


the O
bitterness O
of O
a O
parting O
was O
juggled O
away O
. O
Though O
war O
and O
danger O
were O
in O


store O
, O
war O
and O
danger O
might O
not O
befall O
for O
months B-DATE
to O
come O
. O
There O
was O
a O


respite O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
which O
made O
the O
timid O
little O
Amelia B-PERSON
almost O
as O
happy O
as O
a O


full O
reprieve O
would O
have O
done O
, O
and O
which O
even O
Dobbin B-PERSON
owned O
in O
his O
heart O
was O


very O
welcome O
. O
For O
, O
to O
be O
permitted O
to O
see O
her O
was O
now O
the O
greatest O
privilege O


and O
hope O
of O
his O
life O
, O
and O
he O
thought O
with O
himself O
secretly O
how O
he O
would O


watch O
and O
protect O
her O
. O
I O
would O
n’t O
have O
let O
her O
go O
if O
I O
had O
been O
married O
to O


her O
, O
he O
thought O
. O
But O
George B-PERSON
was O
the O
master O
, O
and O
his O
friend O
did O
not O
think O
fit O


to O
remonstrate O
. O


Putting O
her O
arm O
round O
her O
friend O
’s O
waist O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
at O
length O
carried O
Amelia B-PERSON


off O
from O
the O
dinner O

table O
where O
so O
much O
business O
of O
importance O
had O
been O


discussed O

and O
left O
the O
gentlemen O
in O
a O
highly O
exhilarated O
state O

drinking O


and O
talking O
very O
gaily O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
Rawdon B-PERSON
got O
a O
little O
family O

note O
from O
his O

which O
, O
although O
he O
crumpled O
it O
up O

burnt O
it O
instantly O
in O
the O
candle O
, O
we O


had O
the O
good O
luck O
to O
read O
over O
Rebecca B-PERSON

 O
Great O

So O
when O

was O
about O


adjourning O

coffee O
in O
the O

, O
Rawdon B-GPE
touched O
Osborne B-PERSON

gracefully O

 O
I O

 O
It O
was O
not O
quite O

but O
nevertheless O
George B-PERSON
gave O

a O

This O

George B-PERSON

Jos B-PERSON
, O
and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
held O
a O
council O
of O

over O

agreed O
that O

for O
London B-GPE


in O

Jos B-PERSON
, O
I O
think O

would O
have O
preferred O


staying O
until O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
quitted O
Brighton B-GPE
, O
but O
Dobbin B-PERSON
and O
George B-PERSON


overruled O
him O
, O
and O
he O
agreed O
to O
carry O
the O
party O
to O
town O
, O
and O
ordered O
four B-CARDINAL


horses O
, O
as O
became O
his O
dignity O
. O
With O
these O
they O
set O
off O
in O
state O
, O
after O


breakfast O
, O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE

. O
Amelia B-PERSON
had O
risen O
very O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O


packed O
her O
little O
trunks O
with O
the O
greatest O
alacrity O
, O
while O
Osborne B-PERSON
lay O
in O


bed O
deploring O
that O
she O
had O
not O
a O
maid O
to O
help O
her O
. O
She O
was O
only O
too O
glad O
, O


however O
, O
to O
perform O
this O
office O
for O
herself O
. O
A O
dim O
uneasy O
sentiment O
about O


Rebecca B-PERSON
filled O
her O
mind O
already O
; O
and O
although O
they O
kissed O
each O
other O
most O


tenderly O
at O
parting O
, O
yet O
we O
know O
what O
jealousy O
is O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Amelia B-PERSON
possessed O


that O
among O
other O
virtues O
of O
her O
sex O
. O


Besides O
these O
characters O
who O
are O
coming O
and O
going O
away O
, O
we O
must O
remember O


that O
there O
were O
some O
other O
old O
friends O
of O
ours O
at O
Brighton B-GPE
; O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O


namely O
, O
and O
the O
suite O
in O
attendance O
upon O
her O
. O
Now O
, O
although O
Rebecca B-PERSON
and O
her O


husband O
were O
but O
at O
a O
few O
stones O
’ O
throw O
of O
the O
lodgings O
which O
the O
invalid O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
occupied O
, O
the O
old O
lady O
’s O
door O
remained O
as O
pitilessly O
closed O
to O


them O
as O
it O
had O
been O
heretofore O
in O
London B-GPE
. O
As O
long O
as O
she O
remained O
by O
the O


side O
of O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
took O
care O
that O
her O
beloved O


Matilda B-ORG
should O
not O
be O
agitated O
by O
a O
meeting O
with O
her O
nephew O
. O
When O
the O


spinster B-PERSON
took O
her O
drive O
, O
the O
faithful O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
sate O
beside O
her O
in O
the O


carriage O
. O
When O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
took O
the O
air O
in O
a O
chair O
, O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
marched O
on O


one O
side O
of O
the O
vehicle O
, O
whilst O
honest O
Briggs B-PERSON
occupied O
the O
other O
wing O
. O
And O


if O
they O
met O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
by O
chance O
— O
although O
the O
former O
constantly O
and O


obsequiously O
took O
off O
his O
hat O
, O
the O
Miss O
- O
Crawley O
party O
passed O
him O
by O
with O


such O
a O
frigid O
and O
killing O
indifference O
, O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
began O
to O
despair O
. O


 O
We O
might O
as O
well O
be O
in O
London B-GPE
as O
here O
, O
 O
Captain O
Rawdon B-PERSON
often O
said O
, O
with O
a O


downcast O
air O
. O


 O
A O
comfortable O
inn O
in O
Brighton B-GPE
is O
better O
than O
a O
spunging O
- O
house O
in O
Chancery O


Lane O
, O
 O
his O
wife O
answered O
, O
who O
was O
of O
a O
more O
cheerful O
temperament O
. O
 O
Think O
of O


those O
two B-CARDINAL
aides O
- O
de O

camp O
of O
Mr. O
Moses B-PERSON
, O
the O
sheriff O

watched O
our O


lodging O
for O
a B-DATE

. O
Our O
friends O
here O
are O
very O
stupid O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Jos B-PERSON

Captain O

are O
better O
companions O
than O
Mr. O
Moses B-PERSON

men O
, O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
my O


love O
. O
 O


 O
I O
wonder O
the O
writs O
have O
n’t O
followed O
me O
down O
here O
, O
 O


Rawdon B-PERSON
continued O
, O
still O
desponding O
. O


 O
When O
they O
do O
, O
we O
’ll O
find O
means O
to O
give O
them O
the O
slip O
, O
 O
said O
dauntless O


little O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
and O
further O
pointed O
out O
to O
her O
husband O
the O
great O
comfort O
and O


advantage O
of O
meeting O
Jos B-ORG
and I-ORG
Osborne I-ORG
, O
whose O
acquaintance O
had O
brought O
to O


Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
a O
most O
timely O
little O
supply O
of O
ready O
money O
. O


 O
It O
will O
hardly O
be O
enough O
to O
pay O
the O
inn O
bill O
, O
 O
grumbled O
the O
Guardsman O
. O


 O
Why O
need O
we O
pay O
it O
? O
 O
said O
the O
lady O
, O
who O
had O
an O
answer O
for O
everything O
. O


Through O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
valet O
, O
who O
still O
kept O
up O
a O
trifling O
acquaintance O
with O
the O


male O
inhabitants O
of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
servants O
’ O
hall O
, O
and O
was O
instructed O
to O


treat O
the O
coachman O
to O
drink O
whenever O
they O
met O
, O
old O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
movements O


were O
pretty O
well O
known O
by O
our O
young O
couple O
; O
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
luckily O
bethought O


herself O
of O
being O
unwell O
, O
and O
of O
calling O
in O
the O
same O
apothecary O
who O
was O
in O


attendance O
upon O
the O
spinster O
, O
so O
that O
their O
information O
was O
on O
the O
whole O


tolerably O
complete O
. O
Nor O
was O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
although O
forced O
to O
adopt O
a O
hostile O


attitude O
, O
secretly O
inimical O
to O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
. O
She O
was O
naturally O
of O
a O


kindly O
and O
forgiving O
disposition O
. O
Now O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
jealousy O
was O


removed O
, O
her O
dislike O
for O
Rebecca B-PERSON
disappeared O
also O
, O
and O
she O
remembered O
the O


latter O
’s O
invariable O
good O
words O
and O
good O
humour O
. O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
and O
Mrs. O


Firkin B-PERSON
, O
the O
lady’s O
- O
maid O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
household O
, O
groaned O


under O
the O
tyranny O
of O
the O
triumphant O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
. O


As O
often O
will O
be O
the O
case O
, O
that O
good O
but O
imperious O
woman O
pushed O
her O


advantages O
too O
far O
, O
and O
her O
successes O
quite O
unmercifully O
. O
She O
had O
in O
the O


course O
of O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
brought O
the O
invalid O
to O
such O
a O
state O
of O
helpless O


docility O
, O
that O
the O
poor O
soul O
yielded O
herself O
entirely O
to O
her O
sister O
’s O


orders O
, O
and O
did O
not O
even O
dare O
to O
complain O
of O
her O
slavery O
to O
Briggs B-PERSON
or O


Firkin B-PERSON
. O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
measured O
out O
the O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O


daily B-DATE
allowed O
to O
take O
, O
with O
irresistible O
accuracy O
, O
greatly O
to O
the O
annoyance O


of O
Frikin B-PERSON
and O
the O
butler O
, O
who O
found O
themselves O
deprived O
of O
control O
over O
even O


the O
sherry O

She O

the O
sweet O

; O


their O
quantity O
and O

Night O
and O
noon B-TIME
and O
morning O
she O
brought O
the O


abominable O
drinks O
ordained O
by O
the O
Doctor O

and O
made O
her O
patient O
swallow O
them O


with O
so O
affecting O
an O
obedience O

that O
Firkin B-PERSON
said O
 O
my O
poor O
Missus B-PERSON

her O


physic O
like O

 O
She O
prescribed O
the O
drive O
in O
the O
carriage O
or O
the O
ride O
in O


the O
chair O
, O
and O
, O
in O
a O

ground O
down O
the O

in O


such O
a O

If O


ever O
the O

 O
Finally O

, O
and O
actually O
dive O
into O
that O
lady O
’s O
presence O
and O
surprise O
her O


under O
the O
sacredness O
of O
the O
awning O
, O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
determined O
to O
attack O
Briggs B-PERSON


as O
she O
came O
away O
from O
her O
bath O
, O
refreshed O
and O
invigorated O
by O
her O
dip O
, O
and O


likely O
to O
be O
in O
good O
humour O
. O


So O
getting O
up O
very O
early O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
brought O
the O
telescope O
in O


their O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
which O
faced O
the O
sea O
, O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
bathing O
- O
machines O


on O
the O
beach O
; O
saw O
Briggs B-PERSON
arrive O
, O
enter O
her O
box O
, O
and O
put O
out O
to O
sea O
; O
and O
was O


on O
the O
shore O
just O
as O
the O
nymph O
of O
whom O
she O
came O
in O
quest O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O


little O
caravan O
on O
to O
the O
shingles O
. O


It O
was O
a O
pretty O
picture O
: O
the O

; O
the O
bathing O
- O
women O
’s O
faces O
; O
the O
long O


line O
of O
rocks O
and O
buildings O
were O
blushing O
and O
bright O
in O
the O
sunshine O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
wore O
a O
kind O
, O
tender O
smile O
on O
her O
face O
, O
and O
was O
holding O
out O
her O


pretty O
white O
hand O
as O
Briggs B-PERSON
emerged O
from O
the O
box O
. O
What O
could O
Briggs B-PERSON
do O
but O


accept O
the O
salutation O
? O


 O
Miss O
Sh O
— O
, O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
said O
. O


Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
seized O
her O
hand O
, O
pressed O
it O
to O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
with O
a O
sudden O


impulse O
, O
flinging O
her O
arms O
round O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
kissed O
her O
affectionately O
. O
 O
Dear O
, O


dear O
friend O
! O
 O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
such O
natural O
feeling O
, O
that O
Miss O


Briggs B-PERSON
of O
course O
at O
once O
began O
to O
melt O
, O
and O
even O
the O
bathing O
- O
woman O
was O


mollified O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
found O
no O
difficulty O
in O
engaging O
Briggs B-PERSON
in O
a O
long O
, O
intimate O
, O
and O


delightful O
conversation O
. O
Everything O
that O
had O
passed O
since O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
of O


Becky B-PERSON
’s O
sudden O
departure O
from O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON

house O
in O
Park B-GPE
Lane I-GPE
up O
to O
the O


present O
day O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
’s O
happy O
retreat O
, O
was O
discussed O
and O
described O
by O


Briggs B-PERSON
. O
All O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
symptoms O
, O
and O
the O
particulars O
of O
her O
illness O
and O


medical O
treatment O
, O
were O
narrated O
by O
the O
confidante O
with O
that O
fulness O
and O


accuracy O
which O
women O
delight O
in O
. O
About O
their O
complaints O
and O
their O
doctors O
do O


ladies O
ever O
tire O
of O
talking O
to O
each O
other O
? O
Briggs B-PERSON
did O
not O
on O
this O
occasion O
; O


nor O
did O
Rebecca B-PERSON
weary O
of O
listening O
. O
She O
was O
thankful O
, O
truly O
thankful O
, O
that O


the O
dear O
kind O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
that O
the O
faithful O
, O
the O
invaluable O
Firkin B-PERSON
, O
had O
been O


permitted O
to O
remain O
with O
their O
benefactress O
through O
her O
illness O
. O
Heaven O


bless O
her O
! O
though O
she O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
had O
seemed O
to O
act O
undutifully O
towards O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
; O
yet O
was O
not O
her O
fault O
a O
natural O
and O
excusable O
one O
? O
Could O
she O
help O


giving O
her O
hand O
to O
the O
man O
who O
had O
won O
her O
heart O
? O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
the O
sentimental O
, O


could O
only O
turn O
up O
her O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
at O
this O
appeal O
, O
and O
heave O
a O


sympathetic O
sigh O
, O
and O
think O
that O
she O
, O
too O
, O
had O
given O
away O
her O
affections O


long O
years B-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
and O
own O
that O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
no O
very O
great O
criminal O
. O


 O
Can O
I O
ever O
forget O
her O
who O
so O
befriended O
the O
friendless O
orphan O
? O
No O
, O
though O


she O
has O
cast O
me O
off O
, O
 O
the O
latter O
said O
, O
 O
I O
shall O
never O
cease O
to O
love O
her O
, O
and O


I O
would O
devote O
my O
life O
to O
her O
service O
. O
As O
my O
own O
benefactress O
, O
as O
my O
beloved O


Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
adored O
relative O
, O
I O
love O
and O
admire O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
dear O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O


beyond O
any O
woman O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
next O
to O
her O
I O
love O
all O
those O
who O
are O


faithful O
to O
her O
. O

I O

would O
never O
have O
treated O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
faithful O


friends O
as O
that O
odious O
designing O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
has O
done O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
all O


heart O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
continued O
, O
 O
although O
his O
outward O
manners O
might O
seem O
rough O


and O
careless O
, O
had O
said O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
times O
, O
with O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
that O
he O


blessed O
Heaven O
for O
sending O
his O
dearest O
Aunty O
two B-CARDINAL
such O
admirable O
nurses O
as O


her O
attached O
Firkin B-PERSON
and O
her O
admirable O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
. O
Should O
the O
Machinations O


of O
the O
horrible O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
end O
, O
as O
she O
too O
much O
feared O
they O
would O
, O
in O


banishing O
everybody O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
loved O
from O
her O
side O
, O
and O
leaving O
that O


poor O
lady O
a O
victim O
to O
those O
harpies O
at O
the O
Rectory B-PERSON
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
besought O
her O


( O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
) O
to O
remember O
that O
her O
own O
home O
, O
humble O
as O
it O
was O
, O
was O
always O


open O
to O
receive O
Briggs B-PERSON
. O
Dear O
friend O
, O
 O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
in O
a O
transport O
of O


enthusiasm O
, O

 O
some O

hearts O
can O

never O

forget O
benefits O
; O


all O

women O
are O
not O
Bute B-ORG
Crawleys I-ORG
! O
Though O
why O
should O
I O
complain O


of O
her O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
added O
; O
 O
though O
I O
have O
been O
her O
tool O
and O
the O
victim O
to O
her O


arts O
, O
do O
I O
not O
owe O
my O
dearest O
Rawdon B-PERSON
to O
her O
? O
 O
And O
Rebecca B-PERSON
unfolded O
to O
Briggs B-PERSON


all O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
’s O
conduct O
at O
Queen B-PERSON
’s O
Crawley B-GPE
, O
which O
, O
though O
unintelligible O
to O


her O
then O
, O
was O
clearly O
enough O
explained O
by O
the O
events O
now,—now O
that O
the O


attachment O
had O
sprung O
up O
which O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
had O
encouraged O
by O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL


artifices,—now O
that O
two B-CARDINAL
innocent O
people O
had O
fallen O
into O
the O
snares O
which O
she O


had O
laid O
for O
them O
, O
and O
loved O
and O
married O
and O
been O
ruined O
through O
her O


schemes O
. O


It O
was O
all O
very O
true O
. O
Briggs B-PERSON
saw O
the O
stratagems O
as O
clearly O
as O
possible O
. O


Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
had O
made O
the O
match O
between O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
Yet O
, O
though O
the O


latter O
was O
a O
perfectly O
innocent O
victim O
, O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
could O
not O
disguise O
from O


her O
friend O
her O
fear O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
affections O
were O
hopelessly O
estranged O


from O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
the O
old O
lady O
would O
never O
forgive O
her O
nephew O
for O


making O
so O
imprudent O
a O
marriage O
. O


On O
this O
point O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
her O
own O
opinion O
, O
and O
still O
kept O
up O
a O
good O
heart O
. O


If O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
did O
not O
forgive O
them O
at O
present O
, O
she O
might O
at O
least O
relent O


on O
a B-DATE
future I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
Even O
now O
, O
there O
was O
only O
that O
puling O
, O
sickly O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley O


between O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
a O
baronetcy O
; O
and O
should O
anything O
happen O
to O
the O
former O
, O


all O
would O
be O
well O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
to O
have O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
’s O
designs O
exposed O
, O
and O


herself O
well O
abused O
, O
was O
a O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
might O
be O
advantageous O
to O


Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
interests O
; O
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
after O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
’s O
chat O
with O
her O
recovered O


friend O
, O
left O
her O
with O
the O
most O
tender O
demonstrations O
of O
regard O
, O
and O
quite O


assured O
that O
the O
conversation O
they O
had O
had O
together O
would O
be O
reported O
to O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
before B-TIME
many I-TIME
hours I-TIME
were O
over O
. O


This O
interview O
ended O
, O
it O
became O
full O
time O
for O
Rebecca B-PERSON
to O
return O
to O
her O
inn O
, O


where O
all O
the O
party O
of O
the B-DATE
previous I-DATE
day I-DATE
were O
assembled O
at O
a O
farewell O


breakfast O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
took O
such O
a O
tender O
leave O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
as O
became O
two B-CARDINAL
women O


who O
loved O
each O
other O
as O
sister O
; O
and O
having O
used O
her O
handkerchief O


plentifully O
, O
and O
hung O
on O
her O
friend O
’s O
neck O
as O
if O
they O
were O
parting O
for O
ever O
, O


and O
waved O
the O
handkerchief O
( O
which O
was O
quite O
dry O
, O
by O
the O
way O
) O
out O
of O
window O
, O


as O
the O
carriage O
drove O
off O
, O
she O
came O
back O
to O
the O
breakfast O
table O
, O
and O
ate O


some O
prawns O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
appetite O
, O
considering O
her O
emotion O
; O
and O
while O


she O
was O
munching O
these O
delicacies O
, O
explained O
to O
Rawdon B-PERSON
what O
had O
occurred O
in O


her O
morning B-TIME
walk O
between O
herself O
and O
Briggs B-PERSON
. O
Her O
hopes O
were O
very O
high O
: O
she O


made O
her O
husband O
share O
them O
. O
She O
generally O
succeeded O
in O
making O
her O
husband O


share O
all O
her O
opinions O
, O
whether O
melancholy O
or O
cheerful O
. O


 O
You O
will O
now O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
sit O
down O
at O
the O
writing O
- O
table O
and O


pen O
me O
a O
pretty O
little O
letter O
to O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
in O
which O
you O
say O
that O
you O
are O


a O
good O
boy O
, O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O
 O
So O
Rawdon B-PERSON
sate O
down O
, O
and O
wrote O
off O
, O


 O
Brighton B-GPE
, O
Thursday B-DATE
, O
 O
and O
 O
My O
dear O
Aunt O
, O
 O
with O
great O
rapidity O
: O
but O
there O
the O


gallant O
officer O
’s O
imagination O
failed O
him O
. O
He O
mumbled O
the O
end O
of O
his O
pen O
, O
and O


looked O
up O
in O
his O
wife O
’s O
face O
. O
She O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
at O
his O
rueful O


countenance O
, O
and O
marching O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
with O
her O
hands O
behind O
her O
, O


the O
little O
woman O
began O
to O
dictate O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
he O
took O
down O
. O


 O
Before O
quitting O
the O
country O
and O
commencing O
a O
campaign O
, O
which O
very O
possibly O


may O
be O
fatal O
, O
 O


 O
What O
? O
 O
said O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
rather O
surprised O
, O
but O
took O
the O
humour O
of O
the O
phrase O
, O


and O
presently O
wrote O
it O
down O
with O
a O
grin O
. O


 O
Which O
very O
possibly O
may O
be O
fatal O
, O
I O
have O
come O
hither O
— O
 O


 O
Why O
not O
say O
come O
here O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
? O
come O
here O
’s O
grammar O
, O
 O
the O
dragoon O


interposed O
. O


 O
I O
have O
come O
hither O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
insisted O
, O
with O
a O
stamp O
of O
her O
foot O
, O
 O
to O
say O


farewell O
to O
my O
dearest O
and O
earliest O
friend O
. O
I O
beseech O
you O
before O
I O
go O
, O
not O


perhaps O
to O
return O
, O
once O
more O
to O
let O
me O
press O
the O
hand O
from O
which O
I O
have O


received O
nothing O
but O
kindnesses O
all O
my O
life O
. O
 O


 O
Kindnesses B-PERSON
all O
my O
life O
, O
 O
echoed O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
scratching O
down O
the O
words O
, O
and O


quite O
amazed O
at O
his O
own O
facility O
of O
composition O
. O


 O
I O
ask O
nothing O
from O
you O
but O
that O
we O
should O
part O
not O
in O
anger O
. O
I O
have O
the O


pride O
of O
my O
family O
on O
some O
points O
, O
though O
not O
on O
all O
. O
I O
married O
a O
painter O

daughter O
, O
and O
am O
not O
ashamed O
of O
the O
union O
. O
 O


 O
No O
, O
run O
me O
through O
the O
body O
if O
I O
am O

 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
ejaculated O
. O


 O
You O
old O
booby O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
, O
pinching O
his O
ear O
and O
looking O
over O
to O
see O


that O
he O
made O
no O
mistakes O
in O
spelling—beseech B-ORG
is O
not O
spelt O
with O
an O
a O

and O


earliest O

 O
So O
he O
altered O
these O
words O
, O
bowing O
to O
the O
superior O
knowledge O
of O


his O
little O
Missis B-ORG
. O


 O
I O
thought O
that O
you O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
progress O
of O
my O
attachment O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON


continued O
: O
 O
I O
knew O
that O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
confirmed O
and O
encouraged O
it O
. O
But O
I O


make O
no O
reproaches O
. O
I O
married O
a O
poor O
woman O

and O
am O
content O
to O
abide O
by O
what O


I O
have O
done O

Leave O
your O

I O

shall O


never O
complain O
of O
the O
way O

which O
you O
dispose O

it O

I O
would O
have O
you O


believe O
that O
I O
love O
you O
for O
yourself O
, O
and O
not O
for O
money O
’s O
sake O

I O
want O
to O
be O


reconciled O
to O
you O
ere O
I O
leave O
England B-GPE
. O
Let O
me O
, O
let O
me O
see O
you O
before O
I O
go O

A O


few O
weeks O
or O
months B-DATE
hence O
it O
may O
to O

and O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
the O
notion O


of O
quitting O
the O
country O
without O
a O
kind O
word O
of O
farewell O
from O
you O

 O


 O
She O
wo O
n’t O
recognise O
my O
style O
in O

that O
, O
 O

said O
Becky B-PERSON
. O
 O
I O
have O
made O


the O
sentences O
short O
and O
brisk O
on O
purpose O

 O
And O
this O
authentic O
missive O
was O


despatched O
under O
cover O
to O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON

Old O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
laughed O
when O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
with O
great O
mystery O
, O
handed O
her O
over O


this O
candid O
and O
simple O
statement O
. O


 O
We O

 O


When O

 O
Do O

to O
Briggs B-PERSON

 O
Do O

you O
see O
that O


Rawdon B-PERSON
never O

it O

He O
never O
wrote O
to O
me O
without O
asking O
for O


money O
in O
his O
life O
, O
and O
all O
his O
letters O
are O
full O
of O
bad O
spelling O
, O
and O
dashes O


and O
bad O
grammar O
. O
It O
is O
that O
little O
serpent O
of O
a O
governess O
who O
rules O
him O
. O
 O


They O
are O
all O
alike O
, O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
thought O
in O
her O
heart O
. O
They O
all O
want O
me O


dead O
, O
and O
are O
hankering O
for O
my O
money O

 O
I O
do O
n’t O
mind O
seeing O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
added O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
of O


perfect O
indifference O

 O
I O
had O
just O
as O
soon O
shake O
hands O
with O
him O
as O
not O

Provided O
there O
is O
no O
scene O

why O
should O
n’t O
we O
meet O

I O
do O

But O
human O


patience O

its O

my O

I O
respectfully O
decline O

Mrs. O

I O

that O

quite—and B-ORG
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O


fain O
to O
be O
content O
with O
this O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
message O
of O
conciliation O
; O
and O
thought O
that O


the O
best O
method O
of O
bringing O
the O
old O
lady O
and O
her O
nephew O
together O
, O
was O
to O


warn O
Rawdon B-PERSON
to O
be O
in O
waiting O
on O
the O
Cliff O
, O
when O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
went O
out O
for O


her O
air O
in O
her O
chair O

There O
they O
met O
. O
I O
do O

know O
whether O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
any O
private O
feeling O


of O
regard O

emotion O
upon O
seeing O
her O
old O

; O
but O
she O
held O
out O
a O


couple O
of O
fingers O
to O
him O
with O
as O
smiling O
and O
good O
- O
humoured O
an O
air O
, O
as O
if O


they O
had O
met O
only B-DATE
the I-DATE
day I-DATE

And O
as O
for O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
he O
turned O
as O
red O
as O


scarlet O
, O
and O
wrung O
off O
Briggs B-ORG
’s O
hand O
, O
so O
great O
was O
his O
rapture O
and O
his O


confusion O
at O
the O
meeting O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
interest O
that O
moved O
him O
: O
or O
perhaps O


affection O
: O
perhaps O
he O
was O
touched O
by O
the O
change O
which O
the O
illness O
of O
the O


last B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
had O
wrought O
in O
his O
aunt O

 O
The O
old O
girl O
has O
always O
acted O
like O
a O
trump O
to O
me O
, O
 O
he O
said O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
as O


he O
narrated O
the O
interview O
, O
 O
and O
I O
felt O
, O
you O
know O
, O
rather O
queer O
, O
and O
that O


sort O
of O
thing O

I O
walked O
by O

 O
No O

 O


 O

 O
Perhaps O
I O

was O

a O
fool O

Becky B-PERSON
, O
but O
you O
should O

so O
; O
 O

he O


gave O
his O

a O
look O

such O
as O
his O

such O

angry O


yoke O

On O
which O
he O
replied O

that O

would O
just O
thank O
her O
to O

at O

to O
his O

superior O

by O
the O

confirmation O

she O
had O
regarding O
the O
consequences O


of O
the O
mistake O
which O
he O

Miss O

who O
remonstrated O
after O
dinner O
, O
when O
Jos B-PERSON
was O


asleep O
in O
the O
great O
chair O
. O
But O
, O
in O
vain O
he O
cried O
out O
against O
the O
enormity O
of O


turtle O
and O
champagne O
that O
was O
fit O
for O
an O
archbishop O
. O
 O
I O
’ve O
always O
been O


accustomed O
to O
travel O
like O
a O
gentleman O
, O
 O
George B-PERSON
said O
, O
 O
and O
, O
damme O
, O
my O
wife O


shall O
travel O
like O
a O
lady O

As O
long O
as O
there O
’s O
a O
shot O
in O
the O
locker O
, O


she O

shall O
want O
for O
nothing O
, O
 O
said O
the O
generous O
fellow O
, O
quite O


pleased O
with O
himself O
for O
his O
magnificence O
of O
spirit O
. O
Nor O
did O
Dobbin B-PERSON
try O
and O


convince O
him O
that O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
happiness O
was O
not O
centred O
in O
turtle O
- O
soup O
. O


A O
while O
after O
dinner O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
timidly O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
go O
and O
see O
her O


mamma O
, O
at O
Fulham B-ORG
: O
which O
permission O
George B-PERSON
granted O
her O
with O
some O
grumbling O
. O


And O
she O
tripped O
away O
to O
her O
enormous O
bedroom O
, O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
which O
stood O


the O
enormous O
funereal O
bed O
 O
that O
the O
Emperor O
Halixander B-PERSON
’s O
sister O
slep O
in O
when O


the O
allied O
sufferings O
was O
here O
, O
 O
and O
put O
on O
her O
little O
bonnet O
and O
shawl O
with O


the O
utmost O
eagerness O
and O
pleasure O
. O
George B-PERSON
was O
still O
drinking O
claret O
when O
she O


returned O
to O
the O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
and O
made O
no O
signs O
of O
moving O
. O
 O
Ar’n’t O
you O
coming O


with O
me O
, O
dearest O
? O
 O
she O
asked O
him O
. O
No O
; O
the O
 O
dearest O
 O
had O
 O
business O
 O
that O


night O
. O
His O
man O
should O
get O
her O
a O
coach O
and O
go O
with O
her O
. O
And O
the O
coach O
being O


at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
hotel O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
made O
George B-PERSON
a O
little O
disappointed O
curtsey O


after O
looking O
vainly O
into O
his O
face O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
and O
went O
sadly O
down O
the O


great O
stair O
- O
case O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
after O
, O
who O
handed O
her O
into O
the O
vehicle O
, O
and O


saw O
it O
drive O
away O
to O
its O
destination O
. O
The O
very O
valet O
was O
ashamed O
of O


mentioning O
the O
address O
to O
the O
hackney O
- O
coachman O
before O
the O
hotel O
waiters O
, O
and O


promised O
to O
instruct O
him O
when O
they O
got O
further O
on O
. O


Dobbin B-PERSON
walked O
home O
to O
his O
old O
quarters O
at O
the O
Slaughters O
’ O
thinking O
very O


likely O
that O
it O
would O
be O
delightful O
to O
be O
in O
that O
hackney O
- O
coach O
, O
along O
with O


Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
. O
George B-PERSON
was O
evidently O
of O
quite O
a O
different O
taste O
; O
for O
when O
he O


had O
taken O
wine O
enough O
, O
he O
went O
off O
to O
half B-CARDINAL

at O
the O
play O
, O
to O
see O
Mr. O


Kean B-PERSON
perform O
in O
Shylock B-PERSON

Captain O
Osborne B-PERSON
was O
a O
great O
lover O
of O
the O
drama O
, O
and O


had O
himself O
performed O
high O
- O
comedy O
characters O
with O
great O
distinction O
in O


several O
garrison O
theatrical O
entertainments O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
slept O
on O
until O
long O
after O


dark O
, O
when O
he O
woke O
up O
with O
a O
start O
at O
the O
motions O
of O
his O
servant O
, O
who O
was O


removing O
and O
emptying O
the O
decanters O
on O
the O
table O
; O
and O
the O

was O
again O
put O
into O

for O
a O

to O
convey O
this O
stout O


hero O
to O
his O
lodgings O
and O
bed O
. O


Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
, O
clasped O
her O
daughter O
to O
her O
heart O
with O
all O


maternal O
eagerness O
and O
affection O
, O
running O
out O
of O
the O
door O
as O
the O
carriage O


drew O
up O
before O
the O
little O
garden O

, O
to O
welcome O
the O
weeping O
, O

, O


young O

Old O

, O
who O
was O
in O
his O

trimming O
the O

, O
shrank O
back O
alarmed O

The O
Irish B-NORP
servant O
- O
lass O
rushed O
up O
from O
the O


kitchen O
and O
smiled O
a O
 O
God O
bless O
you O
. O
 O
Amelia B-PERSON
could O
hardly O
walk O
along O
the O


flags O
and O
up O
the O
steps O
into O
the O
parlour O
. O


How O
the O
floodgates O
were O
opened O
, O
and O
mother O
and O
daughter O
wept O
, O
when O
they O


were O
together O
embracing O
each O
other O
in O
this O
sanctuary O
, O
may O
readily O
be O


imagined O
by O
every O
reader O
who O
possesses O
the O

sentimental O
turn O

When O


do O

ladies O
weep O
? O
At O
what O
occasion O
of O
joy O
, O
sorrow O
, O

life O
? O
and O
, O
after O
such O
an O
event O
as O
a O
marriage O
, O
mother O
and O

were O


surely O
at O
liberty O
to O
give O
way O
to O
a O
sensibility O
which O
is O
as O
tender O
as O
it O
is O


refreshing O

About O
a O
question O
of O
marriage O
I O
have O
seen O
women O
who O
hate O
each O


other O
kiss O
and O

together O
quite O
fondly O

How O
much O
more O
do O
they O
feel O
when O


they O

not O

grandmothers O
are?—in O

a O
woman O

until O

does O
not O


often O

what O
to O

Let O
us O

Amelia B-PERSON

whispering O

laughing O

crying O
in O
the O

Old O

He O

had O
not O
divined O
who O

up O

He O

not O

he O
kissed O
her O
very O
warmly O
when O

he O
very O
wisely O
left O

George B-PERSON

was O
looking O
on O
in O
a O
very O
supercilious O
manner O
at O
Mr. O
Clapp B-PERSON
in O


his O

, O
watering O
his O

He O
took O
off O
his O

, O
however O
, O


with O
much O
condescension O
to O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
who O
asked O
news O
about O
his O
son O

about O
Jos B-PERSON

about O

; O
until O
the O

with O
a O

a O
bottle O
of O

from O
which O
the O

gentleman O
insisted O
upon O
helping O
the O

He O
gave O
him O
a O
half O

There O
were O

nine B-DATE
days I-DATE

Amelia B-PERSON
had O
left O
that O
little O

home O

and O
yet O
how O
far O
off O
the O
time O
seemed O
since O
she O
had O
bidden O
it O
farewell O

What O
a O
gulf O
lay O
between O
her O
and O
that O
past O

She O
could O
look O

contemplate O

almost O
as O

the O

ungratefully O

at O

her O

To O
review O
those B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
so O
lately O
gone O


yet O
so O
far O
away O
, O
touched O
her O
with O
shame O
; O
and O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
kind O
parents O


filled O
her O
with O
tender O
remorse O

Was O
the O
prize O
gained O

the O
heaven O

and O


the O

still O
doubtful O

unsatisfied O

As O
his O
hero O
and O
heroine O
pass O
the O


matrimonial O
barrier O
, O
the O
novelist O
generally O
drops O
the O
curtain O
, O
as O
if O
the O


drama O
were O
over O
then O
: O
the O
doubts O
and O
struggles O
of O
life O
ended O
: O
as O
if O
, O
once O


landed O
in O
the O
marriage O
country O
, O
all O
were O
green O
and O
pleasant O
there O
: O
and O
wife O


and O
husband O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
to O
link O
each O
other O

arms O
together O
, O
and O


wander O
gently O
downwards O
towards O
old O
age O
in O
happy O
and O
perfect O
fruition O
. O
But O


our O
little O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
just O
on O
the O
bank O
of O
her O
new O
country O
, O
and O
was O
already O


looking O
anxiously O
back O
towards O
the O
sad O
friendly O
figures O
waving O
farewell O
to O


her O
across O
the O
stream O
, O
from O
the O
other O
distant O
shore O
. O


In O
honour O
of O
the O
young O
bride O
’s O
arrival O
, O
her O
mother O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O


prepare O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
festive O
entertainment O
, O
and O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL


ebullition O
of O
talk O
, O
took O
leave O
of O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
dived O


down O
to O
the O
lower O
regions O
of O
the O
house O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
kitchen O

parlour O


( O
occupied O
by O
Mr. O

Mrs. O

and O
in O
the O
evening O

when O
her O
dishes O
were O


washed O
and O
her O
curl O

papers O
removed O

by O
Miss O
Flannigan B-PERSON
, O
the O

) O
, O


there O
to O
take O
measures O
for O
the O
preparing O
of O
a O
magnificent O
ornamented O
tea O
. O


All O
people O
have O
their O
ways O
of O
expressing O
kindness O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
Mrs. O


Sedley B-PERSON
that O
a O
muffin O
and O
a O
quantity O
of O
orange O
marmalade O
spread O
out O
in O
a O


little O
cut O
- O
glass O
saucer O
would O
be O
peculiarly O
agreeable O
refreshments O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON


in O
her O
most O
interesting O
situation O
. O


While O
these O
delicacies O
were O
being O
transacted O
below O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
leaving O
the O


drawing O
- O
room O
, O
walked O
up O
stairs O
and O
found O
herself O
, O
she O
scarce O
knew O
how O
, O
in O


the O
little O
room O
which O
she O
had O
occupied O
before O
her O
marriage O
, O
and O
in O
that O
very O


chair O
in O
which O
she O
had O
passed O
so O
many O
bitter O
hours O
. O
She O
sank O
back O
in O
its O


arms O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
old O
friend O
; O
and O
fell O
to O
thinking O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
, O


and O
the O
life O
beyond O
it O
. O
Already O
to O
be O
looking O
sadly O
and O
vaguely O
back O
: O
always O


to O
be O
pining O
for O
something O
which O
, O
when O
obtained O
, O
brought O
doubt O
and O
sadness O


rather O
than O
pleasure O
; O
here O
was O
the O
lot O
of O
our O
poor O
little O
creature O
, O
and O


harmless O
lost O
wanderer O
in O
the O
great O
struggling O
crowds O
of O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG
. O


Here O
she O
sate O
, O
and O
recalled O
to O
herself O
fondly O
that O
image O
of O
George B-PERSON
to O
which O


she O
had O
knelt O
before O
marriage O
. O
Did O
she O
own O
to O
herself O
how O
different O
the O
real O


man O
was O
from O
that O
superb O
young O
hero O
whom O
she O
had O
worshipped O
? O
It O
requires O


many O
, O
many O
years O
— O
and O
a O
man O
must O
be O
very O
bad O
indeed O
— O
before O
a O
woman O
’s O
pride O


and O
vanity O
will O
let O
her O
own O
to O
such O
a O
confession O
. O
Then O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
twinkling O


green O
eyes O
and O
baleful O
smile O
lighted O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
filled O
her O
with O
dismay O
. O


And O
so O
she O
sate O
for O
awhile O
indulging O
in O
her O
usual O
mood O
of O
selfish O
brooding O
, O


in O
that O
very O
listless O
melancholy O
attitude O
in O
which O
the O
honest O
maid O
- O
servant O


had O
found O
her O
, O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
she O
brought O
up O
the O
letter O
in O
which O
George B-PERSON


renewed O
his O
offer O
of O
marriage O
. O


She O
looked O
at O
the O
little O
white O
bed O
, O
which O
had O
been O
hers O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
before I-DATE
, O


and O
thought O
she O
would O
like O
to O
sleep O
in O
it O
that O
night O
, O
and O
wake O
, O
as O
formerly O
, O


with O
her O
mother O
smiling O
over O
her O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
Then O
she O
thought O
with O


terror O
of O
the O
great O
funereal O
damask O
pavilion O
in O
the O
vast O
and O
dingy O
state O


bed O
- O
room O
, O
which O
was O
awaiting O
her O
at O
the O
grand O
hotel O
in O
Cavendish B-FAC
Square I-FAC

Dear O
little O
white O
bed O
! O
how O
many O
a O
long O
night O
had O
she O
wept O
on O
its O
pillow O
! O
How O


she O
had O
despaired O
and O
hoped O
to O
die O
there O
; O
and O
now O
were O
not O
all O
her O
wishes O


accomplished O
, O
and O
the O
lover O
of O
whom O
she O
had O
despaired O
her O
own O
for O
ever O
? O
Kind O


mother O
! O
how O
patiently O
and O
tenderly O
she O
had O
watched O
round O
that O
bed O
! O
She O
went O


and O
knelt O
down O
by O
the O
bed O
- O
side O
; O
and O
there O
this O
wounded O
and O
timorous O
, O
but O


gentle O
and O
loving O
soul O
, O
sought O
for O
consolation O
where O
as O
yet O
, O
it O
must O
be O


owned O
, O
our O
little O
girl O
had O
but O
seldom O
looked O
for O
it O
. O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
had O
been O
her O
faith O


hitherto O
; O
and O
the O
sad O
, O
bleeding O
disappointed O
heart O
began O
to O
feel O
the O
want O
of O


another O
consoler O
. O


Have O
we O
a O
right O
to O
repeat O
or O
to O
overhear O
her O
prayers O
? O
These O
, O

are O

out O

But O
this O
may O
be O
said O

that O
when O
the O

was O
finally O
announced O
, O
our O
young O


lady O
came O
downstairs O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
cheerful O
; O
that O
she O
did O
not O
despond O

or O
deplore O
her O
fate O
, O
or O
think O
about O
George B-PERSON

coldness O

Rebecca B-PERSON

eyes O
, O
as O


she O
had O
been O

of O

She O
went O
downstairs O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
father O


and O
mother O
, O
and O
talked O
to O
the O
old O
gentleman O
, O
and O
made O
him O
more O
merry O
than O
he O


had O
been O
for O
many O
a O
day O
. O
She O
sate O
down O
at O
the O
piano O
which O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
bought O


for O
her O
, O
and O
sang O
over O
all O
her O
father O

favourite O
old O
songs O
. O
She O
pronounced O


the O
tea O
to O
be O
excellent O
, O
and O
praised O
the O
exquisite O
taste O
in O
which O
the O


marmalade O
was O
arranged O
in O
the O
saucers O
. O
And O
in O
determining O
to O
make O
everybody O


else O
happy O
, O
she O
found O
herself O
so O
; O
and O
was O
sound O
asleep O
in O
the O
great O
funereal O


pavilion O
, O
and O
only O
woke O
up O
with O
a O
smile O
when O
George B-PERSON
arrived O
from O
the O


theatre O

For O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
George B-PERSON
had O
more O
important O
 O
business O
 O
to O
transact O
than O


that O
which O
took O
him O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Kean B-PERSON
in O
Shylock B-PERSON
. O
Immediately O
on O
his O
arrival O


in O
London B-GPE
he O
had O
written O
off O
to O
his O
father O

solicitors O
, O
signifying O
his O


royal O
pleasure O
that O
an O
interview O
should O
take O
place O
between O
them O
on O
the O


morrow B-DATE
. O
His O
hotel O
bill O
, O
losses O
at O
billiards O
and O
cards O
to O
Captain O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O


almost O
drained O
the O
young O
man O
’s O
purse O
, O
which O
wanted O
replenishing O
before O
he O


set O
out O
on O
his O
travels O
, O
and O
he O
had O
no O
resource O
but O
to O
infringe O
upon O
the O
two B-QUANTITY


thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
which O
the O
attorneys O
were O
commissioned O
to O
pay O
over O
to O
him O
. O
He O


had O
a O
perfect O
belief O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
that O
his O
father O
would O
relent O
before O


very O
long O
. O
How O
could O
any O
parent O
be O
obdurate O
for O
a O
length O
of O
time O
against O


such O
a O
paragon O
as O
he O
was O
? O
If O
his O
mere O
past O
and O
personal O
merits O
did O
not O


succeed O
in O
mollifying O
his O
father O
, O
George B-PERSON
determined O
that O
he O
would O


distinguish O
himself O
so O
prodigiously O
in O
the O
ensuing O
campaign O
that O
the O
old O


gentleman O
must O
give O
in O
to O
him O
. O
And O
if O
not O
? O
Bah O
! O
the O
world O
was O
before O
him O
. O


His O
luck O
might O
change O
at O
cards O

and O
there O
was O
a O
deal O
of O
spending O
in O
two B-QUANTITY


thousand I-QUANTITY

So O
he O
sent O
off O
Amelia B-PERSON

with O
strict O

but O
if O

was O

the O

But O
all O
the O

round O
their O


comrade O

paid O
her O

She O
had O
a O
little O

George B-PERSON
was O
proud O
of O
her O
popularity O

pleased O
with O
the O
manner O


( O
which O
was O
very O
gay O

naive O

a O
little O

she O
received O

And O
he O
in O

how O

She O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
affectionately O

pleasure O

his O
kindness O

 O
I O
will O

 O


The O

Old O

the O

made O


one B-CARDINAL

two B-CARDINAL

which O
, O
being O
professional O
, O
need O
not O
be O
repeated O
; O
and O


Cackle B-PERSON
, O
the O
Assistant O
M.D. O
of O
Edinburgh B-GPE
, O
condescended O
to O
examine O
her O
upon O


leeterature O

tried O
her O
with O
his O
three B-CARDINAL
best O
French B-NORP

Young O

 O

never O

when O
the O

As O
for O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
he O
never O
so O
much O
as O
spoke O
to O
her O
during O
the O
whole O


evening O

But O
he O
and O
Captain O
Porter B-PERSON
of O
the O
150th B-ORDINAL
took O
home O
Jos B-PERSON
to O
the O
hotel O

who O
was O
in O
a O
very O
maudlin O
state O

Having O
put O
the O

into O
the O


hands O

his O

Dobbin B-PERSON
loitered O
about O
, O
smoking O
his O
cigar O
before O
the O


inn O

George B-PERSON
had O
meanwhile O
very O
carefully O
shawled O
his O
wife O

brought O


her O
away O

Mrs. O

a O
general O
handshaking O
from O
the O
young O

accompanied O
her O
to O
the O

cheered O
that O

it O


drove O
off O

So O
Amelia B-PERSON
gave O
Dobbin B-PERSON
her O
little O
hand O
as O
she O
got O
out O

and O
rebuked O
him O
smilingly O

The O

that O

long O
after O
the O

Meanwhile O

so O
full O

that O
it O


served O

for O

even O
the O

As O

it O
was O
remarked O

At O


Chatham B-GPE
he O
followed O
the O

great O

He O
listened O


with O
the O

his O

officers O
( O
as O

called O

In O

This O

came O
very O


suddenly O

on O
the B-DATE

so O
alarmed O
Mr. O

Captain O

Jos B-PERSON
said O

, O
rated O
him O

laughed O
at O
him O


soundly O
: O
the O
mustachios O
were O
grown O

Jos B-PERSON

Dobbin B-PERSON

little O


Belgian B-NORP

by O
his O

behaviour O

and O
by O
invariably O
addressing O
Mr. O

as O
 O
My O
lord O
, O
 O
speedily O


acquired O
that O

altered O
at O

of O
the O

look O

They O
seem O
for O

dingy O

But O
it O
may O

that O
every O

The O
remembrance O

such O
a O
fact O
surely O


becomes O
a O
nation O
of O

It O
was O
a O
blessing O

the O

not O

the O

Bath B-ORG
, O
our O
friend O
, O
the O
Collector O

had O
lost O
a O


great O
deal O
of O
his O
pristine O
timidity O
, O
and O
was O
now O
, O
especially O
when O
fortified O


with O
liquor O
, O
as O
talkative O
as O
might O
be O
. O
He O
was O
rather O
a O
favourite O
with O
the O


regiment O

treating O
the O
young O
officers O
with O
sumptuosity O

amusing O

And O
as O
there O
is O
one O
well O

regiment O
of O
the O

travels O

a O
goat O
heading O

, O


George B-PERSON
said O
with O
respect O
to O
his O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
that O
his O
regiment O
marched O


with O
an O
elephant O

Since O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
introduction O
to O
the O
regiment O
, O
George B-PERSON
began O
to O
be O
rather O


ashamed O
of O
some O
of O
the O
company O
to O
which O
he O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
present O
her O
; O


and O
determined O
, O
as O
he O
told O
Dobbin B-PERSON
( O
with O
what O
satisfaction O
to O
the O
latter O
it O


need O
not O
be O
said O
, O
) O
to O
exchange O
into O
some O
better O
regiment O
soon O
, O
and O
to O
get O


his O
wife O
away O
from O
those O
damned O
vulgar O
women O
. O
But O
this O
vulgarity O
of O
being O


ashamed O
of O
one O
’s O
society O
is O
much O
more O
common O
among O
men O
than O
women O
( O
except O


very O
great O
ladies O
of O
fashion O
, O
who O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
indulge O
in O
it O
) O
; O
and O
Mrs. O


Amelia B-PERSON
, O
a O
natural O
and O
unaffected O
person O
, O
had O
none O
of O
that O
artificial O


shamefacedness O
which O
her O
husband O
mistook O
for O
delicacy O
on O
his O
own O
part O
. O
Thus O


Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
had O
a O
cock O
’s O
plume O
in O
her O
hat O
, O
and O
a O
very O
large O
 O
repayther B-WORK_OF_ART
 O
on O


her O
stomach O
, O
which O
she O
used O
to O
ring O
on O
all O
occasions O
, O
narrating O
how O
it O
had O


been O
presented O
to O
her O
by O
her O
fawther O
, O
as O
she O
stipt O
into O
the O
car’ge O
after O
her O


mar’ge O
; O
and O
these O
ornaments O
, O
with O
other O
outward O
peculiarities O
of O
the O
Major O
’s O


wife O
, O
gave O
excruciating O
agonies O
to O
Captain O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
when O
his O
wife O
and O
the O


Major B-PERSON

came O
in O

; O
whereas O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
only O
amused O
by O
the O
honest O
lady O

eccentricities O
, O
and O
not O
in O
the O

ashamed O
of O
her O
company O

As O

almost O
every O

carefully O

To O

This O

She O
redoubled O
in O

 O
How O
is O
dearest O
Amelia B-PERSON
? O
But O
I O
need O

ask O
: O
how O


pretty O
she O
looks O
! O
And O
who O
is O
that O
nice O
good O

natured O
looking O
creature O
with O


her O

a O

of O

O O
, O
you O
wicked O
man O
! O
And O
there O
is O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
eating O

, O


I O
declare O
: O
how O
he O
seems O
to O
enjoy O
it O
! O
General O
, O
why O
have O
we O
not O
had O
any O


ices O
? O
 O


 O
Shall O
I O
go O

you O
some O

 O
said O
the O

bursting O
with O
wrath O
. O


 O
Let O

me O

go O
, O
I O
entreat O
you O
, O
 O
George B-PERSON
said O

 O
No O
, O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON

Dear O
, O
sweet O
girl O
! O
Give O
me O
your O

Captain O


George B-PERSON
; O
 O
and O
so O
saying O
, O
and O
with O
a O
nod O
to O
the O
General O
, O
she O
tripped O
into O
the O


lobby O
. O
She O
gave O
George B-PERSON
the I-PERSON
queerest I-PERSON
knowingest B-ORG
look O
, O
when O
they O
were O


together O
, O
a O
look O
which O
might O
have O
been O
interpreted O
, O
 O
Do O
n’t O
you O
see O
the O
state O


of O
affairs O
, O
and O
what O
a O
fool O
I O
’m O
making O
of O
him O
? O
 O
But O
he O
did O
not O
perceive O
it O
. O


He O
was O
thinking O
of O
his O
own O
plans O
, O
and O
lost O
in O
pompous O
admiration O
of O
his O
own O


irresistible O
powers O
of O
pleasing O
. O


The O
curses O
to O
which O
the O
General O
gave O
a O
low O
utterance O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
Rebecca B-PERSON


and O
her O
conqueror O
had O
quitted O
him O
, O
were O
so O
deep O
, O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
no O


compositor O
would O
venture O
to O
print O
them O
were O
they O
written O
down O
. O
They O
came O


from O
the O
General O
’s O
heart O
; O
and O
a O
wonderful O
thing O
it O
is O
to O
think O
that O
the O


human O
heart O
is O
capable O
of O
generating O
such O
produce O
, O
and O
can O
throw O
out O

as O


occasion O

such O
a O

of O
lust O

fury O
, O
rage O
and O
hatred O

Amelia B-PERSON

gentle O
eyes O

too O
, O
had O
been O
fixed O
anxiously O
on O
the O

whose O


conduct O
had O
so O
chafed O
the O
jealous O
General O
; O
but O
when O
Rebecca B-PERSON
entered O
her O
box O
, O


she O
flew O
to O
her O

with O
an O
affectionate O
rapture O
which O
showed O
itself O
, O
in O


spite O
of O
the O
publicity O
of O

for O
she O
embraced O
her O

at O

in O

he O
had O

with O

 O
She O

All O

both O


Amelia B-PERSON

But O


beyond O
this O
neither O
of O

Amelia B-PERSON

overpowered O
by O
the O

the O

the O

Even O
the O


O’Dowd B-PERSON

silent O

after O

scarcely O

 O

 O
What O


the O

are O
you O

We O

I O

You O


do O

at O

 O


 O
But O
I O
do O

think O
he O
could O
pay O
if O
he O
lost O

 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
said O
; O
and O
his O
advice O


met O
with O
the O
success O
which O
advice O

Osborne B-PERSON
and O
Crawley B-PERSON
were O


repeatedly O
together O
now O
. O
General O
Tufto B-PERSON
dined O
abroad O
almost O
constantly O
. O


George B-PERSON
was O
always O
welcome O
in O
the O
apartments O
( O
very O
close O

those O
of O


the O

which O
the O
Aide O

camp O
and O
his O
wife O
occupied O
in O
the O
hotel O

Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
manners O
were O
such O
when O
she O
and O
George B-PERSON
visited O
Crawley B-GPE
and O
his O
wife O


at O
these B-DATE
quarters I-DATE
, O
that O
they O
had O
very O
nearly O
come O
to O
their O
first B-ORDINAL
quarrel O
; O


that O
is O
, O
George B-PERSON
scolded O
his O
wife O
violently O
for O
her O
evident O
unwillingness O
to O


go O
, O
and O
the O
high O
and O
mighty O
manner O
in O
which O
she O
comported O
herself O
towards O


Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
her O
old O
friend O
; O
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
did O
not O
say O
one B-CARDINAL
single O
word O
in O


reply O
; O
but O
with O
her O
husband O

eye O
upon O
her O
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
scanning O
her O
, O
as O
she O


felt O
, O
was O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
more O
bashful O
and O
awkward O
on O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
visit O
which O


she O
paid O
to O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
than O
on O
her O
first B-ORDINAL
call O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
doubly O
affectionate O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
would O
not O
take O
notice O
, O
in O


the O
least O
, O
of O
her O
friend O
’s O
coolness O
. O
 O
I O
think O
Emmy B-PERSON
has O
become O
prouder O
since O


her O
father O
’s O
name O
was O
in O
the O
— O
, O
since O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON

misfortunes O
, O
 O


Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
, O
softening O
the O
phrase O
charitably O
for O
George B-PERSON
’s O
ear O
. O


 O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
I O
thought O
when O
we O
were O
at O
Brighton B-GPE
she O
was O
doing O
me O
the O


honour O
to O
be O
jealous O
of O
me O
; O
and O
now O
I O
suppose O
she O
is O
scandalised O
because O


Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
, O
and O
the O
General O
live O
together O
. O
Why O
my O
dear O
creature O
, O
how O


could O
we O
, O
with O
our O
means O
, O
live O
at O
all O
, O
but O
for O
a O
friend O
to O
share O
expenses O
? O


And O
do O
you O
suppose O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
is O
not O
big O
enough O
to O
take O
care O
of O
my O
honour O
? O


But O
I O
’m O
very O
much O
obliged O
to O
Emmy B-PERSON

very O

 O
Mrs. O

 O
answered O
George B-PERSON
, O
 O
all O
women O
are O
jealous O

 O


 O
And O
all O
men O
too O

Were O

you O

the O
General O

you O

on O
the B-TIME

Why O

he O
was O
ready O

me O
for O
going O

you O

foolish O

Will O
you O

The O

They O


were O

Another O

was O
laughing O

He O
was O
not O
even O
angry O
with O

this O


good O

natured O
fellow O

It O
is O
a O
shame O

he O
owned O

but O
hang O
it O

if O
a O


pretty O

throw O
herself O

why O

what O
can O

do O

you O

I O

am O

rather O
free O
about O

otherwise O
for O
this O


prowess O

Next O
to O
conquering O

conquering O

pride O

out O
of O

amongst O

Don B-PERSON
Juan I-PERSON
be O
popular O

So O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
having O
a O
firm O
conviction O
in O
his O
own O
mind O
that O
he O
was O
a O


woman O
- O
killer O
and O
destined O
to O
conquer O
, O
did O
not O
run O
counter O
to O
his O
fate O
, O
but O


yielded O
himself O
up O
to O
it O
quite O
complacently O
. O
And O
as O
Emmy B-PERSON
did O
not O
say O
much O
or O


plague O
him O
with O
her O
jealousy O
, O
but O
merely O
became O
unhappy O
and O
pined O
over O
it O


miserably O
in O
secret O
, O
he O
chose O
to O
fancy O
that O
she O
was O
not O
suspicious O
of O
what O


all O
his O
acquaintance O
were O
perfectly O
aware O
— O
namely O
, O
that O
he O
was O
carrying O
on O
a O


desperate O
flirtation O
with O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
. O
He O
rode O
with O
her O
whenever O
she O
was O


free O
. O
He O
pretended O
regimental O
business O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
( O
by O
which O
falsehood O
she O
was O


not O
in O
the O
least O
deceived O
) O
, O
and O
consigning O
his O
wife O
to O
solitude O
or O
her O


brother O

society O
, O
passed O
his O
evenings O
in O
the O
Crawleys B-ORG
’ O
company O
; O
losing O


money O
to O
the O
husband O
and O
flattering O
himself O
that O
the O
wife O
was O
dying O
of O
love O


for O
him O
. O
It O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
this O
worthy O
couple O
never O
absolutely O


conspired O
and O
agreed O
together O
in O
so O
many O
words O
: O
the O
one O
to O
cajole O
the O
young O


gentleman O
, O
whilst O
the O
other O
won O
his O
money O
at O
cards O

but O
they O
understood O
each O


other O
perfectly O
well O
, O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
let O
Osborne B-PERSON
come O
and O
go O
with O
entire O
good O


humour O
. O


George B-PERSON
was O
so O
occupied O
with O
his O
new O
acquaintances O
that O
he O
and O
William B-PERSON


Dobbin B-PERSON
were O
by O
no O
means O
so O
much O
together O
as O
formerly O
. O
George B-PERSON
avoided O
him O
in O


public O
and O
in O
the O
regiment O
, O
and O
as O
we O
see O
, O
did O
not O
like O
those O
sermons O
which O


his O
senior O
was O
disposed O
to O
inflict O
upon O
him O
. O
If O
some O
parts O
of O
his O
conduct O


made O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
exceedingly O
grave O
and O
cool O
; O
of O
what O
use O
was O
it O
to O
tell O


George B-PERSON
that O
, O
though O
his O
whiskers O
were O
large O
, O
and O
his O
own O
opinion O
of O
his O


knowingness O
great O
, O
he O
was O
as O
green O
as O
a O
school O

boy O
? O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
making O
a O


victim O
of O
him O
as O
he O
had O
done O
of O
many O
before O

and O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
used O
him O


would O
fling O
him O
off O
with O
scorn O

He O
would O
not O
listen O
: O
and O
so O
, O
as O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
upon O


those B-DATE
days I-DATE
when O
he O
visited O
the O
Osborne B-PERSON
house O

seldom O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O


meeting O
his O
old O

much O
painful O

a O

on O
the B-DATE

in O

All O
Brussels B-GPE
had O


been O
in O
a O
state O
of O
excitement O
about O
it O
, O
and O
I O
have O
heard O
from O
ladies O
who O


were O
in O
that O
town O
at O
the O
period O
, O
that O
the O
talk O
and O
interest O
of O
persons O
of O


their O
own O
sex O
regarding O
the O
ball O
was O
much O
greater O
even O
than O
in O
respect O
of O


the O
enemy O
in O
their O
front O
. O
The O
struggles O
, O
intrigues O
, O
and O
prayers O
to O
get O


tickets O
were O
such O
as O

Jos B-PERSON

Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
, O
who O
were O
panting O
to O
be O
asked O
, O
strove O
in O
vain O
to O


procure O
tickets O
; O
but O
others O
of O
our O
friends O
were O
more O
lucky O
. O
For O
instance O
, O


through O
the O
interest O
of O
my O
Lord O
Bareacres B-PERSON
, O
and O
as O
a O
set O
- O
off O
for O
the O
dinner O


at O
the O
restaurateur O

, O
George B-PERSON
got O
a O
card O
for O
Captain O
and O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
; O
which O


circumstance O
greatly O
elated O
him O
. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
General O


commanding O
the O
division O
in O
which O
their O
regiment O
was O
, O
came O
laughing O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE


to O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
and O
displayed O
a O
similar O
invitation O
, O
which O
made O
Jos B-PERSON
envious O
, O


and O
George B-PERSON
wonder O
how O
the O
deuce O

he O

should O
be O
getting O
into O
society O
. O


Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
finally O
, O
were O
of O
course O
invited O
; O
as O
became O
the O
friends O


of O
a O
General O
commanding O
a O
cavalry O
brigade O
. O


On O
the O
appointed O
night O
, O
George B-PERSON
, O
having O
commanded O
new O
dresses O
and O
ornaments O


of O
all O
sorts O
for O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
drove O
to O
the O
famous O
ball O
, O
where O
his O
wife O
did O
not O


know O
a O
single O
soul O
. O
After O
looking O
about O
for O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres I-PERSON
, O
who O
cut O
him O
, O


thinking O
the O
card O
was O
quite O
enough O
— O
and O
after O
placing O
Amelia B-PERSON
on O
a O
bench O
he O


left O
her O
to O
her O
own O
cogitations O
there O
, O
thinking O
, O
on O
his O
own O
part O
, O
that O
he O


had O
behaved O
very O
handsomely O
in O
getting O
her O
new O
clothes O
, O
and O
bringing O
her O
to O


the O
ball O
, O
where O
she O
was O
free O
to O
amuse O
herself O
as O
she O
liked O
. O
Her O
thoughts O


were O
not O
of O
the O
pleasantest O
, O
and O
nobody O
except O
honest O
Dobbin B-PERSON
came O
to O
disturb O


them O
. O


Whilst O
her O
appearance O
was O
an O
utter O
failure O
( O
as O
her O
husband O
felt O
with O
a O
sort O


of O
rage O
, O
) O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
’s O

début O

was O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
very O


brilliant O
. O
She O
arrived O
very O
late O
. O
Her O
face O
was O
radiant O
; O
her O
dress O


perfection O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
great O
persons O
assembled O
, O
and O
the O
eye O
- O
glasses O


directed O
to O
her O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
seemed O
to O
be O
as O
cool O
and O
collected O
as O
when O
she O
used O


to O
marshal O
Miss B-PERSON
Pinkerton I-PERSON
’s O
little O
girls O
to O
church O
. O
Numbers O
of O
the O
men O
she O


knew O
already O
, O
and O
the O
dandies O
thronged O
round O
her O
. O
As O
for O
the O
ladies O
, O
it O
was O


whispered O
among O
them O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
run O
away O
with O
her O
from O
out O
of O
a O


convent O
, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
a O
relation O
of O
the O
Montmorency B-GPE
family O
. O
She O
spoke O


French B-LANGUAGE
so O
perfectly O
that O
there O
might O
be O
some O
truth O
in O
this O
report O
, O
and O
it O


was O
agreed O
that O
her O
manners O
were O
fine O
, O
and O
her O
air O

distingué B-GPE
. O

Fifty B-CARDINAL


would O
- O
be O
partners O
thronged O
round O
her O
at O
once O
, O
and O
pressed O
to O
have O
the O
honour O


to O
dance O
with O
her O
. O
But O
she O
said O
she O
was O
engaged O
, O
and O
only O
going O
to O
dance O


very O
little O
; O
and O
made O
her O
way O
at O
once O
to O
the O
place O
where O
Emmy B-PERSON
sat O
quite O


unnoticed O
, O
and O
dismally O
unhappy O
. O
And O
so O
, O
to O
finish O
the O
poor O
child O
at O
once O
, O


Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
ran O
and O
greeted O
affectionately O
her O
dearest O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
and O
began O


forthwith O
to O
patronise O
her O
. O
She O
found O
fault O
with O
her O
friend O
’s O
dress O
, O
and O
her O


hair O
- O
dresser O
, O
and O
wondered O
how O
she O
could O
be O
so O

chaussée O
, O

and O
vowed O


that O
she O
must O
send O
her O

corsetidère O

the B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O
She O
vowed O
that O


it O
was O
a O
delightful O
ball O
; O
that O
there O
was O
everybody O
that O
every O
one O
knew O
, O
and O


only O
a O

very O

few O
nobodies O
in O
the O
whole O
room O
. O
It O
is O
a O
fact O
, O
that O
in O
a O


fortnight O
, O
and O
after O
three B-CARDINAL
dinners O
in O
general O
society O
, O
this O
young O
woman O
had O


got O
up O
the O
genteel O
jargon O
so O
well O
, O
that O
a O
native O
could O
not O
speak O
it O
better O
; O


and O
it O
was O
only O
from O
her O
French B-NORP
being O
so O
good O
, O
that O
you O
could O
know O
she O
was O


not O
a O
born O
woman O
of O
fashion O
. O


George B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
left O
Emmy B-PERSON
on O
her O
bench O
on O
entering O
the O
ballroom O
, O
very O
soon O


found O
his O
way O
back O
when O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
by O
her O
dear O
friend O
’s O
side O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
was O


just O
lecturing O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
upon O
the O
follies O
which O
her O
husband O
was O


committing O
. O
 O
For O
God O
’s O
sake O
, O
stop O
him O
from O
gambling O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
 O
or O


he O
will O
ruin O
himself O
. O
He O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
are O
playing O
at O
cards O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
and O


you O
know O
he O
is O
very O
poor O
, O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
will O
win O
every O
shilling O
from O
him O
if O
he O


does O
not O
take O
care O
. O
Why O
do O
n’t O
you O
prevent O
him O
, O
you O
little O
careless O
creature O
? O


Why O
do O
n’t O
you O
come O
to O
us O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
instead O
of O
moping O
at O
home O
with O
that O


Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
. O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
is O

très O
aimable O
; O

how O
could O
one O
love O
a O


man O
with O
feet O
of O
such O
size O
? O
Your O
husband O
’s O
feet O
are O
darlings O
- O
Here O
he O
comes O
. O


Where O
have O
you O
been O
, O
wretch O
? O
Here O
is O
Emmy B-WORK_OF_ART
crying O
her O
eyes O
out O
for O
you O
. O
Are O


you O
coming O
to O
fetch O
me O
for O
the O
quadrille O
? O
 O
And O
she O
left O
her O
bouquet O
and O


shawl O
by O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
side O
, O
and O
tripped O
off O
with O
George B-PERSON
to O
dance O
. O
Women O
only O


know O
how O
to O
wound O
so O
. O
There O
is O
a O
poison O
on O
the O
tips O
of O
their O
little O
shafts O
, O


which O
stings O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
times O
more O
than O
a O
man O
’s O
blunter O
weapon O
. O
Our O
poor O


Emmy B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
never O
hated O
, O
never O
sneered O
all O
her O
life O
, O
was O
powerless O
in O
the O


hands O
of O
her O
remorseless O
little O
enemy O
. O


George O
danced O
with O
Rebecca B-PERSON
twice O
or O
thrice O
— O
how O
many O
times O
Amelia B-PERSON
scarcely O


knew O
. O
She O
sat O
quite O
unnoticed O
in O
her O
corner O
, O
except O
when O
Rawdon B-PERSON
came O
up O
with O


some O
words O
of O
clumsy O
conversation O
: O
and O
later B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
when O
Captain O


Dobbin B-PERSON
made O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
bring O
her O
refreshments O
and O
sit O
beside O
her O
. O
He O
did O


not O
like O
to O
ask O
her O
why O
she O
was O
so O
sad O
; O
but O
as O
a O
pretext O
for O
the O
tears O
which O


were O
filling O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
she O
told O
him O
that O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
alarmed O
her O
by O


telling O
her O
that O
George B-PERSON
would O
go O
on O
playing O
. O


 O
It O
is O
curious O
, O
when O
a O
man O
is O
bent O
upon O
play O
, O
by O
what O
clumsy O
rogues O
he O
will O


allow O
himself O
to O
be O
cheated O
, O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
said O
; O
and O
Emmy B-PERSON
said O
, O
 O
Indeed O
. O
 O
She O
was O


thinking O
of O
something O
else O
. O
It O
was O
not O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
money O
that O
grieved O


her O
. O


At O
last O
George O
came O
back O
for O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
shawl O
and O
flowers O
. O
She O
was O
going O


away O
. O
She O
did O
not O
even O
condescend O
to O
come O
back O
and O
say O
good O
- O
bye O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O


The O
poor O
girl O
let O
her O
husband O
come O
and O
go O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
and O
her O


head O
fell O
on O
her O
breast O
. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
been O
called O
away O
and O
was O
whispering O
deep O


in O
conversation O
with O
the O
General O
of O
the O
division O
, O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
had O
not O


seen O
this O
last O
parting O
. O
George B-PERSON
went O
away O
then O
with O
the O
bouquet O
; O
but O
when O
he O


gave O
it O
to O
the O
owner O
, O
there O
lay O
a O
note O
, O
coiled O
like O
a O
snake O
among O
the O


flowers O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
eye O
caught O
it O
at O
once O
. O
She O
had O
been O
used O
to O
deal O
with O


notes O
in O
early O
life O
. O
She O
put O
out O
her O
hand O
and O
took O
the O
nosegay O
. O
He O
saw O
by O


her O
eyes O
as O
they O
met O
, O
that O
she O
was O
aware O
what O
she O
should O
find O
there O
. O
Her O


husband O
hurried O
her O
away O
, O
still O
too O
intent O
upon O
his O
own O
thoughts O
, O
seemingly O
, O


to O
take O
note O
of O
any O
marks O
of O
recognition O
which O
might O
pass O
between O
his O
friend O


and O
his O
wife O
. O
These O
were O
, O
however O
, O
but O
trifling O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
gave O
George B-PERSON
her O


hand O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
usual O
quick O
knowing O
glances O
, O
and O
made O
a O
curtsey O
and O


walked O
away O
. O
George B-PERSON
bowed O
over O
the O
hand O
, O
said O
nothing O
in O
reply O
to O
a O
remark O


of O
Crawley B-GPE
’s O
, O
did O
not O
hear O
it O
even O
, O
his O
brain O
was O
so O
throbbing O
with O
triumph O


and O
excitement O
, O
and O
allowed O
them O
to O
go O
away O
without O
a O
word O
. O


His O
wife O
saw O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
part O
at O
least O
of O
the O
bouquet O
- O
scene O
. O
It O
was O
quite O


natural O
that O
George B-PERSON
should O
come O
at O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
request O
to O
get O
her O
her O
scarf O


and O
flowers O
: O
it O
was O
no O
more O
than O
he O
had O
done O
twenty B-CARDINAL
times O
before O
in O
the O


course O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
; O
but O
now O
it O
was O
too O
much O
for O
her O
. O
 O
William B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O


said O
, O
suddenly O
clinging O
to O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
near O
her O
, O
 O
you O
’ve O
always O
been O


very O
kind O
to O
me O
— O
I’m O
— O
I’m O
not O
well O
. O
Take O
me O
home O
. O
 O
She O
did O
not O
know O
she O
called O


him O
by O
his O
Christian B-NORP
name O
, O
as O
George B-PERSON
was O
accustomed O
to O
do O
. O
He O
went O
away O
with O


her O
quickly O
. O
Her O
lodgings O
were O
hard O
by O
; O
and O
they O
threaded O
through O
the O
crowd O


without O
, O
where O
everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
more O
astir O
than O
even O
in O
the O
ball O
- O
room O


within O
. O


George B-PERSON
had O
been O
angry O
twice O
or O
thrice O
at O
finding O
his O
wife O
up O
on O
his O
return O


from O
the O
parties O
which O
he O
frequented O
: O
so O
she O
went O
straight O
to O
bed O
now O
; O
but O


although O
she O
did O
not O
sleep O
, O
and O
although O
the O
din O
and O
clatter O
, O
and O
the O


galloping O
of O
horsemen O
were O
incessant O
, O
she O
never O
heard O
any O
of O
these O
noises O
, O


having O
quite O
other O
disturbances O
to O
keep O
her O
awake O
. O


Osborne B-PERSON
meanwhile O
, O
wild O
with O
elation O
, O
went O
off O
to O
a O
playtable O
, O
and O
began O
to O


bet O
frantically O
. O
He O
won O
repeatedly O
. O
 O
Everything O
succeeds O
with O
me O
to O
- O
night O
, O
 O


he O
said O
. O
But O
his O
luck O
at O
play O
even O
did O
not O
cure O
him O
of O
his O
restlessness O
, O
and O


he O
started O
up O
after O
awhile O
, O
pocketing O
his O
winnings O
, O
and O
went O
to O
a O
buffet O
, O


where O
he O
drank O
off O
many O
bumpers O
of O
wine O
. O


Here O
, O
as O
he O
was O
rattling O
away O
to O
the O
people O
around O
, O
laughing O
loudly O
and O


wild O
with O
spirits O
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
found O
him O
. O
He O
had O
been O
to O
the O
card O
- O
tables O
to O
look O


there O
for O
his O
friend O
. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
looked O
as O
pale O
and O
grave O
as O
his O
comrade O
was O


flushed O
and O
jovial O
. O


 O
Hullo B-ORG
, O
Dob O

Come O

he O
held O
out O
a O
trembling O
glass O
for O
the O
liquor O
. O


 O
Come O
out O

George B-PERSON
, O
 O

Dobbin B-PERSON
went O
up O
and O
whispered O
something O
to O
him O
, O
at O
which O
George B-PERSON
, O
giving O
a O


start O
and O
a O
wild O
hurray O
, O
tossed O
off O
his O
glass O
, O
clapped O
it O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O


walked O
away O
speedily O
on O
his O
friend O
’s O
arm O
. O
 O
The O
enemy O
has O
passed O
the O
Sambre O
, O
 O


William B-PERSON
said O
, O
 O
and O
our O
left O
is O
already O
engaged O
. O
Come O
away O
. O
We O
are O
to O
march O


in O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O
 O


Away O
went O
George B-PERSON
, O
his O
nerves O
quivering O
with O
excitement O
at O
the O
news O
so O
long O


looked O
for O
, O
so O
sudden O
when O
it O
came O
. O
What O
were O
love O
and O
intrigue O
now O
? O
He O


thought O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
things O
but O
these O
in O
his O
rapid O
walk O
to O
his O


quarters O
— O
his O
past O
life O
and O
future O
chances O
— O
the O
fate O
which O
might O
be O
before O


him O
— O
the O
wife O
, O
the O
child O
perhaps O
, O
from O
whom O
unseen O
he O
might O
be O
about O
to O
part O
. O


Oh O
, O
how O
he O
wished O
that O
night B-TIME
’s O
work O
undone O
! O
and O
that O
with O
a O
clear O
conscience O


at O
least O
he O
might O
say O
farewell O
to O
the O
tender O
and O
guileless O
being O
by O
whose O


love O
he O
had O
set O
such O
little O
store O
! O


He O
thought O
over O
his O
brief O
married O
life O
. O
In O
those B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
he O
had O


frightfully O
dissipated O
his O
little O
capital O
. O
How O
wild O
and O
reckless O
he O
had O


been O
! O
Should O
any O
mischance O
befall O
him O
: O
what O
was O
then O
left O
for O
her O
? O
How O


unworthy O
he O
was O
of O
her O
. O
Why O
had O
he O
married O
her O
? O
He O
was O
not O
fit O
for O
marriage O
. O


Why O
had O
he O
disobeyed O
his O
father O
, O
who O
had O
been O
always O
so O
generous O
to O
him O
? O


Hope O
, O
remorse O
, O
ambition O
, O
tenderness O
, O
and O
selfish O
regret O
filled O
his O
heart O
. O


He O
sat O
down O
and O
wrote O
to O
his O
father O
, O
remembering O
what O
he O
had O
said O
once O


before O
, O
when O
he O
was O
engaged O
to O
fight O
a O
duel O
. O
Dawn O
faintly O
streaked O
the O
sky O


as O
he O
closed O
this O
farewell O
letter O
. O
He O
sealed O
it O
, O
and O
kissed O
the O


superscription O
. O
He O
thought O
how O
he O
had O
deserted O
that O
generous O
father O
, O
and O
of O


the O
thousand O
kindnesses O
which O
the O
stern O
old O
man O
had O
done O
him O
. O


He O
had O
looked O
into O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
bed O
- O
room O
when O
he O
entered O
; O
she O
lay O
quiet O
, O
and O


her O
eyes O
seemed O
closed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
glad O
that O
she O
was O
asleep O
. O
On O
arriving O
at O


his O
quarters O
from O
the O
ball O
, O
he O
had O
found O
his O
regimental O
servant O
already O


making O
preparations O
for O
his O
departure O
: O
the O
man O
had O
understood O
his O
signal O
to O


be O
still O
, O
and O
these O
arrangements O
were O
very O
quickly O
and O
silently O
made O
. O
Should O


he O
go O
in O
and O
wake O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
he O
thought O
, O
or O
leave O
a O
note O
for O
her O
brother O
to O


break O
the O
news O
of O
departure O
to O
her O
? O
He O
went O
in O
to O
look O
at O
her O
once O


again O
. O


She O
had O
been O
awake O
when O
he O
first B-ORDINAL
entered O
her O
room O
, O
but O
had O
kept O
her O
eyes O


closed O
, O
so O
that O
even O
her O
wakefulness O
should O
not O
seem O
to O
reproach O
him O
. O
But O


when O
he O
had O
returned O
, O
so O
soon O
after O
herself O
, O
too O
, O
this O
timid O
little O
heart O


had O
felt O
more O
at O
ease O
, O
and O
turning O
towards O
him O
as O
he O
stepped O
softly O
out O
of O


the O
room O
, O
she O
had O
fallen O
into O
a O
light O
sleep O
. O
George B-PERSON
came O
in O
and O
looked O
at O


her O
again O
, O
entering O
still O
more O
softly O
. O
By O
the O
pale O
night O
- O
lamp O
he O
could O
see O


her O
sweet O
, O
pale O
face O
— O
the O
purple O
eyelids O
were O
fringed O
and O
closed O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL


round O
arm O
, O
smooth O
and O
white O
, O
lay O
outside O
of O
the O
coverlet O

Good O
God O

how O
pure O


she O
was O
; O
how O
gentle O
, O
how O
tender O
, O
and O
how O
friendless O
! O
and O
he O
, O
how O
selfish O

brutal O
, O
and O
black O
with O
crime O
! O
Heart O
- O
stained O
, O
and O
shame O
- O
stricken O
, O
he O
stood O
at O


the O
bed O
’s O
foot O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
sleeping O
girl O
. O
How O
dared O
he O
— O
who O
was O
he O
, O
to O


pray O
for O
one O
so O
spotless O
! O
God B-PERSON
bless O
her O
! O
God B-PERSON

He O
came O
to O
the O


bed O

and O
looked O
at O
the O
hand O
, O
the O
little O
soft O
hand O
, O
lying O
asleep O
; O
and O
he O


bent O
over O
the O

noiselessly O
towards O
the O
gentle O
pale O
face O

Two B-CARDINAL
fair O

She O
was O
awake O

At O

a O

 O
that O
there O

for O

, O
the O
good O

, O
arrayed O
in O
curl O

felt O
that O
her O
duty O
was O
to O
act O
, O
and O
not O
to O
sleep O
, O
at O
this O
juncture O
. O
 O
Time O


enough O
for O
that O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
 O
when O
Mick B-PERSON

gone O
; O
 O
and O
so O
she O
packed O
his O


travelling O
valise O
ready O
for O
the O
march O
, O
brushed O
his O
cloak O
, O
his O
cap O
, O
and O
other O


warlike O
habiliments O
, O
set O
them O
out O
in O

stowed O
away O
in O
the O


cloak O

a O

a O

a O
pint O
of O
a O
remarkably O
sound O
Cognac B-ORG


brandy O
, O
of O
which O
she O
and O
the O
Major O
approved O
very O
much O
; O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O


hands O
of O
the O
 O
repayther O
 O
pointed O
to O
half B-DATE
- I-DATE
past I-DATE
one I-DATE
, O
and O
its O
interior O


arrangements O
( O
it O
had O
a O
tone O
quite O
equal O
to O
a O
cathaydral O
, O
its O
fair O
owner O


considered O
) O
knelled O
forth O
that O
fatal O
hour O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
woke O
up O
her O
Major O
, O


and O
had O
as O
comfortable O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
prepared O
for O
him O
as O
any O
made O
that O


morning B-TIME
in O
Brussels B-GPE
. O
And O
who O
is O
there O
will O
deny O
that O
this O
worthy O
lady O
’s O


preparations O
betokened O
affection O
as O
much O
as O
the O
fits O
of O
tears O
and O
hysterics O


by O
which O
more O
sensitive O
females O
exhibited O
their O
love O
, O
and O
that O
their O


partaking O
of O
this O
coffee O
, O
which O
they O
drank O
together O
while O
the O
bugles O
were O


sounding O
the O
turn O
- O
out O
and O
the O
drums O
beating O
in O
the B-DATE
various I-DATE
quarters I-DATE
of O
the O


town O
, O
was O
not O
more O
useful O
and O
to O
the O
purpose O
than O
the O
outpouring O
of O
nay O
mere O


sentiment O
could O
be O
? O
The O
consequence O
was O
, O
that O
the O
Major O
appeared O
on O
parade O


quite O
trim O
, O
fresh O
, O
and O
alert O
— O
his O
well O
- O
shaved O
rosy O
countenance O
, O
as O
he O
sat O
on O


horseback O
, O
giving O
cheerfulness O
and O
confidence O
to O
the O
whole O
corps O
. O
All O
the O


officers O
saluted O
her O
when O
the O
regiment O
marched O
by O
the O
balcony O
on O
which O
this O


brave O
woman O
stood O
, O
and O
waved O
them O
a O
cheer O
as O
they O
passed O
; O
and O
I O
daresay O
it O


was O
not O
from O
want O
of O
courage O
, O
but O
from O
a O
sense O
of O
female O
delicacy O
and O


propriety O
, O
that O
she O
refrained O
from O
leading O
the O
gallant O
— O
th O
personally O
into O


action O
. O


On O
Sundays B-DATE
, O
and O
at O
periods O
of O
a O
solemn O
nature O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
used O
to O
read O


with O
great O
gravity O
out O
of O
a O
large O
volume O
of O
her O
uncle O
the O
Dean B-PERSON
’s O
sermons O
. O
It O


had O
been O
of O
great O
comfort O
to O
her O
on O
board O
the O
transport O
as O
they O
were O
coming O


home O
, O
and O
were O
very O
nearly O
wrecked O
, O
on O
their O
return O
from O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE
Indies I-GPE
. O


After O
the O
regiment O
’s O
departure O
she O
betook O
herself O
to O
this O
volume O
for O


meditation O
; O
perhaps O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
much O
of O
what O
she O
was O
reading O
, O
and O


her O
thoughts O
were O
elsewhere O
: O
but O
the O
sleep O
project O
, O
with O
poor O
Mick B-PERSON
’s O


nightcap O
there O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
was O
quite O
a O
vain O
one O
. O
So O
it O
is O
in O
the O
world O
. O

how O

Mrs. O

wisely O
determined O
to O

way O

no O

sorrow O

and O
bore O
the O
parting O
from O

with O
quite O
a O
Spartan B-NORP
equanimity O

Indeed O
Captain O
Rawdon B-PERSON

was O
much O

affected O
at O
the O

taking O

the O
resolute O
little O

to O
whom O
he O
bade O


farewell O

She O
had O
mastered O
this O
rude O

nature O
; O
and O
he O
loved O

worshipped O
her O
with O
all O
his O
faculties O
of O
regard O

admiration O

In O
all O
his O

he O
had O
never O

so O
happy O

during O
the B-DATE

the O

were O
quite O
insipid O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
lawful O
matrimonial O
pleasures O
which O


of O
late O
he O
had O
enjoyed O
. O
She O
had O
known O
perpetually O
how O
to O
divert O
him O
; O
and O
he O


had O
found O
his O
house O
and O
her O
society O
a O
thousand O
times O
more O
pleasant O
than O
any O


place O
or O
company O
which O
he O
had O
ever O
frequented O
from O
his O
childhood O
until O
now O
. O


And O
he O
cursed O
his O
past O
follies O
and O
extravagances O
, O
and O
bemoaned O
his O
vast O


outlying O
debts O
above O
all O

which O
must O
remain O
forever O
as O
obstacles O
to O
prevent O


his O
wife O

in O
the O

. O
He O
had O
often O
groaned O
over O

He O
himself O
was O
struck O
with O
this O

 O
Hang O


it O

 O
he O
would O

( O

use O
a O
still O
stronger O
expression O
out O
of O
his O


simple O
vocabulary O

, O
 O
before O

 O


Rebecca B-PERSON
always O
knew O
how O
to O
conjure O
away O
these O
moods O
of O
melancholy O

 O
Why O
, O
my O


stupid O

, O
 O

your O

I O
have O
another O

The O

has O
always O


belonged O
to O
the O

and O
why O
should O
n’t O
you O
sell O
out O
and O
go O
into O


the O
Church B-ORG
? O
 O
The O
idea O
of O
this O
conversion O
set O
Rawdon B-PERSON
into O
roars O
of O
laughter O
: O


you O
might O
have O
heard O
the O
explosion O
through O
the O
hotel O
at O
midnight B-TIME
, O
and O
the O


haw O
- O
haws O
of O
the O
great O
dragoon O
’s O
voice O
. O
General O
Tufto B-PERSON
heard O
him O
from O
his O


quarters O
on O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
floor O
above O
them O
; O
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
acted O
the O
scene O
with O


great O
spirit O
, O
and O
preached O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
first B-ORDINAL
sermon O
, O
to O
the O
immense O
delight O
of O


the O
General O
at O
breakfast O
. O


But O
these O
were O
mere O
by O
- O
gone O
days O
and O
talk O
. O
When O
the O
final O
news O
arrived O
that O


the O
campaign O
was O
opened O
, O
and O
the O
troops O
were O
to O
march O
, O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
gravity O


became O
such O
that O
Becky B-PERSON
rallied O
him O
about O
it O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
rather O
hurt O


the O
feelings O
of O
the O
Guardsman O
. O
 O
You O
do O
n’t O
suppose O
I O
’m O
afraid O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
I O


should O
think O
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
tremor O
in O
his O
voice O
. O
 O
But O
I O
’m O
a O
pretty O
good O


mark O
for O
a O
shot O
, O
and O
you O
see O
if O
it O
brings O
me O
down O
, O
why O
I O
leave O
one O
and O


perhaps O
two B-CARDINAL
behind O
me O
whom O
I O
should O
wish O
to O
provide O
for O
, O
as O
I O
brought O
’em O


into O

It O
is O
no O

 O


Rebecca B-PERSON
by O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
caresses O
and O
kind O
words O
tried O
to O
soothe O
the O
feelings O


of O
the O
wounded O
lover O
. O
It O
was O
only O
when O
her O
vivacity O
and O
sense O
of O
humour O
got O


the O
better O
of O
this O
sprightly O
creature O
( O
as O
they O
would O
do O
under O
most O


circumstances O
of O
life O
indeed O
) O
that O
she O
would O
break O
out O
with O
her O
satire O
, O
but O


she O
could O
soon O
put O
on O
a O
demure O
face O

 O
Dearest B-WORK_OF_ART

, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
 O

you O


suppose O
I O
feel O
nothing O

 O
and O
hastily O
dashing O
something O
from O
her O

she O


looked O
up O
in O
her O

 O
Look O

And O
this O

went O
off O
on O
his O
campaign O
with O
a O

as O
modest O
as O
that O


of O
a O
sergeant O

and O
with O
something O
like O
a O
prayer O
on O
his O
lips O
for O
the O
woman O
he O


was O
leaving O
. O
He O
took O
her O
up O
form O
the O
ground O

and O
held O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
for O
a B-TIME


minute I-TIME
, O
tight O
pressed O
against O
his O
strong O
- O
beating O
heart O
. O
His O
face O
was O
purple O


and O
his O
eyes O
dim O
, O
as O
he O
put O
her O
down O
and O
left O
her O
. O
He O
rode O
by O
his O
General O
’s O


side O
, O
and O
smoked O
his O
cigar O
in O
silence O
as O
they O
hastened O
after O
the O
troops O
of O


the O
General O
’s O
brigade O
, O
which O
preceded O
them O
; O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
they O
were O


some O
miles O
on O
their O
way O
that O
he O
left O
off O
twirling O
his O
moustache O
and O
broke O


silence O
. O


And O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
as O
we O
have O
said O
, O
wisely O
determined O
not O
to O
give O
way O
to O


unavailing O
sentimentality O
on O
her O
husband O
’s O
departure O
. O
She O
waved O
him O
an O
adieu O


from O
the O
window O
, O
and O
stood O
there O
for O
a O
moment O
looking O
out O
after O
he O
was O
gone O
. O


The O
cathedral O
towers O
and O
the O
full O
gables O
of O
the O
quaint O
old O
houses O
were O
just O


beginning O
to O
blush O
in O
the O
sunrise O
. O
There O
had O
been O
no O
rest O
for O
her O
that O


night O
. O
She O
was O
still O
in O
her O
pretty O
ball O
- O
dress O
, O
her O
fair O
hair O
hanging O


somewhat O
out O
of O
curl O
on O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
circles O
round O
her O
eyes O
dark O
with O


watching O
. O
 O
What O
a O
fright O
I O
seem O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
examining O
herself O
in O
the O
glass O
, O


 O
and O
how O
pale O
this O
pink O
makes O
one B-CARDINAL
look O
! O
 O
So O
she O
divested O
herself O
of O
this O


pink O
raiment O
; O
in O
doing O
which O
a O
note O
fell O
out O
from O
her O
corsage O
, O
which O
she O


picked O
up O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
and O
locked O
into O
her O
dressing O
- O
box O
. O
And O
then O
she O
put O


her O
bouquet O
of O
the O
ball O
into O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
slept O


very O
comfortably O
. O


The O
town O
was O
quite O
quiet O
when O
she O
woke O
up O
at O
ten B-TIME
o’clock I-TIME
, O
and O
partook O
of O


coffee O
, O
very O
requisite O
and O
comforting O
after O
the O
exhaustion O
and O
grief O
of O
the O


morning B-TIME
’s O
occurrences O
. O


This O
meal O
over O
, O
she O
resumed O
honest O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
calculations O
of O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME


previous O
, O
and O
surveyed O
her O
position O
. O
Should O
the O
worst O
befall O
, O
all O
things O


considered O
, O
she O
was O
pretty O
well O
to O
do O
. O
There O
were O
her O
own O
trinkets O
and O


trousseau O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
those O
which O
her O

Rawdon B-PERSON

Besides O
these O

the O

the O

No O

the O
British B-NORP

not O
the O

, O
could O
be O
more O
cool O

collected O
in O
the O

than O
the O

And O
there O
was O
another O

a O

This O

was O
broken O

by O
the O

of O

in O

Being O
a O
great O
sleeper O
, O
and O
fond O
of O
his O
bed O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
he O
would O


have O
snoozed O
on O
until O
his B-TIME
usual I-TIME

in O
the O
forenoon O
, O
in O

of O


all O
the O

in O
the O

, O
but O
for O
an O


interruption O

which O
did O
not O
come O
from O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
, O
who O
shared O
Jos B-PERSON

quarters O

him O
, O
and O
was O
as O

too O
much O
with O
his O
own O

or O
with O
grief O
at O
parting O

was O
not O
George B-PERSON

, O
who O
interposed O
between O


Jos B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON

sleep O

but O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
who O
came O
and O
roused O
him O
up O
, O


insisting O
on O

with O
him O
before O

departure O
. O


 O
Very O
kind O
of O
you O
, O
 O
said O
Jos B-PERSON

yawning O
, O
and O
wishing O
the O
Captain O
at O
the O


deuce O

 O
I O
— O
I O
did O

like O
to O
go O
off O
without O
saying O
good O
- O
bye O
, O
you O
know O
, O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
said O


in O
a O
very O
incoherent O
manner O
; O
 O
because O
you O
know O
some O
of O
us O
may O
n’t O
come O
back O


again O
, O
and O
I O
like O
to O
see O
you O
all O
well O
, O
and O
— O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
, O
you O


know O
. O
 O


 O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
 O
Jos B-PERSON
asked O
, O
rubbing O
his O
eyes O
. O
The O
Captain O
did O
not O
in O
the O


least O
hear O
him O
or O
look O
at O
the O
stout O
gentleman O
in O
the O
nightcap O
, O
about O
whom O
he O


professed O
to O
have O
such O
a O
tender O
interest O
. O
The O
hypocrite O
was O
looking O
and O


listening O
with O
all O
his O
might O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
George B-PERSON
’s O
apartments O
, O


striding O
about O
the O
room O
, O
upsetting O
the O
chairs O
, O
beating O
the O
tattoo O
, O
biting O


his O
nails O
, O
and O
showing O
other O
signs O
of O
great O
inward O
emotion O
. O


Jos B-PERSON
had O
always O
had O
rather O
a O
mean O
opinion O
of O
the O
Captain O
, O
and O
now O
began O
to O


think O
his O
courage O
was O
somewhat O
equivocal O
. O
 O
What O
is O
it O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you O
, O


Dobbin B-PERSON
? O
 O
he O
said O
, O
in O
a O
sarcastic O
tone O
. O
] O


 O
I O
tell O
you O
what O
you O
can O
do O
, O
 O
the O
Captain O
replied O
, O
coming O
up O
to O
the O
bed O
; O


 O
we O
march O
in O
a B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
of I-DATE
an I-DATE
hour I-DATE
, O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
and O
neither O
George B-PERSON
nor O
I O
may O
ever O


come O
back O
. O
Mind O
you O
, O
you O
are O
not O
to O
stir O
from O
this O
town O
until O
you O
ascertain O


how O
things O
go O
. O
You O
are O
to O
stay O
here O
and O
watch O
over O
your O
sister O
, O
and O
comfort O


her O
, O
and O
see O
that O
no O
harm O
comes O
to O
her O
. O
If O
anything O
happens O
to O
George B-PERSON
, O


remember O
she O
has O
no O
one O
but O
you O
in O
the O
world O
to O
look O
to O
. O
If O
it O
goes O
wrong O


with O
the O
army O
, O
you O
’ll O
see O
her O
safe O
back O
to O
England B-GPE
; O
and O
you O
will O
promise O
me O


on O
your O
word O
that O
you O
will O
never O
desert O
her O
. O
I O
know O
you O
wo O
n’t O
: O
as O
far O
as O


money O
goes O
, O
you O
were O
always O
free O
enough O
with O
that O
. O
Do O
you O
want O
any O
? O
I O
mean O
, O


have O
you O
enough O
gold O
to O
take O
you O
back O
to O
England B-GPE
in O
case O
of O
a O


misfortune O
? O
 O


 O
Sir O
, O
 O
said O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
majestically O
, O
 O
when O
I O
want O
money O
, O
I O
know O
where O
to O
ask O
for O


it O
. O
And O
as O
for O
my O
sister O
, O

you O

need O
n’t O
tell O
me O
how O
I O
ought O
to O
behave O


to O
her O
. O
 O


 O
You O
speak O
like O
a O
man O
of O
spirit O
, O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
 O
the O
other O
answered O
good O
- O
naturedly O
, O


 O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
that O
George B-PERSON
can O
leave O
her O
in O
such O
good O
hands O
. O
So O
I O
may O
give O


him O
your O
word O
of O
honour O
, O
may O
I O
, O
that O
in O
case O
of O
extremity O
you O
will O
stand O
by O


her O
? O
 O


 O
Of O
course O
, O
of O
course O
, O
 O
answered O
Mr. O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
whose O
generosity O
in O
money O
matters O


Dobbin B-PERSON
estimated O
quite O
correctly O
. O


 O
And O
you O
’ll O
see O
her O
safe O
out O
of O
Brussels B-GPE
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
defeat O
? O
 O


 O
A O

D O
— O
it O
, O
sir O
, O
it O
’s O
impossible O
. O
Do O
n’t O
try O
and O
frighten O


me O
, O
 O

the O
hero O
cried O
from O
his O
bed O
; O
and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
mind O
was O
thus O


perfectly O
set O
at O
ease O
now O
that O
Jos B-PERSON
had O
spoken O
out O
so O
resolutely O
respecting O


his O
conduct O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
 O
At O
least O
, O
 O
thought O
the O
Captain O
, O
 O
there O
will O
be O
a O


retreat O
secured O
for O
her O
in O
case O
the O
worst O
should O
ensue O
. O
 O


If O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
expected O
to O
get O
any O
personal O
comfort O
and O
satisfaction O


from O
having O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
view O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
before O
the O
regiment O
marched O
away O
, O
his O


selfishness O
was O
punished O
just O
as O
such O
odious O
egotism O
deserved O
to O
be O
. O
The O


door O
of O
Jos B-PERSON
’s O
bed O
- O
room O
opened O
into O
the O
sitting O
- O
room O
which O
was O
common O
to O
the O


family O
party O
, O
and O
opposite O
this O
door O
was O
that O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
chamber O
. O
The O


bugles O
had O
wakened O
everybody O
: O
there O
was O
no O
use O
in O
concealment O
now O
. O
George B-PERSON
’s O


servant O
was O
packing O
in O
this O
room O
: O
Osborne B-PERSON
coming O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O


contiguous O
bed O
- O
room O
, O
flinging O
to O
the O
man O
such O
articles O
as O
he O
thought O
fit O
to O


carry O
on O
the O
campaign O
. O
And O
presently O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
the O
opportunity O
which O
his O


heart O
coveted O
, O
and O
he O
got O
sight O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
face O
once O
more O
. O
But O
what O
a O
face O


it O
was O
! O
So O
white O
, O
so O
wild O
and O
despair O
stricken O
, O
that O
the O
remembrance O
of O
it O


haunted O
him O
afterwards O
like O
a O
crime O
, O
and O
the O
sight O
smote O
him O
with O


inexpressible O
pangs O
of O
longing O
and O
pity O
. O


She O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a B-TIME
white I-TIME
morning I-TIME
dress O
, O
her O
hair O
falling O
on O
her O


shoulders O
, O
and O
her O
large O
eyes O
fixed O
and O
without O
light O
. O
By O
way O
of O
helping O
on O


the O
preparations O
for O
the O
departure O
, O
and O
showing O
that O
she O
too O
could O
be O
useful O


at O
a O
moment O
so O
critical O
, O
this O
poor O
soul O
had O
taken O
up O
a O
sash O
of O
George B-PERSON
’s O
from O


the O
drawers O
whereon O
it O
lay O
, O
and O
followed O
him O
to O
and O
fro O
with O
the O
sash O
in O
her O


hand O
, O
looking O
on O
mutely O
as O
his O
packing O
proceeded O
. O
She O
came O
out O
and O
stood O
, O


leaning O
at O
the O
wall O
, O
holding O
this O
sash O
against O
her O
bosom O
, O
from O
which O
the O


heavy O
net O
of O
crimson O
dropped O
like O
a O
large O
stain O
of O
blood O
. O
Our O
gentle O
- O
hearted O


Captain O
felt O
a O
guilty O
shock O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
. O
 O
Good O
God O
, O
 O
thought O
he O
, O


 O
and O
is O
it O
grief O
like O
this O
I O
dared O
to O
pry O
into O
? O
 O
And O
there O
was O
no O
help O
: O
no O


means O
to O
soothe O
and O
comfort O
this O
helpless O
, O
speechless O
misery O
. O
He O
stood O
for O
a O


moment O
and O
looked O
at O
her O
, O
powerless O
and O
torn O
with O
pity O
, O
as O
a O
parent O
regards O


an O
infant O
in O
pain O
. O


At O
last O
, O
George B-PERSON
took O
Emmy B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
, O
and O
led O
her O
back O
into O
the O
bed O
- O
room O
, O
from O


whence O
he O
came O
out O
alone O
. O
The O
parting O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
that O
moment O
, O
and O
he O


was O
gone O
. O


 O
Thank O
Heaven O
that O
is O
over O

 O
George B-PERSON
thought O
, O
bounding O
down O
the O
stair O
, O
his O


sword O
under O
his O
arm O
, O
as O
he O
ran O
swiftly O
to O
the O
alarm O
ground O
, O
where O
the O


regiment O
was O
mustered O
, O
and O
whither O
trooped O
men O
and O
officers O
hurrying O
from O


their O
billets O
; O
his O
pulse O
was O
throbbing O
and O
his O
cheeks O
flushed O
: O
the O
great O


game O
of O
war O
was O
going O
to O
be O
played O
, O
and O
he O
one O
of O
the O
players O
. O
What O
a O
fierce O


excitement O
of O
doubt O
, O
hope O
, O
and O
pleasure O
! O
What O
tremendous O
hazards O
of O
loss O
or O


gain O
! O
What O
were O
all O
the O
games O
of O
chance O
he O
had O
ever O
played O
compared O
to O
this O


one O

Into O
all O
contests O
requiring O
athletic O
skill O
and O
courage O
, O
the O
young O
man O
, O


from O
his O
boyhood O
upwards O
, O
had O
flung O
himself O
with O
all O
his O
might O
. O
The O
champion O


of O
his O
school O
and O
his O
regiment O
, O
the O
bravos O
of O
his O
companions O

followed O


him O
everywhere O
; O
from O
the O
boy O

cricket O

match O
to O
the O

won O
a B-CARDINAL

; O
and O
wherever O
he O
went O

women O

What O

out O

at O
the O

George B-PERSON
jumped O

, O
that O

About O
George B-PERSON
’s O
absence O
, O
his O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
very O
easy O
in O
mind O
. O
Perhaps O


Jos B-PERSON
was O
rather O
pleased O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
Osborne B-PERSON
was O
gone O
, O
for O
during O


George B-PERSON
’s O
presence O
, O
the O
other O
had O
played O
but O
a O
very O
secondary O
part O
in O
the O


household O
, O
and O
Osborne B-PERSON
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
show O
his O
contempt O
of O
the O
stout O


civilian O
. O
But O
Emmy B-PERSON
had O
always O
been O
good O
and O
attentive O
to O
him O
. O
It O
was O
she O
who O


ministered O
to O
his O
comforts O
, O
who O
superintended O
the O
dishes O
that O
he O
liked O
, O
who O


walked O
or O
rode O
with O
him O
( O
as O
she O
had O
many O
, O
too O
many O
, O
opportunities O
of O
doing O
, O


for O
where O
was O
George B-PERSON
? O
) O
and O
who O
interposed O
her O
sweet O
face O
between O
his O
anger O


and O
her O
husband O
’s O
scorn O
. O
Many O
timid O
remonstrances O
had O
she O
uttered O
to O
George B-PERSON


in O
behalf O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
but O
the O
former O
in O
his O
trenchant O
way O
cut O
these O


entreaties O
short O
. O
 O
I O
’m O
an O
honest O
man,he O
said O
, O
 O
and O
if O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
I O


show O
it O
, O
as O
an O
honest O
man O
will O
. O
How O
the O
deuce O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
would O
you O
have O
me O


behave O
respectfully O
to O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
your O
brother O
? O
 O
So O
Jos B-PERSON
was O
pleased O
with O


George B-PERSON
’s O
absence O
. O
His O
plain O
hat O
, O
and O
gloves O
on O
a O
sideboard O
, O
and O
the O
idea O


that O
the O
owner O
was O
away O
, O
caused O
Jos B-PERSON
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
secret O
thrill O
of O


pleasure O
. O

 O
He O

wo O
n’t O
be O
troubling O
me O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
 O
Jos O
thought O
, O


 O
with O
his O
dandified O
airs O
and O
his O
impudence O
. O
 O


 O
Put B-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Captain I-WORK_OF_ART
’s I-WORK_OF_ART
hat O
into O
the O
ante O
- O
room O
, O
 O
he O
said O
to O
Isidor B-ORG
, O
the O


servant O
. O


 O
Perhaps O
he O
wo O
n’t O
want O
it O
again O
, O
 O
replied O
the O
lackey O
, O
looking O
knowingly O
at O


his O
master O
. O
He O
hated O
George B-PERSON
too O
, O
whose O
insolence O
towards O
him O
was O
quite O
of O


the O
English B-LANGUAGE
sort O
. O


 O
And O
ask O
if O
Madame O
is O
coming O
to O
breakfast O
, O
 O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
said O
with O
great O


majesty O
, O
ashamed O
to O
enter O
with O
a O
servant O
upon O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
dislike O
for O


George B-PERSON
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
he O
had O
abused O
his O
brother O
to O
the O
valet O
a O
score O
of O


times O
before O
. O


Alas O
! O
Madame O
could O
not O
come O
to O
breakfast O
, O
and O
cut O
the O

tartines O


that O
Mr. O
Jos B-PERSON
liked O
. O
Madame O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
ill O
, O
and O
had O
been O
in O
a O


frightful O
state O
ever O
since O
her O
husband O
’s O
departure O
, O
so O
her O

bonne O


said O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
showed O
his O
sympathy O
, O
by O
pouring O
her O
out O
a O
large O
cup O
of O
tea O
. O
It O
was O


his O
way O
of O
exhibiting O
kindness O
: O
and O
he O
improved O
on O
this O
; O
he O
not O
only O
sent O


her O
breakfast O
, O
but O
he O
bethought O
him O
what O
delicacies O
she O
would O
most O
like O
for O


dinner O
. O


Isidor B-PERSON
, O
the O
valet O
, O
had O
looked O
on O
very O
sulkily O
, O
while O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
servant O
was O


disposing O
of O
his O
master O
’s O
baggage O
previous O
to O
the O
Captain O
’s O
departure O
: O
for O


in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
he O
hated O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
whose O
conduct O
to O
him O
, O
and O
to O
all O


inferiors O
, O
was O
generally O
overbearing O
, O
( O
nor O
does O
the O
continental O
domestic O


like O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
insolence O
as O
our O
own O
better O

tempered O
servants O
do O
:) O


and O
secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
he O
was O
angry O
that O
so O
many O
valuables O
should O
be O
removed O
from O


under O
his O
hands O
, O
to O
fall O
into O
other O
people O

possession O
when O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE


discomfiture O
should O
arrive O
. O
Of O
this O
defeat O
he O
and O
a O
vast O
number O
of O
other O


persons O
in O
Brussels B-GPE
and O
Belgium B-GPE
did O
not O
make O
the O
slightest O
doubt O
. O
The O
almost O


universal O
belief O
was O
, O
that O
the O
Emperor O
would O
divide O
the O
Prussian B-NORP
and O
English B-LANGUAGE


armies O
, O
annihilate O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
and O
march O
into O
Brussels B-GPE
before O
three B-DATE


days I-DATE

when O
all O

his O

who O
would O
be O


killed O
, O
or O
fugitives O

prisoners O
, O
would O
lawfully O
become O
the O
property O
of O


Monsieur O
Isidor B-PERSON
. O


As O
he O
helped O
Jos B-PERSON
through O
his O
toilsome O
and O
complicated O
daily B-DATE
toilette O
, O
this O


faithful O
servant O
would O
calculate O
what O
he O
should O
do O
with O
the O
very O
articles O


with O
which O
he O
was O
decorating O
his O
master O

He O
would O
make O
a O
present O
of O


the O
silver O
essence O

bottles O
and O
toilet O
knicknacks O
to O
a O
young O

he O


was O
fond O
; O
and O
keep O
the O
English B-NORP

and O
the O
large O
ruby O

for O
himself O

It O
would O
look O
very O
smart O
upon O
one O
of O
the O
fine O

, O
which O
, O
with O


the O
gold O

that O
might O
easily O

to O

the O
Captain O

gold O

and O
the O
great O
double O


ring O
with O
the O
rubies O
, O
which O
he O
would O
have O
made O
into O
a O

of O
beautiful O

, O
he O
calculated O
would O
make O
a O
perfect O
Adonis B-PRODUCT
of O
himself O

and O
render O


Mademoiselle B-PERSON

 O
How O
those O

 O


thought O

what O
an O

in O

Verte B-ORG
! O
 O
So O
while O
Monsieur O
Isidor B-PERSON
with O
bodily O
fingers O
was O
holding O
on O
to O
his O


master O
’s O
nose O
, O
and O
shaving O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
Jos B-PERSON
’s O
face O
, O
his O
imagination O
was O


rambling O
along O
the B-FAC
Green I-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
, O
dressed O
out O
in O
a O
frogged O
coat O
and O
lace O
, O
and O


in O
company O
with O
Mademoiselle B-PERSON
Reine I-PERSON
; O
he O
was O
loitering O
in O
spirit O
on O
the O
banks O
, O


and O
examining O
the O
barges O
sailing O
slowly O
under O
the O
cool O
shadows O
of O
the O
trees O


by O
the O
canal O
, O
or O
refreshing O
himself O
with O
a O
mug O
of O
Faro B-PERSON
at O
the O
bench O
of O
a O


beer O
- O
house O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Laeken B-GPE
. O


But O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
, O
luckily O
for O
his O
own O
peace O
, O
no O
more O
knew O
what O
was O


passing O
in O
his O
domestic O
’s O
mind O
than O
the O
respected O
reader O
, O
and O
I O
suspect O
what O


John B-PERSON
or O
Mary B-PERSON
, O
whose O
wages O
we O
pay O
, O
think O
of O
ourselves O
. O
What O
our O
servants O


think O
of O
us!—Did O
we O
know O
what O
our O
intimates O
and O
dear O
relations O
thought O
of O


us O
, O
we O
should O
live O
in O
a O
world O
that O
we O
should O
be O
glad O
to O
quit O

and O
in O
a O
frame O


of O
mind O
and O
a O
constant O
terror O
, O
that O
would O
be O
perfectly O
unbearable O
. O
So O
Jos B-PERSON

man O
was O
marking O
his O
victim O
down O
, O
as O
you O
see O
one O
of O
Mr. O

in O

 O
Soup O

. O
 O


Amelia B-PERSON

attendant O
was O
much O
less O
selfishly O
disposed O
. O
Few O
dependants O
could O


come O
near O
that O
kind O
and O
gentle O
creature O
without O
paying O
their O
usual O
tribute O


of O
loyalty O
and O
affection O
to O
her O
sweet O
and O
affectionate O
nature O
. O
And O
it O
is O
a O


fact O
that O
Pauline B-PERSON
, O
the O
cook O
, O
consoled O
her O
mistress O
more O
than O
anybody O
whom O


she O
saw O
on O
this O
wretched O
morning O
; O
for O
when O
she O
found O
how O
Amelia B-PERSON
remained O
for O


hours B-TIME
, O
silent O
, O
motionless O
, O
and O
haggard O
, O
by O
the O
windows O
in O
which O
she O
had O


placed O
herself O
to O
watch O
the O
last O
bayonets O
of O
the O

as O
it O
marched O
away O
, O


the O
honest O

took O
the O

with O
which O
she O


burst O
into O
tears O
, O
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
falling O
into O
her O
arms O
, O
did O
likewise O
, O
and O
so O


each O
pitied O
and O
soothed O
the O
other O
. O


Several O
times O
during O
the O
forenoon O
Mr. O
Jos B-PERSON

Isidor B-PERSON
went O
from O
his O

into O
the O

to O
the O

round O
about O


the O

where O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE

congregated O

and O
there O
mingled O
with O
other O


valets O

couriers O

lackeys O
, O
gathered O
such O
news O
as O
was O
abroad O
, O
and O
brought O


back O

for O
his O

Almost O
all O
these O
gentlemen O
were O


in O
heart O
partisans O
of O
the O
Emperor O

had O
their O
opinions O
about O
the O
speedy O


end O

The O

 O

it O

 O
this O

the O

by O
which O
the O

Then O
, O
as O
after O
Austerlitz B-ORG

as O
after O
Wagram B-PERSON
, O
we O


were O
too O
generous O

We O
believed O
in O
the O
oaths O

promises O
of O
princes O

we O


suffered O

Let O

Those O

can O
tell O


their O

what O
frightful O
torments O
they O

on O

the O
English B-LANGUAGE


hulks O

Madmen O

a O
moment O
of O

has O
blinded O
them O

if O
they O
enter O


into O
France B-GPE
it O
will O
be O
to O
find O
a O
grave O
there O
! O
 O
But O
the O
partisans O
of O
the O


French B-NORP
prophesied O
a O
more O
speedy O
extermination O
of O
the O
Emperor O

enemies O

this O

and O
it O
was O
agreed O

return O

These O
opinions O
in O

thrust O


his O

into O
the O

in O
the O

Rebecca B-PERSON

very O
neatly O
and O
smartly O
, O
as O
usual O
: O
her O
quiet O
sleep O


after O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
departure O
had O
refreshed O
her O

and O
her O
pink O
smiling O
cheeks O
were O


quite O
pleasant O
to O
look O
at O
, O
in O
a O
town O
and O
on O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
when O
everybody O

countenance O
wore O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
deepest O
anxiety O

gloom O
. O
She O


laughed O
at O
the O
attitude O
in O
which O
Jos B-PERSON
was O
discovered O
, O
and O
the O
struggles O
and O


convulsions O
with O
which O
the O
stout O

thrust O
himself O
into O

 O
Are O
you O

Mr. O

 O


Jos B-PERSON
succeeded O
in O
plunging O
into O
the O

came O
forward O
blushing O

stuttering O
out O
excuses O
to O
his O

 O
How O
was O
she O
after O
the O

of O


the B-TIME

— O
after O

 O
Monsieur O


Isidor B-PERSON
disappeared O
into O
his O
master O

adjacent O
bed O

room O
, O
bearing O
off O
the O


flowered O
dressing O
- O
gown O

 O
How O
good O
of O
you O
to O
ask O
, O
 O
said O
she O
, O
pressing O
one O
of O
his O
hands O
in O
both O
her O


own O
. O
 O
How O
cool O
and O
collected O
you O
look O
when O
everybody O

frightened O
! O
How O


is O
our O
dear O
little O
Emmy B-PERSON
? O
It O
must O
have O
been O
an O
awful O
, O
awful O
parting O
. O
 O


 O
Tremendous O
, O
 O
Jos B-PERSON
said O
. O


 O
You O
men O
can O
bear O
anything O
, O
 O
replied O
the O
lady O
. O
 O
Parting O
or O
danger O
are O


nothing O
to O
you O
. O
Own O
now O
that O
you O
were O
going O
to O
join O
the O
army O
and O
leave O
us O
to O


our O
fate O
. O
I O
know O
you O
were O
— O
something O
tells O
me O
you O
were O
. O
I O
was O
so O
frightened O
, O


when O
the O
thought O
came O
into O
my O
head O
( O
for O
I O
do O
sometimes O
think O
of O
you O
when O
I O


am O
alone O
, O
Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
) O
, O
that O
I O
ran O
off O
immediately O
to O
beg O
and O
entreat O
you O
not O


to O
fly O
from O
us O
. O
 O


This O
speech O
might O
be O
interpreted O
, O
 O
My O
dear O
sir O
, O
should O
an O
accident O
befall O


the O
army O
, O
and O
a O
retreat O
be O
necessary O
, O
you O
have O
a O
very O
comfortable O
carriage O
, O


in O
which O
I O
propose O
to O
take O
a O
seat O
. O
 O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
whether O
Jos B-PERSON
understood O
the O


words O
in O
this O
sense O
. O
But O
he O
was O
profoundly O
mortified O
by O
the O
lady O
’s O


inattention O
to O
him O
during O
their O
stay O
at O
Brussels B-GPE
. O


He O
had O
never O
been O
presented O
to O
any O
of O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
’s O
great O
acquaintances O
; O


he O
had O
scarcely O
been O
invited O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
parties O
; O
for O
he O
was O
too O
timid O
to O


play O
much O
, O
and O
his O
presence O
bored O
George B-PERSON
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
equally O
, O
who O
neither O
of O


them O
, O
perhaps O
, O
liked O
to O
have O
a O
witness O
of O
the O
amusements O
in O
which O
the O
pair O


chose O
to O
indulge O
. O
 O
Ah O
! O
 O
thought O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
 O
now O
she O
wants O
me O
she O
comes O
to O
me O
. O
When O


there O
is O
nobody O
else O
in O
the O
way O
she O
can O
think O
about O
old O
Joseph B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
! O
 O
But O


besides O
these O
doubts O
he O
felt O
flattered O
at O
the O
idea O
Rebecca B-PERSON
expressed O
of O
his O


courage O
. O


He O
blushed O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
and O
put O
on O
an O
air O
of O
importance O
. O
 O
I O
should O
like O
to O


see O
the O
action O
, O
 O
he O
said O
. O
 O
Every O
man O
of O
any O
spirit O
would O
, O
you O
know O
. O
I O
’ve O


seen O
a O
little O
service O
in O
India B-GPE
, O
but O
nothing O
on O
this O
grand O
scale O
. O
 O


 O
You O
men O
would O
sacrifice O
any O
thing O
for O
a O
pleasure O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
answered O
. O


 O
Captain O
Crawley B-PERSON
left O
me O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
as O
gay O
as O
if O
he O
were O
going O
to O
a O


hunting O
party O
. O
What O
does O
he O
care O
? O
What O
do O
any O
of O
you O
care O
for O
the O
agonies O


and O
tortures O
of O
a O
poor O
forsaken O
woman O
? O
( O
I O
wonder O
whether O
he O

could O


really O
have O
been O
going O
to O
the O
troops O
, O
this O
great O
lazy O
gourmand O
? O
) O
Oh O
! O
dear O


Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
I O
have O
come O
to O
you O
for O
comfort O
— O
for O
consolation O
. O
I O
have O
been O
on O


my O
knees O
all O
the O
morning O
. O
I O
tremble O
at O
the O
frightful O
danger O
into O
which O
our O


husbands O
, O
our O
friends O
, O
our O
brave O
troops O
and O
allies O
, O
are O
rushing O
. O
And O
I O
come O


here O
for O
shelter O
, O
and O
find O
another O
of O
my O
friends O
— O
the O
last O
remaining O
to O


me O
— O
bent O
upon O
plunging O
into O
the O
dreadful O
scene O
! O
 O


 O
My O
dear O
madam O
, O
 O
Jos B-PERSON
replied O
, O
now O
beginning O
to O
be O
quite O
soothed O
, O
 O
do O
n’t O
be O


alarmed O
. O
I O
only O
said O
I O
should O
like O
to O
go O
— O
what O
Briton B-PERSON
would O
not O
? O
But O
my O
duty O


keeps O
me O
here O
: O
I O
ca O
n’t O
leave O
that O
poor O
creature O
in O
the O
next O
room O
. O
 O
And O
he O


pointed O
with O
his O
finger O
to O
the O
door O
of O
the O
chamber O
in O
which O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
. O


 O
Good O
noble O
brother O
! O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
, O
putting O
her O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O


and O
smelling O
the O
eau O
- O
de O
- O
cologne O
with O
which O
it O
was O
scented O
. O
 O
I O
have O
done O
you O


injustice O
; O
you O
have O
got O
a O
heart O
. O
I O
thought O
you O
had O
not O
. O
 O


 O
O O
, O
upon O
my O
honour O
! O
 O
Jos B-PERSON
said O
, O
making O
a O
motion O
as O
if O
he O
would O
lay O
his O
hand O


upon O
the O
spot O
in O
question O
. O
 O
You O
do O
me O
injustice O
, O
indeed O
you O
do O
— O
my O
dear O
Mrs. O


Crawley B-PERSON
. O
 O


 O
I O
do O
, O
now O
your O
heart O
is O
true O
to O
your O
sister O
. O
But O
I O
remember O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE


ago I-DATE
— O
when O
it O
was O
false O
to O
me O
! O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
, O
fixing O
her O
eyes O
upon O
him O
for O
an O


instant O
, O
and O
then O
turning O
away O
into O
the O
window O
. O


Jos B-PERSON
blushed O
violently O
. O
That O
organ O
which O
he O
was O
accused O
by O
Rebecca B-PERSON
of O
not O


possessing O
began O
to O
thump O
tumultuously O
. O
He O
recalled O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
when O
he O
had O


fled O
from O
her O
, O
and O
the O
passion O
which O
had O
once O
inflamed O
him O
— O
the B-DATE
days I-DATE
when O
he O


had O
driven O
her O
in O
his O
curricle O
: O
when O
she O
had O
knit O
the O
green O
purse O
for O
him O
: O


when O
he O
had O
sat O
enraptured O
gazing O
at O
her O
white O
arms O
and O
bright O
eyes O
. O


 O
I O
know O
you O
think O
me O
ungrateful O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
continued O
, O
coming O
out O
of O
the O


window O
, O
and O
once O
more O
looking O
at O
him O
and O
addressing O
him O
in O
a O
low O
tremulous O


voice O
. O
 O
Your O
coldness O
, O
your O
averted O
looks O
, O
your O
manner O
when O
we O
have O
met O
of O


late O
— O
when O
I O
came O
in O
just O
now O
, O
all O
proved O
it O
to O
me O
. O
But O
were O
there O
no O
reasons O


why O
I O
should O
avoid O
you O
? O
Let O
your O
own O
heart O
answer O
that O
question O
. O
Do O
you O


think O
my O
husband O
was O
too O
much O
inclined O
to O
welcome O
you O
? O
The O
only O
unkind O
words O


I O
have O
ever O
had O
from O
him O
( O
I O
will O
do O
Captain O
Crawley B-PERSON

have O
been O


about O
you O
— O
and O
most O
cruel O

cruel O
words O
they O
were O
. O
 O


 O
Good O
gracious O
! O
what O
have O
I O
done O
? O
 O
asked O
Jos B-PERSON
in O
a O
flurry O
of O
pleasure O
and O


perplexity O
; O
 O
what O
have O
I O
done O
— O
to O
— O
to O

? O
 O


 O
Is O
jealousy O
nothing O
? O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
He O
makes O
me O
miserable O
about O
you O
. O
And O


whatever O
it O
might O
have O
been O
once O
— O
my O
heart O
is O
all O

I O
am O

Mr. O

 O


All O
Jos B-PERSON

one B-CARDINAL

his O

his O

From O

Jos B-PERSON

almost O
with O
the O

Rebecca B-PERSON

bethought O

when O
Rebecca B-PERSON

green O


eyes O
lighted O
upon O
her O
, O
and O
rustling O
in O
her O
fresh O
silks O
and O
brilliant O


ornaments O
, O
the O
latter O
tripped O
up O
with O
extended O
arms O
to O
embrace O
her O
— O
a O
feeling O


of O
anger O
succeeded O
, O
and O
from O
being O
deadly O
pale O
before O
, O
her O
face O
flushed O
up O


red O
, O
and O
she O
returned O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
look O
after O
a O
moment O
with O
a O
steadiness O
which O


surprised O
and O
somewhat O
abashed O
her O
rival O
. O


 O
Dearest O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
you O
are O
very O
unwell O
, O
 O
the O
visitor O
said O
, O
putting O
forth O
her O


hand O
to O
take O
Amelia B-PERSON

. O
 O
What O
is O
it O
? O
I O
could O
not O
rest O
until O
I O
knew O
how O
you O


were O
. O
 O


Amelia B-PERSON
drew O
back O
her O
hand O
— O
never O
since O
her O
life O
began O
had O
that O
gentle O
soul O


refused O
to O
believe O

to O
answer O
any O

But O
she O
drew O
back O
her O

, O
and O
trembled O
all O
over O
. O
 O
Why O
are O

you O


here O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
? O
 O
she O
said O
, O
still O
looking O
at O
her O
solemnly O
with O
her O
large O
eyes O
. O


These O
glances O
troubled O
her O
visitor O
. O


 O
She O
must O
have O
seen O
him O
give O
me O
the O
letter O
at O
the O
ball O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
thought O
. O


 O
Do O
n’t O
be O
agitated O
, O
dear O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
looking O
down O
. O
 O
I O
came O
but O
to O

if O
I O
could O
— O
if O
you O
were O
well O

 O


 O
Are O
you O
well O
? O
 O
said O
Amelia B-PERSON
 O
I O
dare O
say O
you O
are O
. O
You O
do O
n’t O
love O
your O


husband O
. O
You O
would O
not O
be O
here O
if O
you O

Tell O
me O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
did O
I O
ever O
do O


you O
anything O
but O
kindness O
? O
 O


 O
Indeed O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
no O
, O
 O
the O
other O
said O
, O
still O
hanging O
down O
her O
head O

 O
When O
you O
were O
quite O
poor O
, O
who O
was O
it O
that O
befriended O
you O
? O
Was O
I O
not O
a O


sister O

You O
saw O
us O
all O
in O
happier O
days B-DATE
before O
he O
married O
me O

I O
was O


all O
in O
all O
then O
to O
him O
; O
or O
would O
he O
have O
given O
up O
his O
fortune O
, O
his O
family O
, O


as O
he O
nobly O
did O
to O
make O
me O
happy O
? O
Why O
did O
you O
come O
between O
my O
love O

me O
? O


Who O
sent O
you O
to O
separate O
those O
whom O
God O
joined O
, O
and O
take O
my O
darling O

heart O


from O
me O
— O
my O

Do O
you O
think O
you O
could O
love O
him O
as O
I O
did O
? O
His O
love O


was O
everything O
to O
me O

You O
knew O

, O
and O
wanted O
to O
rob O
me O
of O
it O

For O
shame O

Rebecca B-PERSON

 O
Have O
you O

me O

no O

Rebecca B-PERSON

You O

 O


She O

Rebecca B-PERSON

 O
He O

I O

I O
knew O
no O

I O
knew O

I O
prayed O
so O
that O
he O


should O

 O


The O
poor O
girl O
spoke O
these O
words O
with O
a O
spirit O
and O
volubility B-ORG
which O
Rebecca B-PERSON


had O
never O
before O
seen O
in O
her O

and O
before O
which O
the O

was O
quite O
dumb O

 O
But O
what O
have O
I O
done O
to O
you O
, O
 O
she O
continued O
in O
a O
more O
pitiful O
tone O
, O
 O
that O


you O
should O
try O
and O
take O
him O
from O
me O
? O
I O
had O
him O
but O
for O
six B-DATE

You O
might O


have O

, O
Rebecca B-PERSON

And O
yet O

from O
the B-DATE
very I-DATE
first I-DATE

Now O
he O

are O
you O

see O
how O


unhappy O
I O

 O
she O
continued O

 O
You O
made O
me O
wretched O
enough O
for O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE

: O
you O
might O

 O


 O
I O
— O
I O
never O

 O
interposed O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
with O
unlucky O
truth O
. O


 O
No O
. O
You O
did O
n’t O
come O
. O
You O
took O
him O
away O
. O
Are O
you O
come O
to O
fetch O
him O
from O


me O
? O
 O
she O
continued O
in O
a O
wilder O
tone O
. O
 O
He O
was O
here O
, O
but O
he O
is O
gone O
now O
. O
There O


on O
that O
very O

he O
sate O

Do O

We O
sate O

talked O
there O

I O
was O


on O
his O
knee O

and O
my O
arms O
were O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
we O
said O
‘ O
Our O

Yes O

he O
was O
here O
: O
and O
they O
came O

 O


 O
He O

Amelia B-PERSON

 O
this O
is O
his O

isn’t O
it O
a O
pretty O
colour O
? O
 O
and O
she O


took O
up O
the O
fringe O
and O
kissed O
it O
. O
She O
had O
tied O
it O
round O
her O
waist O
at O
some O


part O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE

She O
had O
forgotten O
her O
anger O

her O
jealousy O
, O
the O
very O


presence O
of O
her O

seemingly O
. O
For O
she O
walked O
silently O
and O
almost O
with O
a O


smile O
on O
her O
face O
, O
towards O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
began O
to O
smooth O
down O
George B-PERSON

pillow O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
walked O
, O
too O
, O
silently O
away O
. O
 O
How O
is O
Amelia B-PERSON

 O
asked O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
who O
still O


held O
his O
position O
in O
the O
chair O

 O
There O
should O
be O
somebody O
with O
her O
, O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
 O
I O
think O
she O
is O
very O


unwell O
; O
 O
and O
she O
went O
away O
with O
a O
very O
grave O
face O
, O
refusing O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O


entreaties O
that O
she O
would O
stay O
and O
partake O
of O
the O
early O
dinner O
which O
he O
had O


ordered O
. O


Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
of O
a O
good O
- O
natured O
and O
obliging O
disposition O
; O
and O
she O
liked O


Amelia B-PERSON
rather O
than O
otherwise O
. O
Even O
her O
hard O
words O
, O
reproachful O
as O
they O
were O
, O


were O
complimentary O
— O
the O
groans O
of O
a O

stinging O
under O

Meeting O


Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
, O
whom O
the O
Dean B-PERSON

from O
Mrs. O

informing O
her O

Mrs. O


Osborne B-PERSON

in O
a O
desperate O
condition O
, O

almost O
mad O
with O

sent O
off O


the O

Irishwoman B-NORP
straight O

 O
I O

, O
 O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
said O
, O
gravely O
, O
 O
and O
I O
thought O


poor O
Amelia B-PERSON
would O
be O
little O
wanting O
for O

this B-DATE

But O
if O
she O

so O


bad O
as O

you O
ca O
n’t O
attend O
to O

I O

 O


with O

a O

a O


farewell O
of O
Mrs. O

by O
no O

courted O

Becky B-PERSON
watched O
her O
marching O
off O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
on O
her O
lip O
. O
She O
had O
the O


keenest O
sense O
of O
humour O
, O
and O
the O
Parthian B-NORP
look O
which O
the O
retreating O
Mrs. O


O’Dowd B-PERSON
flung O
over O
her O
shoulder O
almost O
upset O
Mrs. O

My O

The O
poor O

stood O


almost O

The O

They O

Crowds B-PERSON

Each O

asked O

even O


great O
English B-NORP
lords O

condescended O
to O

to O
persons O
whom O
they O


did O
not O

The O
friends O
of O
the O
French B-NORP

wild O
with O

prophesying O
the O

The O

Women O
rushed O


to O
the O

and O
crowded O
the O
chapels O
, O
and O
knelt O
and O
prayed O
on O
the O
flags O


and O
steps O

The O
dull O
sound O
of O
the O
cannon O
went O
on O
rolling O
, O
rolling O

Presently O


carriages O
with O
travellers O
began O
to O
leave O
the O
town O
, O
galloping O
away O
by O
the O


Ghent B-GPE
barrier O

The O
prophecies O
of O
the O
French B-NORP

 O
He O

Isidor B-PERSON

 O
The O

out O
from O

the O

always O
returning O


with O
some O
fresh O

Jos B-PERSON

grew O
paler O

paler O

Alarm O
began O
to O
take O
entire O
possession O
of O
the O
stout O
civilian O
. O
All O
the O


champagne O
he O
drank O
brought O
no O
courage O
to O
him O
. O
Before O
sunset O
he O
was O
worked O
up O


to O
such O
a O
pitch O
of O
nervousness O
as O
gratified O
his O
friend O
Isidor B-PERSON
to O
behold O
, O
who O


now O
counted O
surely O
upon O
the O
spoils O
of O
the O

the O

The O
women O
were O
away O
all O

time O

After O
hearing O
the O
firing O
for O
a O
moment O
, O


the O
stout O
Major O

wife O
bethought O
her O
of O
her O
friend O
in O
the O
next O
chamber O
, O
and O


ran O
in O
to O
watch O
, O
and O
if O
possible O
to O
console O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
The O
idea O
that O
she O
had O


that O
helpless O
and O
gentle O
creature O
to O
protect O
, O
gave O
additional O
strength O
to O


the O
natural O
courage O
of O
the O
honest O
Irishwoman B-NORP
. O
She O
passed O
five B-TIME
hours I-TIME
by O
her O


friend O

side O
, O
sometimes O
in O
remonstrance O
, O
sometimes O
talking O
cheerfully O
, O


oftener O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
terrified O
mental O
supplication O
. O
 O
I O
never O
let O
go O
her O


hand O
once O
, O
 O
said O
the O
stout O
lady O
afterwards O
, O
 O
until O
after O
sunset O
, O
when O
the O


firing O
was O
over O
. O
 O
Pauline B-PERSON

the O

When O
the O

of O
the O

Mrs. O

issued O
out O

Amelia B-PERSON

with O

Once O
or O
twice O
he O
had O
ventured O
into O
his O


sister O

room O
, O
looking O
very O
much O
alarmed O
, O
and O
as O
if O
he O
would O
say O


something O
. O
But O
the O
Major O

wife O
kept O
her O
place O
, O
and O
he O
went O
away O
without O


disburthening O
himself O
of O
his O
speech O
. O
He O
was O
ashamed O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
he O


wanted O
to O
fly O

But O
when O
she O
made O
her O
appearance O
in O
the O
dining O

where O
he O
sate O
in O
the O


twilight O
in O
the O
cheerless O
company O
of O
his O
empty O

he O
began O


to O
open O
his O

to O
her O

 O
Mrs. O

 O
I O

Jos B-PERSON

wild O

Isidor B-PERSON

Jos B-PERSON
was O
not O
the O

in O
Brussels B-GPE

that B-DATE

But O
Jos B-PERSON

great O

cruel O
as O
they O
were O
already O

were O
destined O
to O

to O
an O
almost O

before O
the B-TIME

It O

This O

The O

Van B-PERSON

Pauline B-PERSON

Whilst O
in O

at O
Brussels B-GPE


young O
Regulus O
( O
he O
had O
been O
born O
in O
the O
revolutionary O
times O

found O
his O
great O


comfort O
, O
and O
passed O
almost O
all O
his O
leisure O
moments O
, O
in O
Pauline B-PERSON
’s O
kitchen O
; O


and O
it O
was O
with O
pockets O
and O
holsters O
crammed O
full O
of O
good O
things O
from O
her O


larder O
, O
that O
he O
had O
taken O

his O

to O
proceed O
upon O


the O

a B-DATE

As O
far O
as O
his O
regiment O
was O
concerned O
, O
this O
campaign O
was O
over O
now O
. O
They O
had O


formed O
a O
part O
of O
the O
division O
under O
the O
command O
of O
his O
Sovereign O
apparent O
, O


the B-ORG
Prince I-ORG
of I-ORG
Orange I-ORG
, O
and O
as O
respected O
length O
of O

mustachios O
, O
and O


the O
richness O
of O
uniform O
and O
equipments O
, O
Regulus O
and O
his O
comrades O
looked O
to O


be O
as O
gallant O
a O
body O
of O
men O
as O
ever O
trumpet O
sounded O
for O

When O
Ney B-PERSON
dashed O
upon O
the O
advance O
of O
the O
allied O
troops O
, O
carrying O
one B-CARDINAL


position O
after O
the O
other O
, O
until O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
great O
body O
of O
the O
British B-NORP


army O
from O
Brussels B-GPE
changed O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
combat O
of O
Quatre B-ORG
Bras I-ORG
, O
the O


squadrons O
among O
which O
Regulus O
rode O
showed O
the O
greatest O
activity O
in O


retreating O
before O
the O
French B-NORP
, O
and O
were O
dislodged O
from O
one O
post O
and O
another O


which O
they O
occupied O
with O
perfect O
alacrity O
on O
their O
part O
. O
Their O
movements O


were O
only O
checked O
by O
the O
advance O
of O
the O
British B-NORP
in O
their O
rear O
. O
Thus O
forced O


to O
halt O
, O
the O
enemy O
’s O
cavalry O
( O
whose O
bloodthirsty O
obstinacy O
can O
not O
be O
too O


severely O
reprehended O
) O
, O
had O
at O
length O
an O
opportunity O
of O
coming O
to O
close O


quarters O
with O
the O
brave O
Belgians B-NORP
before O
them O
; O
who O
preferred O
to O
encounter O
the O


British B-NORP
rather O
than O
the O
French B-NORP
, O
and O
at O
once O
turning O
tail O
rode O
through O
the O


English B-LANGUAGE
regiments O
that O
were O
behind O
them O
, O
and O
scattered O
in O
all O

The O

any O

It O
was O
nowhere O

It O
had O
no O

Regulus O
found O
himself O
galloping O
many O

from O
the O

of O


action O

entirely O
alone O
; O
and O
whither O
should O
he O
fly O
for O

so O
naturally O
as O


to O
that O
kitchen O

those O
faithful O

in O
which O
Pauline B-PERSON
had O
so O
often O


welcomed O
him O
? O


At O
some B-TIME
ten I-TIME

the O
clinking O
of O
a O

might O
have O

heard O
up O
the O

the O

a O

A O

at O
the O

and O
poor O


Pauline B-PERSON
, O
come O
back O
from O

fainted O
almost O
with O
terror O
as O
she O
opened O
it O


and O
saw O
before O
her O
her O
haggard O
hussar O

He O
looked O
as O
pale O
as O
the O
midnight B-TIME


dragoon O
who O
came O
to O
disturb O
Leonora B-PERSON

Pauline B-PERSON
would O
have O

that O


her O

have O
called O
her O
masters O

discovered O
her O

She O


stifled O
her O
scream O
, O
then O
, O
and O
leading O
her O
hero O
into O
the O
kitchen O
, O
gave O
him O


beer O

the O
choice O

from O
the O

, O
which O
Jos B-PERSON
had O
not O
had O
the O

to O

The O
hussar O
showed O
he O
was O
no O
ghost O
by O
the O
prodigious O
quantity O
of O


flesh O

beer O
which O
he O
devoured O

and O
during O
the O
mouthfuls O
he O
told O
his O

of O

His O
regiment O

performed O
prodigies O
of O

had O
withstood O
for O

the O

But O
they O
were O
overwhelmed O
at O

as O

Ney B-PERSON
destroyed O

up O

The O

the O

The O

 O

went O
off O

into O
hysterics O

and O
filled O
the O
house O
with O
her O
screams O

Wild O
with O
terror O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
knew O
not O
how O
or O
where O
to O
seek O
for O
safety O
. O
He O


rushed O
from O
the O
kitchen O
back O
to O
the O
sitting O
- O
room O
, O
and O
cast O
an O
appealing O
look O


at O
Amelia B-PERSON

door O
, O
which O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
had O
closed O
and O
locked O
in O
his O
face O
; O
but O


he O
remembered O
how O
scornfully O
the O
latter O
had O
received O
him O
, O
and O
after O
pausing O


and O
listening O
for O
a O
brief O
space O
at O
the O
door O
, O
he O
left O
it O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
go O


into O
the O
street O
, O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
day O
. O
So O
, O
seizing O
a O
candle O
, O
he O


looked O
about O
for O
his O
gold O
- O
laced O
cap O
, O
and O
found O
it O
lying O
in O
its O
usual O
place O
, O


on O
a O
console O
- O
table O
, O
in O
the O
anteroom O
, O
placed O
before O
a O
mirror O
at O
which O
Jos B-PERSON


used O
to O
coquet B-ORG
, O
always O
giving O
his O
side O
- O
locks O
a O
twirl O
, O
and O
his O
cap O
the O
proper O


cock O
over O
his O
eye O
, O
before O
he O
went O
forth O
to O
make O
appearance O
in O
public O
. O
Such O


is O
the O
force O
of O
habit O
, O
that O
even O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O
terror O
he O
began O


mechanically O
to O
twiddle O
with O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
arrange O
the O
cock O
of O
his O
hat O
. O
Then O


he O
looked O
amazed O
at O
the O
pale O
face O
in O
the O
glass O
before O
him O
, O
and O
especially O
at O


his O
mustachios O
, O
which O
had O
attained O
a O
rich O
growth O
in O
the O
course O
of O
near O
seven B-DATE


weeks I-DATE
, O
since O
they O
had O
come O
into O
the O
world O
. O
They O

will O

mistake O
me O
for O


a O
military O
man O
thought O
he O
, O
remembering O
Isidor B-PERSON
’s O
warning O
, O
as O
to O
the O
massacre O


with O
which O
all O
the O
defeated O
British B-NORP
army O
was O
threatened O
; O
and O
staggering O
back O


to O
his O
bed O
- O
chamber O
, O
he O
began O
wildly O
pulling O
the O
bell O
which O
summoned O
his O


valet O
. O


Isidor B-PERSON
answered O
that O
summons O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
had O
sunk O
in O
a O
chair O
— O
he O
had O
torn O
off O
his O


neckcloths B-PERSON

and O
turned O
down O
his O
collars O

and O
was O
sitting O
with O
both O
his O

lifted O
to O
his O
throat O

 O
shouted O
he O
; O

 O


Isidor B-PERSON
thought O
for O
a O
moment O
he O
had O
gone O
mad O
, O
and O
that O
he O
wished O
his O
valet O


to O
cut O

Isidor B-PERSON
swept O
off O

no O

and O
heard O
with O


inexpressible O

he O
plunged O
swiftly O
down O

passed O
into O

Although O

The O
arrival O

expected O
hourly B-TIME

the O

preparations O

No O

thought O
Jos B-PERSON

in O


terror O

He O
made O
Isidor B-PERSON
inquire O
of O
scores O
of O
persons O

whether O
they O
had O
any O
to O


lend O
or O
sell O
, O
and O
his O
heart O
sank O
within O
him O
, O
at O
the O
negative O

returned O
everywhere O

Should O
he O
take O
the O
journey O
on O

Even O
fear O

not O


render O
that O

Almost O
all O
the O

the O
English B-LANGUAGE

the O
Parc O

and O
Jos B-PERSON
wandered O
irresolutely O
about O
in O
this B-DATE

with O
crowds O
of O
other O


people O
, O
oppressed O
as O
he O
was O
by O
fear O

curiosity O

Some O
families O
he O
saw O
more O


happy O
than O
himself O
, O
having O
discovered O
a O
team O
of O

and O
rattling O
through O


the O

others O
again O
there O

who O

the O

Amongst O
these O
would O

Jos B-PERSON

the O

all O

the O

the O

Rebecca B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
occupied O

had O
before O

sundry O

My O

on O

; O


and O
in O
all O
places O
where O
the O

name O
was O
mentioned O
, O
spoke O
perseveringly O


ill O
of O
her O

The O
Countess B-ORG

shocked O
at O
the O

of O
General O


Tufto B-PERSON
with O
the O

The O
Lady O

avoided O
her O
as O
if O
she O


had O
been O
an O
infectious O
disease O
. O
Only O
the O
Earl B-PERSON
himself O
kept O
up O
a O
sly O


occasional O
acquaintance O
with O
her O
, O
when O
out O
of O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
his O


ladies O

Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
her O
revenge O
now O
upon O
these O
insolent O
enemies O
. O
It O
became O
known O
in O


the O
hotel O
that O
Captain O
Crawley B-PERSON

horses O
had O
been O
left O
behind O
, O
and O
when O
the O


panic O
began O
, O
Lady B-PERSON

condescended O
to O
send O
her O

the O
Captain O

her O

compliments O

a O
desire O
to O
know O
the O
price O
of O
Mrs. O


Crawley B-PERSON

Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
returned O
a O
note O
with O
her O

an O


intimation O
that O
it O
was O
not O
her O
custom O
to O

bargains O
with O

maids O

This O
curt O
reply O
brought O
the O
Earl B-PERSON
in O
person O
to O
Becky B-PERSON
’s O
apartment O
: O
but O
he O


could O
get O
no O
more O
success O
than O
the O

ambassador O

 O
Send O
a O
lady O

maid O
to O


me O
! O
 O

Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
cried O
in O
great O
anger O
; O
 O
why O
did O
n’t O
my O
Lady O


Bareacres B-PERSON
tell O
me O
to O
go O

Is O
it O

And O
this O
was O
all O


the O
answer O
that O
the O
Earl B-PERSON
bore O
back O
to O
his O
Countess B-ORG

What O
will O
not O

do O
? O
The O
Countess B-ORG
herself O
actually O
came O
to O
wait O
upon O


Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
on O
the O
failure O
of O
her O
second B-ORDINAL
envoy O

She O
entreated O
her O
to O

her O

she O
even O
offered O
to O
invite O
Becky B-PERSON
to O
Bareacres B-PERSON
House I-PERSON

if O
the O


latter O
would O
but O
give O
her O
the O
means O
of O
returning O
to O
that O
residence O

Mrs. O


Crawley B-PERSON
sneered O
at O
her O

 O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
be O
waited O
on O
by O

 O

at O

not O
you O

I O
would O
not O

not O
for O
the O

that O
your O

wore O
at O
the O

 O
Lady O


Bareacres B-PERSON

The O

The O

the O
pleasure O

 O
Did O

Jos B-PERSON

the O
carriage O
to O
pieces O
, O
if O
you O
put O
him O
in O
the O
traces O
. O
 O


 O
But O
he O
is O
quiet O
to O
ride O
? O
 O
asked O
the O
civilian O
. O


 O
As O
quiet O
as O
a O
lamb O
, O
and O
as O
fast O
as O
a O
hare O
, O
 O
answered O
Rebecca B-PERSON
. O


 O
Do O
you O
think O
he O
is O
up O
to O
my O
weight O
? O
 O
Jos B-PERSON
said O
. O
He O
was O
already O
on O
his O
back O
, O


in O
imagination O
, O
without O
ever O
so O
much O
as O
a O
thought O
for O
poor O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
What O


person O
who O
loved O
a O
horse O
- O
speculation O
could O
resist O
such O
a O
temptation O
? O


In O
reply O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
asked O
him O
to O
come O
into O
her O
room O
, O
whither O
he O
followed O
her O


quite O
breathless O
to O
conclude O
the O
bargain O
. O
Jos O
seldom O
spent O
a B-TIME
half I-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
in O


his O
life O
which O
cost O
him O
so O
much O
money O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
measuring O
the O
value O
of O
the O


goods O
which O
she O
had O
for O
sale O
by O
Jos B-ORG
’s O
eagerness O
to O
purchase O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O


the O
scarcity O
of O
the O
article O
, O
put O
upon O
her O
horses O
a O
price O
so O
prodigious O
as O
to O


make O
even O
the O
civilian O
draw O
back O
. O
 O
She O
would O
sell O
both O
or O
neither O
, O
 O
she O


said O
, O
resolutely O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
ordered O
her O
not O
to O
part O
with O
them O
, O
for O
a O
price O


less O
than O
that O
which O
she O
specified O
. O
Lord O
Bareacres B-PERSON
below O
would O
give O
her O
the O


same O
money O
— O
and O
with O
all O
her O
love O
and O
regard O
for O
the O
Sedley B-PERSON
family O
, O
her O
dear O


Mr. O
Joseph B-PERSON
must O
conceive O
that O
poor O
people O
must O
live O
— O
nobody O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
could O


be O
more O
affectionate O
, O
but O
more O
firm O
about O
the O
matter O
of O
business O
. O


Jos B-PERSON
ended O
by O
agreeing O
, O
as O
might O
be O
supposed O
of O
him O
. O
The O
sum O
he O
had O
to O
give O


her O
was O
so O
large O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
ask O
for O
time O
; O
so O
large O
as O
to O
be O
a O


little O
fortune O
to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
who O
rapidly O
calculated O
that O
with O
this O
sum O
, O
and O


the O
sale O
of O
the O
residue O
of O
Rawdon B-GPE
’s O
effects O
, O
and O
her O
pension O
as O
a O
widow O


should O
he O
fall O
, O
she O
would O
now O
be O
absolutely O
independent O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O


might O
look O
her O
weeds O
steadily O
in O
the O
face O
. O


Once O
or O
twice O
in O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
she O
certainly O
had O
herself O
thought O
about O
flying O
. O


But O
her O
reason O
gave O
her O
better O
counsel O
. O
 O
Suppose O
the O
French B-NORP
do O
come O
, O
 O


thought O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
 O
what O
can O
they O
do O
to O
a O
poor O
officer O
’s O
widow O
? O
Bah O
! O
the O
times O


of O
sacks O
and O
sieges O
are O
over O
. O
We O
shall O
be O
let O
to O
go O
home O
quietly O
, O
or O
I O
may O


live O
pleasantly O
abroad O
with O
a O
snug O
little O
income O
. O
 O


Meanwhile O
Jos B-PERSON
and O
Isidor B-PERSON
went O
off O
to O
the O
stables O
to O
inspect O
the O


newly O
- O
purchased O
cattle O
. O
Jos O
bade O
his O
man O
saddle O
the O
horses O
at O
once O
. O
He O
would O


ride O
away O
that B-TIME
very I-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
that B-TIME
very I-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O
And O
he O
left O
the O
valet O
busy O
in O


getting O
the O
horses O
ready O
, O
and O
went O
homewards O
himself O
to O
prepare O
for O
his O


departure O
. O
It O
must O
be O
secret O
. O
He O
would O
go O
to O
his O
chamber O
by O
the O
back O


entrance O
. O
He O
did O
not O
care O
to O
face O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
and O
own O
to O
them O


that O
he O
was O
about O
to O
run O
. O


By O
that O
time O
Jos B-PERSON
’s O
bargain O
with O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
completed O
, O
and O
his O
horses O
had O


been O
visited O
and O
examined O
, O
it O
was O
almost B-TIME
morning I-TIME
once O
more O
. O
But O
though O


midnight B-TIME
was O
long O
passed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
rest O
for O
the O
city O
; O
the O
people O
were O


up O
, O
the O
doors O
, O
and O
the O
streets O
were O
busy O
. O
Rumours O
of O
various O
natures O
went O


still O
from O
mouth O
to O
mouth O
: O
one B-CARDINAL
report O
averred O
that O
the O
Prussians B-NORP
had O
been O


utterly O
defeated O
; O
another O
that O
it O
was O
the O
English B-LANGUAGE
who O
had O
been O
attacked O
and O


conquered O
: O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
that O
the O
latter O
had O
held O
their O
ground O
. O
This O
last O
rumour O


gradually O
got O
strength O
. O
No O
Frenchmen O
had O
made O
their O
appearance O
. O
Stragglers B-ORG


had O
come O
in O
from O
the O
army O
bringing O
reports O
more O
and O
more O
favourable O
: O
at O
last O


an O
aide O

de O

camp O
actually O
reached O
Brussels B-GPE
with O
despatches O
for O
the O
Commandant O


of O
the O
place O
, O
who O
placarded O
presently O
through O
the O

an O
official O


announcement O
of O
the O
success O
of O
the O

at O
Quatre B-FAC

, O
and O
the O
entire O


repulse O
of O
the O
French B-NORP
under O
Ney B-PERSON
after O
a B-TIME
six I-TIME
hours I-TIME
’ O
battle O
. O
The O
aide O
- O
de O
- O
camp O


must O
have O
arrived O
sometime O
while O
Jos B-PERSON
and O
Rebecca B-PERSON
were O
making O
their O
bargain O


together O
, O
or O
the O
latter O
was O
inspecting O
his O
purchase O
. O
When O
he O
reached O
his O
own O


hotel O
, O
he O
found O
a O
score O
of O
its O
numerous O
inhabitants O
on O
the O
threshold O


discoursing O
of O
the O
news O
; O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
as O
to O
its O
truth O
. O
And O
he O
went O
up O


to O
communicate O
it O
to O
the O
ladies O
under O
his O
charge O
. O
He O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O


necessary O
to O
tell O
them O
how O
he O
had O
intended O
to O
take O
leave O
of O
them O

how O
he O
had O


bought O
horses O
, O
and O
what O
a O
price O
he O
had O
paid O
for O
them O
. O


But O
success O
or O
defeat O
was O
a O
minor O
matter O
to O
them O
, O
who O
had O
only O
thought O
for O


the O
safety O
of O
those O
they O
loved O
. O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
news O
of O
the O
victory O
, O
became O


still O
more O
agitated O
even O
than O
before O
. O
She O
was O
for O
going O
that O
moment O
to O
the O


army O
. O
She O
besought O
her O
brother O
with O
tears O
to O
conduct O
her O
thither O
. O
Her O
doubts O


and O
terrors O
reached O
their O
paroxysm O
; O
and O
the O
poor O
girl O
, O
who O
for O
many B-TIME
hours I-TIME


had O
been O
plunged O
into O
stupor O
, O
raved O
and O
ran O
hither O
and O
thither O
in O
hysteric O


insanity O
— O
a O
piteous O
sight O
. O
No O
man O
writhing O

fifteen B-QUANTITY

off O

after O

so O
many O
of O
the O

no O


man O
suffered O
more O
keenly O
than O
this O
poor O

victim O
of O
the O
war O
. O
Jos O


could O
not O
bear O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
pain O
. O
He O
left O
his O
sister O
in O
the O

of O


her O
stouter O
female O
companion O
, O
and O
descended O
once O
more O
to O
the O

the O

where O
everybody O
still O
lingered O

talked O

It O
grew O
to O
be O
broad O
daylight O
as O
they O
stood O
here O
, O
and O
fresh O
news O
began O
to O


arrive O
from O
the O

brought O
by O
men O

actors O
in O
the O

Wagons O


and O
long O
country O
carts O
laden O
with O
wounded O
came O
rolling O
into O
the O
town O
; O


ghastly O
groans O
came O
from O
within O
them O
, O
and O
haggard O
faces O
looked O
up O
sadly O
from O


out O
of O
the O
straw O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON
was O
looking O
at O
one O
of O
these O
carriages O
with O
a O


painful O
curiosity O
— O
the O
moans O
of O
the O
people O
within O
were O
frightful O
— O
the O
wearied O


horses O
could O
hardly O
pull O
the O

 O
Stop O
! O
stop O
! O
 O
a O
feeble O
voice O
cried O
from O


the O
straw O
, O
and O
the O
carriage O
stopped O
opposite O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON

hotel O
. O


 O
It O

George B-PERSON

I O
know O
it O

 O
cried O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
rushing O
in O
a O
moment O
to O
the O


balcony O
, O
with O
a O
pallid O
face O
and O
loose O

It O

not O
George B-PERSON

however O

but O
it O
was O
the O

it O
was O

of O
him O

It O
was O
poor O
Tom B-PERSON

gallantly O


twenty B-TIME

bearing O
the O

of O
the O

upon O

A O
French B-NORP

speared O
the O


young O

in O
the O

who O
fell O

still O
bravely O
holding O
to O
his O

At O
the O


conclusion O
of O
the O

a O

for O
the O

 O
Mr. O

Mr. O

 O
cried O
the O
boy O
, O
faintly O
, O
and O
Jos B-PERSON
came O
up O
almost O


frightened O
at O
the O
appeal O
. O
He O
had O
not O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
distinguished O
who O
it O
was O
that O


called O
him O

Little O
Tom B-PERSON

The O

large O

the O

all O

upstairs O

Osborne B-PERSON

Amelia B-PERSON

the O
Major O

him O

when O

You O

the O

that O
the B-DATE

in O

rapture O
Amelia B-PERSON
fell O
on O
her O
good O


friend O

and O
embraced O
her O
; O
in O
what O
a O
grateful O
passion O
of O

she O


fell O
on O
her O

, O
and O
thanked O
the O
Power O

saved O
her O

Our O
young O

in O

that O
which O


chance O

She O

Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
watched O
incessantly O
by O
the O


wounded O

very O
severe O

and O
in O
the O

The O

the O

the O

our O

Amelia B-PERSON
turned O

pale O
at O
the O
notion O

that O


Mrs. O

stopped O

it O

at O
the B-DATE

the I-DATE

, O
though O
wounded O

thence O
to O
the O

it O

 O


Young B-PERSON

vowed O
there O

not O
such O
another O

never O
ceased O
his O
praises O
of O

his O
admirable O

To O
these O
parts O
of O
the O

Amelia B-PERSON
lent O
a O
very O

attention O
: O
it O

only O
when O

spoken O


of O

when O

about O


him O

In O

of O
the O
wonderful O
escapes O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE


before O
, O
her O
second B-ORDINAL
day O
passed O
away O
not O
too O
slowly O
with O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
There O
was O


only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
man O
in O
the O
army O
for O
her O
: O
and O
as O
long O
as O
he O
was O
well O
, O
it O
must O
be O


owned O
that O
its O
movements O
interested O
her O
little O
. O
All O
the O
reports O
which O
Jos B-PERSON


brought O
from O
the O
street O
fell O
very O
vaguely O
on O
her O
ears O
; O
though O
they O
were O


sufficient O
to O
give O
that O
timorous O
gentleman O
, O
and O
many O
other O
people O
then O
in O


Brussels B-GPE
, O
every O
disquiet O
. O
The O
French B-NORP
had O
been O
repulsed O
certainly O
, O
but O
it O
was O


after O
a O
severe O
and O
doubtful O
struggle O
, O
and O
with O
only O
a O
division O
of O
the O
French B-NORP


army O
. O
The O
Emperor O
, O
with O
the O
main O
body O
, O
was O
away O
at O
Ligny B-ORG
, O
where O
he O
had O


utterly O
annihilated O
the O
Prussians B-NORP
, O
and O
was O
now O
free O
to O
bring O
his O
whole O
force O


to O
bear O
upon O
the O
allies O
. O
The O
Duke O
of O
Wellington B-GPE
was O
retreating O
upon O
the O


capital O
, O
and O
a O
great O
battle O
must O
be O
fought O
under O
its O
walls O
probably O
, O
of O


which O
the O
chances O
were O
more O
than O
doubtful O
. O
The O
Duke O
of O
Wellington B-GPE
had O
but O


twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
British B-NORP
troops O
on O
whom O
he O
could O
rely O
, O
for O
the O
Germans B-NORP
were O


raw O
militia O
, O
the O
Belgians B-NORP
disaffected O
; O
and O
with O
his O
handful O
his O
Grace B-PERSON
had O
to O


resist O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
fifty I-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
men O
that O
had O
broken O
into O
Belgium B-GPE
under O


Napoleon B-PERSON
. O
Under O
Napoleon O
! O
What O
warrior O
was O
there O
, O
however O
famous O
and O


skilful O
, O
that O
could O
fight O
at O
odds O
with O
him O
? O


Jos B-PERSON
thought O
of O
all O
these O
things O
, O
and O
trembled O
. O
So O
did O
all O
the O
rest O
of O


Brussels B-GPE
— O
where O
people O
felt O
that O
the O
fight O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
before O
was O
but O
the O


prelude O
to O
the O
greater O
combat O
which O
was O
imminent O
. O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
armies O
opposed O


to O
the O
Emperor O
was O
scattered O
to O
the O
winds O
already O
. O
The O
few O
English B-LANGUAGE
that O


could O
be O
brought O
to O
resist O
him O
would O
perish O
at O
their O
posts O
, O
and O
the O


conqueror O
would O
pass O
over O
their O
bodies O
into O
the O
city O
. O
Woe O
be O
to O
those O
whom O


he O
found O
there O
! O
Addresses O
were O
prepared O
, O
public O
functionaries O
assembled O
and O


debated O
secretly O
, O
apartments O
were O
got O
ready O
, O
and O
tricoloured B-ORG
banners O
and O


triumphal O
emblems O
manufactured O
, O
to O
welcome O
the O
arrival O
of O
His O
Majesty O
the O


Emperor O
and O
King B-PERSON
. O


The O
emigration O
still O
continued O
, O
and O
wherever O
families O
could O
find O
means O
of O


departure O
, O
they O
fled O
. O
When O
Jos B-PERSON
, O
on O
the B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
17th I-TIME
of I-TIME
June I-TIME
, O
went O


to O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
hotel O
, O
he O
found O
that O
the O
great O
Bareacres B-PERSON
’ O
carriage O
had O
at O


length O
rolled O
away O
from O
the O

porte O
- O
cochère O
. O

The O
Earl B-PERSON
had O
procured O
a O


pair O
of O
horses O
somehow O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
and O
was O
rolling O
on O
the O


road O
to O
Ghent B-GPE
. O
Louis B-PERSON
the I-PERSON
Desired I-PERSON
was O
getting O
ready O
his O
portmanteau O
in O
that O


city O
, O
too O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
Misfortune O
was O
never O
tired O
of O
worrying O
into O


motion O
that O
unwieldy O
exile O
. O


Jos B-PERSON
felt O
that O
the O
delay O
of O
yesterday B-DATE
had O
been O
only O
a O
respite O
, O
and O
that O
his O


dearly O
bought O
horses O
must O
of O
a O
surety O
be O
put O
into O
requisition O
. O
His O
agonies O


were O
very O
severe O
all O
this O
day O
. O
As O
long O
as O
there O
was O
an O
English B-NORP
army O
between O


Brussels B-GPE
and O
Napoleon B-GPE
, O
there O
was O
no O
need O
of O
immediate O
flight O
; O
but O
he O
had O
his O


horses O
brought O
from O
their O
distant O
stables O
, O
to O
the O
stables O
in O
the O
court O
- O
yard O


of O
the O
hotel O
where O
he O
lived O
; O
so O
that O
they O
might O
be O
under O
his O
own O
eyes O
, O
and O


beyond O
the O
risk O
of O
violent O
abduction O
. O
Isidor B-PERSON
watched O
the O
stable O
- O
door O


constantly O
, O
and O
had O
the O
horses O
saddled O
, O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
the O
start O
. O
He O
longed O


intensely O
for O
that O
event O
. O


After O
the O
reception O
of O
the B-DATE
previous I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
did O
not O
care O
to O
come O
near O


her O
dear O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O
She O
clipped O
the O
bouquet O
which O
George B-PERSON
had O
brought O
her O
, O
and O


gave O
fresh O
water O
to O
the O
flowers O
, O
and O
read O
over O
the O
letter O
which O
he O
had O
sent O


her O
. O
 O
Poor O
wretch O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
twirling O
round O
the O
little O
bit O
of O
paper O
in O
her O


fingers O
, O
 O
how O
I O
could O
crush O
her O
with O
this!—and O
it O
is O
for O
a O
thing O
like O
this O


that O
she O
must O
break O
her O
heart O
, O
forsooth O
— O
for O
a O
man O
who O
is O
stupid O
— O
a O


coxcomb O
— O
and O
who O
does O
not O
care O
for O
her O
. O
My O
poor O
good O
Rawdon B-PERSON
is O
worth O
ten B-CARDINAL
of O


this O
creature O
. O
 O
And O
then O
she O
fell O
to O
thinking O
what O
she O
should O
do O
if O
— O
if O


anything O
happened O
to O
poor O
good O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
and O
what O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
luck O
it O
was O


that O
he O
had O
left O
his O
horses O
behind O
. O


In O
the O
course O
of O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
too O
, O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
who O
saw O
not O
without O
anger O
the O


Bareacres B-PERSON
party O
drive O
off O
, O
bethought O
her O
of O
the O
precaution O
which O
the O


Countess B-PERSON
had O
taken O
, O
and O
did O
a O
little O
needlework O
for O
her O
own O
advantage O
; O
she O


stitched O
away O
the O
major O
part O
of O
her O
trinkets O
, O
bills O
and O
bank O
- O
notes O
about O
her O


person O
, O
and O
so O
prepared O
, O
was O
ready O
for O
any O
event O
— O
to O
fly O
if O
she O
thought O
fit O
, O


or O
to O
stay O
and O
welcome O
the O
conqueror O
, O
were O
he O
Englishman O
or O
Frenchman B-NORP
. O
And O
I O


am O
not O
sure O
that O
she O
did O
not O
dream O
that O
night B-TIME
of O
becoming O
a O
duchess O
and O


Madame O
la O
Maréchale O
, O
while O
Rawdon B-PERSON
wrapped O
in O
his O
cloak O
, O
and O
making O
his O


bivouac O
under O
the O
rain O
at O
Mount B-LOC
Saint I-LOC
John I-LOC
, O
was O
thinking O
, O
with O
all O
the O
force O


of O
his O
heart O
, O
about O
the O
little O
wife O
whom O
he O
had O
left O
behind O
him O
. O


The B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
was O
a O
Sunday B-DATE
. O
And O
Mrs. O
Major O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O


seeing O
both O
her O
patients O
refreshed O
in O
health O
and O
spirits O
by O
some O
rest O
which O


they O
had O
taken O
during O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O
She O
herself O
had O
slept O
on O
a O
great O
chair O
in O


Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
room O
, O
ready O
to O
wait O
upon O
her O
poor O
friend O
or O
the O
ensign O
, O
should O


either O
need O
her O
nursing O
. O
When O
morning B-TIME
came O
, O
this O
robust O
woman O
went O
back O
to O


the O
house O
where O
she O
and O
her O
Major O
had O
their O
billet O
; O
and O
here O
performed O
an O


elaborate O
and O
splendid O
toilette O
, O
befitting O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O
And O
it O
is O
very O
possible O


that O
whilst O
alone O
in O
that O
chamber O
, O
which O
her O
husband O
had O
inhabited O
, O
and O


where O
his O
cap O
still O
lay O
on O
the O
pillow O
, O
and O
his O
cane O
stood O
in O
the O
corner O
, O
one B-CARDINAL


prayer O
at O
least O
was O
sent O
up O
to O
Heaven O
for O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
brave O
soldier O
, O


Michael B-PERSON
O’Dowd I-PERSON
. O


When O
she O
returned O
she O
brought O
her O
prayer O
- O
book O
with O
her O
, O
and O
her O
uncle O
the O


Dean B-PERSON
’s O
famous O
book O
of O
sermons O
, O
out O
of O
which O
she O
never O
failed O
to O
read O
every O


Sabbath B-PERSON
; O
not O
understanding O
all O
, O
haply O
, O
not O
pronouncing O
many O
of O
the O
words O


aright O
, O
which O
were O
long O
and O
abstruse O
— O
for O
the O
Dean B-PERSON
was O
a O
learned O
man O
, O
and O


loved O
long O
Latin B-NORP
words O
— O
but O
with O
great O
gravity O
, O
vast O
emphasis O
, O
and O
with O


tolerable O
corrections O
in O
the O
main O
. O
How O
often O
has O
my O
Mick B-PERSON
listened O
to O
these O


sermons O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
and O
me O
reading O
in O
the O
cabin O
of O
a O
calm O
! O
She O
proposed O
to O


resume O
this O
exercise O
on O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
with O
Amelia B-PERSON
and O
the O
wounded O
ensign O


for O
a O
congregation O
. O
The O
same O
service O
was O
read O
on O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL


churches O
at O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
hour I-TIME
; O
and O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
British B-NORP
men O
and O
women O
, O
on O
their O


knees O
, O
implored O
protection O
of O
the O
Father O
of O
all O
. O


They O
did O
not O
hear O
the O
noise O
which O
disturbed O
our O
little O
congregation O
at O


Brussels B-GPE
. O
Much O
louder O
than O
that O
which O
had O
interrupted O
them O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE


previously O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
was O
reading O
the O
service O
in O
her O
best O
voice O
, O
the O


cannon O
of O
Waterloo B-GPE
began O
to O
roar O
. O


When O
Jos B-PERSON
heard O
that O
dreadful O
sound O
, O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
he O
would O
bear O


this O
perpetual O
recurrence O
of O
terrors O
no O
longer O
, O
and O
would O
fly O
at O
once O
. O
He O


rushed O
into O
the O
sick O
man O
’s O
room O
, O
where O
our O
three B-CARDINAL
friends O
had O
paused O
in O
their O


prayers O
, O
and O
further O
interrupted O
them O
by O
a O
passionate O
appeal O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O


 O
I O
ca O
n’t O
stand O
it O
any O
more O
, O
Emmy B-PERSON
, O
 O
he O
said O
; O
 O
I O
wo O

it O

come O
with O
me O
. O
I O

you O

and O
ride O
behind O
Isidor B-PERSON
. O
 O


 O
God O
forgive O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
but O
you O
are O
no O
better O
than O
a O
coward O
, O
 O
Mrs. O


O’Dowd B-PERSON
said O
, O
laying O
down O
the O
book O
. O


 O
I O
say O
come O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
 O
the O
civilian O
went O
on O
; O
 O
never O

what O
she O
says O

why O


are O
we O
to O
stop O
here O
and O
be O
butchered O
by O
the O
Frenchmen B-NORP
? O
 O


 O
You O
forget O
the O

th O
, O
my O
boy O

 O
said O
the O
little O
Stubble B-PRODUCT

the O

from O
his O

you O

Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON

 O


 O
No O
, O
my O
dear O

 O

she O
, O
going O
up O
and O
kissing O
the O
boy O
. O
 O
No O
harm O


shall O
come O
to O
you O
while O

I O

stand O
by O

I O
do O
n’t O
budge O

I O
get O
the O


word O
from O
Mick B-PERSON
. O
A O
pretty O
figure O
I O
’d O
be O

would O

I O
, O
stuck O
behind O
that O
chap O


on O
a B-CARDINAL
pillion I-CARDINAL
? O
 O


This O
image O
caused O
the O
young O
patient O
to O
burst O
out O
laughing O
in O
his O
bed O
, O
and O


even O
made O
Amelia B-PERSON
smile O
. O
 O
I O
do O
n’t O
ask O
her O
, O
 O
Jos B-PERSON
shouted O
out—I O
do O
n’t O
ask O


that O
— O
that O
Irishwoman B-NORP
, O
but O
you O
Amelia B-PERSON
; O
once O
for O
all O
, O
will O
you O
come O
? O
 O


 O
Without O
my O
husband O
, O
Joseph B-PERSON
? O
 O
Amelia B-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
wonder O
, O
and O
gave O


her O
hand O
to O
the O
Major O
’s O
wife O
. O
Jos B-PERSON
’s O
patience O
was O
exhausted O
. O


 O
Good O
- O
bye O
, O
then O
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
shaking O
his O
fist O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
and O
slamming O
the O


door O
by O
which O
he O
retreated O
. O
And O
this O
time O
he O
really O
gave O
his O
order O
for O


march O
: O
and O
mounted O
in O
the O
courtyard O
. O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
heard O
the O
clattering O
hoofs O


of O
the O
horses O
as O
they O
issued O
from O
the O
gate O
; O
and O
looking O
on O
, O
made O
many O


scornful O
remarks O
on O
poor O
Joseph B-PERSON
as O
he O
rode O
down O
the O
street O
with O
Isidor B-PERSON
after O


him O
in O
the O
laced O
cap O
. O
The O
horses O
, O
which O
had O
not O
been O
exercised O
for O
some B-DATE


days I-DATE
, O
were O
lively O
, O
and O
sprang O
about O
the O
street O
. O
Joe B-PERSON
, O
a O
clumsy O
and O
timid O


horseman O
, O
did O
not O
look O
to O
advantage O
in O
the O
saddle O
. O
 O
Look O
at O
him O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON


dear O
, O
driving O
into O
the O
parlour O
window O
. O
Such O
a O
bull O
in O
a O
chinashop B-GPE

I O


never O
saw O
. O
 O
And O
presently O
the O
pair O
of O
riders O
disappeared O
at O
a O
canter O
down O


the O
street O
leading O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Ghent B-GPE
road O
, O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
pursuing O


them O
with O
a O
fire O
of O
sarcasm O
so O
long O
as O
they O
were O
in O
sight O
. O


All O
that O
day O
from O
morning B-TIME
until O
past O
sunset O

the O
cannon O
never O
ceased O
to O


roar O

It O
was O
dark O
when O
the O
cannonading O
stopped O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
. O


All O
of O
us O
have O
read O
of O
what O
occurred O
during O
that O
interval O

The O
tale O
is O
in O


every O
Englishman O

and O
you O
and O
I O
, O
who O
were O
children O
when O
the O
great O


battle O
was O
won O

lost O

are O
never O
tired O
of O
hearing O
the O
recounting O
the O


history O
of O
that O
famous O
action O

Its O
remembrance O
rankles O
still O
in O

no O

what O
you O

only O
younger O

a O

prettier O

cleverer O

Were O
you O
an O
accomplice O
of O
that O

wretch O

I O


wonder O

of O
whose O
vile O

he O
became O
a O

of O

you O
used O

Yes O

I O

you O
were O

you O

yourself O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
: O
and O
you O
will O
have O
the O


goodness O
to O
write O

Mr. O

say O
that O
I O
desire O

 O
Miss O

was O
now O
in O
the O
habit O

writing O
to O
Mr. O
Waxy B-PERSON
her O


solicitor O
almost B-DATE
every I-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
for O
her O
arrangements O

her O


property O

all O
revoked O

and O
her O
perplexity O
was O
great O
as O
to O
the O
future O


disposition O
of O
her O
money O

The O
spinster O
had O
, O
however O
, O
rallied O
considerably O
; O
as O
was O
proved O
by O
the O


increased O
vigour O
and O
frequency O
of O
her O
sarcasms O
upon O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
all O
which O


attacks O
the O
poor O
companion O
bore O
with O
meekness O
, O
with O
cowardice O
, O
with O
a O


resignation O
that O
was O
half B-CARDINAL
generous O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
hypocritical O
— O
with O
the O
slavish O


submission O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
that O
women O
of O
her O
disposition O
and O
station O
are O


compelled O
to O
show O
. O
Who O
has O
not O
seen O
how O
women O
bully O
women O
? O
What O
tortures O


have O
men O
to O
endure O
, O
comparable O
to O
those O
daily O
repeated O
shafts O
of O
scorn O
and O


cruelty O
with O
which O
poor O
women O
are O
riddled O
by O
the O
tyrants O
of O
their O
sex O
? O
Poor O


victims O
! O
But O
we O
are O
starting O
from O
our O
proposition O
, O
which O
is O
, O
that O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
was O
always O
particularly O
annoying O
and O
savage O
when O
she O
was O
rallying O


from O
illness O
— O
as O
they O
say O
wounds O
tingle O
most O
when O
they O
are O
about O
to O
heal O
. O


While O
thus O
approaching O
, O
as O
all O
hoped O
, O
to O
convalescence O
, O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O
the O


only O
victim O
admitted O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
invalid O
; O
yet O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O


relatives O
afar O
off O
did O
not O
forget O
their O
beloved O
kinswoman O
, O
and O
by O
a O
number O


of O
tokens O
, O
presents O
, O
and O
kind O
affectionate O
messages O
, O
strove O
to O
keep O


themselves O
alive O
in O
her O
recollection O
. O


In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
let O
us O
mention O
her O
nephew O
, O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
. O
A B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE


after O
the O
famous O
fight O
of O
Waterloo B-GPE
, O
and O
after O
the O

Gazette B-ORG

had O
made O


known O
to O
her O
the O
promotion O
and O
gallantry O
of O
that O
distinguished O
officer O
, O
the O


Dieppe B-GPE
packet O
brought O
over O
to O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
at O
Brighton B-GPE
, O
a O
box O
containing O


presents O
, O
and O
a O
dutiful O
letter O
, O
from O
the O
Colonel O
her O
nephew O
. O
In O
the O
box O
were O


a O
pair O
of O
French B-NORP
epaulets O
, O
a O
Cross B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Legion I-ORG
of I-ORG
Honour I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
hilt O
of O


a O
sword O
— O
relics O
from O
the O
field O
of O
battle O
: O
and O
the O
letter O
described O
with O
a O


good O
deal O
of O
humour O
how O
the O
latter O
belonged O
to O
a O
commanding O
- O
officer O
of O
the O


Guard O
, O
who O
having O
sworn O
that O
 O
the O
Guard B-ORG
died O
, O
but O
never O
surrendered O
, O
 O
was O


taken O
prisoner O
the B-TIME
next I-TIME
minute I-TIME
by O
a O
private O
soldier O
, O
who O
broke O
the O


Frenchman B-PERSON
’s O
sword O
with O
the O
butt O
of O
his O
musket O
, O
when O
Rawdon B-PERSON
made O
himself O


master O
of O
the O
shattered O
weapon O
. O
As O
for O
the O
cross O
and O
epaulets O
, O
they O
came O


from O
a O
Colonel O
of O
French B-NORP
cavalry O
, O
who O
had O
fallen O
under O
the O
aide O
- O
de O
- O
camp O
’s O


arm O
in O
the O
battle O
: O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
did O
not O
know O
what O
better O
to O
do O
with O


the O
spoils O
than O
to O
send O
them O
to O
his O
kindest O
and O
most O
affectionate O
old O


friend O
. O
Should O
he O
continue O
to O
write O
to O
her O
from O
Paris B-GPE
, O
whither O
the O
army O
was O


marching O
? O
He O
might O
be O
able O
to O
give O
her O
interesting O
news O
from O
that O
capital O
, O


and O
of O
some O
of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
old O
friends O
of O
the O
emigration O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
had O


shown O
so O
much O
kindness O
during O
their O
distress O
. O


The O
spinster O
caused O
Briggs B-PERSON
to O
write O
back O
to O
the O
Colonel O
a O
gracious O
and O


complimentary O
letter O
, O
encouraging O
him O
to O
continue O
his O
correspondence O
. O
His O


first B-ORDINAL
letter O
was O
so O
excessively O
lively O
and O
amusing O
that O
she O
should O
look O
with O


pleasure O
for O
its O
successors.—Of O
course O
, O
I O
know O
, O
 O
she O
explained O
to O
Miss O


Briggs B-PERSON
, O
 O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
could O
not O
write O
such O
a O
good O
letter O
any O
more O
than O
you O


could O
, O
my O
poor O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
that O
clever O
little O
wretch O
of O
a O


Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
who O
dictates O
every O
word O
to O
him O
; O
but O
that O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
my O
nephew O


should O
not O
amuse O
me O
; O
and O
so O
I O
wish O
to O
let O
him O
understand O
that O
I O
am O
in O
high O


good O
- O
humour O
. O
 O


I O
wonder O
whether O
she O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
not O
only O
Becky B-PERSON
who O
wrote O
the O
letters O
, O


but O
that O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
actually O
took O
and O
sent O
home O
the O
trophies O
— O
which O
she O


bought O
for O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
francs I-MONEY
, O
from O
one O
of O
the O
innumerable O

who O
immediately O


began O

Miss O

gracious O
reply O


greatly O
encouraged O
our O
young O
friends O

Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
his O
lady O

who O
hoped O
for O
the O


best O
from O
their O
aunt O

evidently O
pacified O
humour O
: O
and O
they O
took O
care O
to O


entertain O
her O
with O
many O
delightful O
letters O
from O
Paris B-GPE
, O
whither O
, O
as O
Rawdon B-PERSON


said O
, O
they O
had O
the O
good O
luck O
to O
go O
in O
the O

, O
the O

communications O
were O
by O
no O

so O
gracious O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
, O
that O
brisk O
, O
managing O
, O
lively O
, O
imperious O
woman O
, O


had O
committed O
the O
most O
fatal O
of O
all O
errors O
with O
regard O
to O
her O
sister O
- O
in O

law O
. O


She O
had O
not O
merely O
oppressed O
her O
and O
her O
household O
— O
she O
had O
bored O
Miss O


Crawley B-PERSON
; O
and O
if O
poor O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
had O
been O
a O
woman O
of O
any O
spirit O
, O
she O
might O


have O
been O
made O
happy O
by O
the O
commission O
which O
her O
principal O
gave O
her O
to O
write O


a O
letter O
to O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
, O
saying O
that O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON

health O
was O
greatly O


improved O
since O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
had O
left O
her O

begging O
the O

on O
no O

to O
put O
herself O
to O
trouble O
, O
or O
quit O
her O
family O
for O
Miss O

This O


triumph O
over O
a O
lady O
who O
had O
been O
very O
haughty O
and O
cruel O
in O
her O
behaviour O
to O


Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
would O
have O
rejoiced O
most O
women O
; O
but O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O
a O


woman O
of O
no O
spirit O
at O
all O
, O
and O
the O
moment O
her O
enemy O
was O
discomfited O
, O
she O


began O
to O
feel O
compassion O
in O
her O
favour O
. O


 O
How O
silly O
I O
was O
, O
 O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
thought O
, O
and O
with O
reason O
, O
 O
ever O
to O
hint O
that O
I O


was O
coming O

as O
I O
did O

in O
that O
foolish O
letter O

 O


Why O

indeed O
? O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
Mrs. O

having O
the O
game O
in O
her O

had O


really O
played O
her O

She O

Miss O

household O
utterly O

utterly O

a O


favourable O
opportunity O
for O

came O

She O

her O

however O
, O


considered O
that O
she O
had O
been O
the O
victim O
of O
horrible O
selfishness O

treason O
, O


and O
that O
her O
sacrifices O
in O
Miss O

had O
met O
with O
the O
most O


savage O
ingratitude O

the O
honourable O
mention O

of O


his O

filled O
the O

with O


alarm O

Would O
his O

towards O
him O
now O
that O
he O

Lieutenant O

The O

the O


vanity O

the O

The O

The O

Sir O

, O
that O
his O

It O
was O
indeed O
a O
rude O
burthen O
for O
Mr. O

bear O

His O
eloquence O


was O
palsied O
at O
the O
missionary O

the O

who O
were O
likewise O
in O

some O
gipsy O

How O

the O

speech O
. O
And O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
daughters O
of O


the O
house O
of O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-PERSON
would O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
run O

wild O


( O
for O
Sir O

swore O
that O
no O

, O
had O
not O
Mr. O

the O

Meanwhile O

whatever O

there O
might O
be O


between O
them O
all O
, O
Miss O

Thus O
Mrs. O

sent O


guinea O

a O

the O

The O

besides O
, O
he O
had O
an O

at O
Brighton B-GPE
in O
the O

of O
the O
Lady O

Sheepshanks I-PERSON

Her O

that O


strong O

woman O
so O
favourably O
known O
in O
the O

A O
few O
words O
ought O
to O
be O
said O
regarding O
her O

her O
noble O

who O

the O
Southdown B-LOC

, O
Clement B-PERSON
William I-PERSON

fourth O
Earl O

be O
told O

that O
his O

into O
Parliament B-ORG
( O
as O
Lord O
Wolsey B-PERSON

under O
the O

of O
Mr. O
Wilberforce B-PERSON

for O
a O
time O
was O
a O
credit O
to O
his O
political O

, O
and O
decidedly O
a O
serious O


young O
man O

But O
words O
can O
not O
describe O
the O
feelings O
of O
his O
admirable O
mother O

when O
she O
learned O
, O
very O
shortly O
after O
her O
noble O

demise O
, O
that O
her O


son O

that O
he O
drove O
four B-CARDINAL

that O

The O

her O
love O
for O
the O

occupied O
almost O
all O
her O
feelings O

It O
is O
to O
her O
, O
I O
believe O

we O
owe O
that O


beautiful O
poem O

In O

of O
his O

was O
quite O

with O
soft O


dove O

separated O

Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON


treated O
her O
to O
a O
profound O

such O
as O

used O
to O
H.H. B-PERSON
the O


Duchess B-ORG

when O

with O
a O
dedication O
from O
the O


poetess O
to O
his O

and O
he O
brought O
the O
volume O
with O
him O
to O


Brighton B-PERSON

reading O
it O
in O
the O
Southampton B-GPE
coach O
and O
marking O
it O
with O
his O
own O


pencil O
, O
before O
he O
presented O
it O
to O
the O
gentle O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON

It O
was O
he O
, O
too O
, O
who O
laid O
before O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown I-PERSON
the O
great O
advantages O

might O
occur O
from O
an O
intimacy O
between O
her O

Miss B-PERSON
Crawley,—advantages I-PERSON


both O
worldly O
and O
spiritual O
, O
he O
said O
: O
for O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O
now O
quite O
alone O
; O


the O
monstrous O
dissipation O
and O
alliance O
of O
his O
brother O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
estranged O


her O
affections O
from O
that O
reprobate O
young O
man O
; O
the O
greedy O
tyranny O
and O
avarice O


of O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
had O
caused O
the O
old O
lady O
to O
revolt O
against O
the O


exorbitant O
pretensions O
of O
that O
part O
of O
the O
family O

though O
he O
himself O
had O


held O
off O
all O
his O
life O
from O
cultivating O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
friendship O
, O
with O


perhaps O
an O
improper O
pride O
, O
he O
thought O
now O
that O
every O
becoming O
means O
should O


be O
taken O
, O
both O
to O
save O
her O
soul O
from O
perdition O

I O

her O

how O

how O

accustomed O

 O


 O
Can O

rising O
with O
six B-CARDINAL


little O
books O
already O
in O

 O
If O
you O
begin O
abruptly O
, O
you O
will O
frighten O
her O
altogether O
. O
I O
know O
my O
aunt O
’s O


worldly O
nature O
so O
well O
as O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
any O
abrupt O
attempt O
at O
conversion O


will O
be O
the O
very O
worst O
means O
that O
can O
be O
employed O
for O
the O
welfare O
of O
that O


unfortunate O
lady O
. O
You O
will O
only O
frighten O
and O
annoy O
her O
. O
She O
will O
very O
likely O


fling O
the O
books O
away O
, O
and O
refuse O
all O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
givers O
. O
 O


 O
You O
are O
as O

continued O

in O

, O
 O
how O
fatal O
a O

may O
be O

any O
hopes O
which O
we O

think O
of O

her O
highly O

I O
know O
that O
she O

Colonel O

a O
great O
stroke O

Pitt B-PERSON

suddenly O
took O
up O
the O
cudgels O
in O
favour O
of O


the O
man O
of O

He O
described O
the O
First B-ORDINAL
Consul O
as O
he O
saw O
him O
at O
Paris B-GPE
at O


the O
peace O
of O
Amiens B-GPE

when O
he O

Pitt B-PERSON

had O
the O
gratification O
of O
making O


the O
acquaintance O
of O
the O
great O

good O
Mr. O
Fox B-PERSON
, O
a O
statesman O
whom O
, O
however O


much O
he O
might O
differ O
with O
him O

it O
was O
impossible O

to O
admire O
fervently O

a O


statesman O
who O
had O
always O
had O
the O
highest O
opinion O
of O
the O
Emperor O
Napoleon O

And O
he O
spoke O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
strongest O
indignation O
of O
the O
faithless O
conduct O


of O
the O
allies O
towards O
this O
dethroned O

who O
, O
after O
giving O
himself O


generously O
up O
to O
their O
mercy O

was O
consigned O
to O
an O
ignoble O

cruel O


banishment O

while O
a O
bigoted O

rabble O
was O
tyrannising O
over O
France B-GPE
in O
his O


stead O

This O
orthodox O
horror O
of O
Romish B-NORP
superstition O
saved O
Pitt B-PERSON

in O
Lady O


Southdown B-PERSON

opinion O
, O
whilst O
his O
admiration O
for O
Fox B-ORG

Napoleon B-PERSON
raised O
him O


immeasurably O
in O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
eyes O
. O
Her O
friendship O
with O
that O
defunct O


British B-NORP
statesman O
was O
mentioned O
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
introduced O
her O
in O
this O


history O
. O
A O
true O
Whig B-NORP
, O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
been O
in O
opposition O
all O
through O
the O


war O
, O
and O
though O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
downfall O
of O
the O
Emperor O
did O
not O
very O
much O


agitate O
the O
old O
lady O
, O
or O
his O
ill O
- O
treatment O
tend O
to O
shorten O
her O
life O
or O


natural O
rest O
, O
yet O
Pitt B-PERSON
spoke O
to O
her O
heart O
when O
he O
lauded O
both O
her O
idols O
; O
and O


by O
that O
single O
speech O
made O
immense O
progress O
in O
her O
favour O
. O


 O
And O
what O
do O
you O
think O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
 O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
said O
to O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
for O


whom O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
liking O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
sight O
, O
as O
she O
always O
did O
for O
pretty O
and O


modest O
young O
people O
; O
though O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
her O
affections O
cooled O
as O


rapidly O
as O
they O
rose O
. O


Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
blushed O
very O
much O
, O
and O
said O
 O
that O
she O
did O
not O
understand O


politics O
, O
which O
she O
left O
to O
wiser O
heads O
than O
hers O
; O
but O
though O
Mamma B-PERSON
was O
, O
no O


doubt O
, O
correct O
, O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
spoken O
beautifully O
. O
 O
And O
when O
the O
ladies O


were O
retiring O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
their O
visit O
, O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
hoped O
 O
Lady O


Southdown O
would O
be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
send O
her O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
sometimes O
, O
if O
she O
could O


be O
spared O
to O
come O
down O
and O
console O
a O
poor O
sick O
lonely O
old O
woman O
. O
 O
This O


promise O
was O
graciously O
accorded O
, O
and O
they O
separated O
upon O
great O
terms O
of O


amity O
. O


 O
Do O
n’t O
let O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown I-PERSON
come O
again O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
the O
old O
lady O
. O
 O
She O
is O


stupid O
and O
pompous O
, O
like O
all O
your O
mother O
’s O
family O
, O
whom O
I O
never O
could O


endure O
. O
But O
bring O
that O
nice O
good O
- O
natured O
little O
Jane B-PERSON
as O
often O
as O
ever O
you O


please O
. O
 O
Pitt B-PERSON
promised O
that O
he O
would O
do O
so O
. O
He O
did O
not O
tell O
the O
Countess O
of O


Southdown B-GPE
what O
opinion O
his O
aunt O
had O
formed O
of O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
who O
, O
on O
the O


contrary O
, O
thought O
that O
she O
had O
made O
a O
most O
delightful O
and O
majestic O


impression O
on O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
. O


And O
so O
, O
nothing O
loth O
to O
comfort O
a O
sick O
lady O
, O
and O
perhaps O
not O
sorry O
in O
heart O


to O
be O
freed O
now O
and O
again O
from O
the O
dreary O
spouting O
of O
the O
Reverend O


Bartholomew B-PERSON
Irons I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
serious O
toadies O
who O
gathered O
round O
the O
footstool O


of O
the O
pompous O
Countess O
, O
her O
mamma O
, O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
became O
a O
pretty O
constant O


visitor O
to O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
accompanied O
her O
in O
her O
drives O
, O
and O
solaced O
many O
of O


her O
evenings O
. O
She O
was O
so O
naturally O
good O
and O
soft O
, O
that O
even O
Firkin B-PERSON
was O
not O


jealous O
of O
her O
; O
and O
the O
gentle O
Briggs B-PERSON
thought O
her O
friend O
was O
less O
cruel O
to O


her O
, O
when O
kind O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
was O
by O
. O
Towards O
her O
Ladyship O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
manners O


were O
charming O
. O
The O
old O
spinster B-PERSON
told O
her O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
anecdotes O
about O
her O


youth O
, O
talking O
to O
her O
in O
a O
very O
different O
strain O
from O
that O
in O
which O
she O
had O


been O
accustomed O
to O
converse O
with O
the O
godless O
little O
Rebecca B-PERSON
; O
for O
there O
was O


that O
in O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
’s O
innocence O
which O
rendered O
light O
talking O
impertinence O


before O
her O
, O
and O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
of O
a O
gentlewoman O
to O
offend O
such O


purity O
. O
The O
young O
lady O
herself O
had O
never O
received O
kindness O
except O
from O
this O


old O
spinster O
, O
and O
her O
brother O
and O
father O
: O
and O
she O
repaid O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O


engoûment O

by O
artless O
sweetness O
and O
friendship O
. O


In O
the O
autumn O
evenings O
( O
when O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
flaunting O
at O

the O
gayest O


among O

ah O

where O

she O

) O
Lady O

would O
be O
sitting O
in O
Miss O

drawing O

singing O
sweetly O
to O
her O
, O
in O
the O
twilight O

her O
little O
simple O

, O


while O
the O
sun O
was O
setting O
and O
the O
sea O
was O
roaring O
on O
the O
beach O
. O
The O
old O


spinster B-PERSON
used O
to O
wake O
up O
when O
these O
ditties O
ceased O
, O
and O
ask O
for O
more O
. O
As O
for O


Briggs B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
quantity O
of O
tears O
of O
happiness O
which O
she O
now O
shed O
as O

pretended O

looked O
out O
at O
the O
splendid O

darkling O
before O

the O
lamps O
of O
heaven O
beginning O

who O
, O
I O


say O
, O
can O
measure O
the O
happiness O
and O
sensibility O
of O
Briggs B-PERSON
? O


Pitt B-PERSON
meanwhile O
in O
the O
dining O

with O
a O
pamphlet O
on O
the O
Corn O
Laws O
or O
a O


Missionary B-ORG

by O
his O

took O
that O
kind O
of O
recreation O
which O
suits O


romantic O

unromantic O
men O
after O
dinner O
. O
He O
sipped O
Madeira B-LOC

built O

in O
the O

: O
thought O
himself O
a O
fine O
fellow O
: O
felt O
himself O
much O
more O
in O

with O

he O
had O
been O
any O

these B-DATE
seven I-DATE

had O
lasted O
without O

on O

part O

and O
slept O
a O
good O
deal O
. O


When O
the O
time O
for O
coffee O
came O
, O
Mr. O

used O
to O
enter O
in O
a O
noisy O
manner O

and O
summon O
Squire B-PERSON

 O
Miss O

said O
one B-TIME
night I-TIME
when O
this O
functionary O
made O
his O
appearance O
with O
the O


candles O
and O
the O
coffee O
. O
 O
Poor O

can O
no O
more O

she O
is O
so O


stupid O
 O
( O
the O
spinster O
always O
took O
an O
opportunity O
of O
abusing O

before O


the O
servants O

; O
 O
and O
I O
think O
I O
should O
sleep O
better O
if O

had O
my O

 O


At O
this O
Lady O

blushed O

down O
to O
the O


ends O

her O

found O

James B-PERSON

himself O

, O
either O

without O
gloves O

 O
And O


that O
’s O
a O
fair O
offer O
, O
my O
buck O
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
loud O
laugh O
, O
slapping O
Pitt B-PERSON
on O


the O
shoulder O
, O
 O
and O
my O
father O
told O
me O
to O
make O
it O
too O
, O
and O
he O
’ll O
go O
halves O
in O


the O
bet O
, O
ha O

! O
 O
So O
saying O
, O
the O
engaging O
youth O
nodded O
knowingly O
at O
poor O


Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
and O
pointed O
his O
thumb O
over O
his O
shoulder O
at O
Pitt B-ORG
Crawley I-ORG
in O
a O


jocular O
and O
exulting O
manner O
. O


Pitt B-PERSON
was O
not O
pleased O
altogether O
perhaps O
, O
but O
still O
not O
unhappy O
in O
the O
main O
. O


Poor O
Jim B-PERSON
had O
his O
laugh O
out O
: O
and O
staggered O
across O
the O
room O
with O
his O
aunt O
’s O


candle O
, O
when O
the O
old O
lady O
moved O
to O
retire O
, O
and O
offered O
to O
salute O
her O
with O


the O
blandest O
tipsy O
smile O
: O
and O
he O
took O
his O
own O
leave O
and O
went O
upstairs O
to O
his O


bed O
- O
room O
perfectly O
satisfied O
with O
himself O
, O
and O
with O
a O
pleased O
notion O
that O


his O
aunt O
’s O
money O
would O
be O
left O
to O
him O
in O
preference O
to O
his O
father O
and O
all O


the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
. O


Once O
up O
in O
the O
bed O
- O
room O
, O
one O
would O
have O
thought O
he O
could O
not O
make O
matters O


worse O
; O
and O
yet O
this O
unlucky O
boy O
did O
. O
The O
moon O
was O
shining O
very O
pleasantly O


out O
on O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
Jim B-PERSON
, O
attracted O
to O
the O
window O
by O
the O
romantic O
appearance O


of O
the O
ocean O
and O
the O
heavens O
, O
thought O
he O
would O
further O
enjoy O
them O
while O


smoking O
. O
Nobody O
would O
smell O
the O
tobacco O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
if O
he O
cunningly O
opened O


the O
window O
and O
kept O
his O
head O
and O
pipe O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
. O
This O
he O
did O
: O
but O


being O
in O
an O
excited O
state O
, O
poor O
Jim B-PERSON
had O
forgotten O
that O
his O
door O
was O
open O
all O


this O
time O
, O
so O
that O
the O
breeze O
blowing O
inwards O
and O
a O
fine O
thorough O
draught O


being O
established O
, O
the O
clouds O
of O
tobacco O
were O
carried O
downstairs O
, O
and O


arrived O
with O
quite O
undiminished O
fragrance O
to O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
and O
Miss O


Briggs B-PERSON
. O


The O
pipe O
of O
tobacco O
finished O
the O
business O
: O
and O
the O
Bute O
- O
Crawleys O
never O
knew O


how O
many B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
it O
cost O
them O
. O
Firkin B-PERSON
rushed O
downstairs O
to O

was O

The O
dreadful O
secret O
was O
told O
to O
him O
by O
Firkin B-PERSON
with O
so O


frightened O
a O
look O
, O
that O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
moment O
Mr. O
Bowls B-PERSON
and O
his O
young O
man O


thought O
that O
robbers O
were O
in O
the O
house O
; O
the O
legs O
of O
whom O
had O
probably O
been O


discovered O
by O
the O

under O
Miss O

When O

 O


in O
a O

Mr. O

 O

said O
in O
a O

out O

with O
a O
frantic O

and O


thought O
the O

an O
excellent O

But O
his O

were O
very O
different O
in O
the B-TIME

The O
news O
which O
that O
famous O

brought O
to O
the O
Osbornes B-ORG
gave O
a O


dreadful O
shock O
to O
the O

its O
chief O
. O
The O

indulged O
unrestrained O


in O
their O
grief O

The O
gloom O
- O
stricken O
old O
father O
was O
still O
more O
borne O
down O
by O


his O
fate O

sorrow O
. O
He O
strove O
to O
think O
that O
a O
judgment O
was O
on O
the O
boy O
for O


his O
disobedience O
. O
He O
dread O
not O
own O
that O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
sentence O


frightened O
him O
, O
and O
that O
its O
fulfilment O
had O
come O
too O
soon O
upon O
his O
curses O

Sometimes O
a O
shuddering O
terror O
struck O
him O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
the O
author O
of O


the O
doom O
which O
he O
had O
called O
down O
on O
his O
son O

There O
was O
a O
chance O

of O


reconciliation O

The O
boy O

or O
he O
might O
have O
come O
back O


and O
said O
, O
Father O
I O
have O
sinned O
. O
But O
there O
was O
no O
hope O
now O
. O
He O
stood O
on O
the O


other O
side O
of O
the O
gulf B-LOC
impassable O
, O
haunting O
his O
parent O
with O
sad O
eyes O

He O


remembered O
them O
once O
before O
so O
in O
a O
fever O
, O
when O
every O
one O
thought O
the O
lad O


was O
dying O

and O
he O
lay O
on O
his O
bed O
speechless O
, O
and O
gazing O
with O
a O
dreadful O


gloom O

Good O
God O
! O
how O
the O
father O
clung O
to O
the O
doctor O
then O
; O
and O
with O
what O
a O


sickening O
anxiety O
he O
followed O
him O
: O
what O
a O
weight O
of O
grief O
was O
off O
his O
mind O


when O
, O
after O
the O
crisis O
of O
the O
fever O
, O
the O
lad O
recovered O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
his O


father O
once O
more O
with O
eyes O
that O
recognised O
him O
. O
But O
now O
there O
was O
no O
help O
or O


cure O
, O
or O
chance O
of O
reconcilement O
; O
above O
all O
, O
there O
were O
no O
humble O
words O
to O


soothe O
vanity O
outraged O
and O
furious O
, O
or O
bring O
to O
its O
natural O
flow O
the O


poisoned O
, O
angry O
blood O

And O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
which O
pang O
it O
was O
that O
tore O
the O


proud O
father O

heart O
most O
keenly O
— O
that O
his O
son O
should O
have O
gone O
out O
of O
the O


reach O
of O
his O
forgiveness O
, O
or O
that O
the O
apology O
which O
his O
own O

expected O


should O
have O
escaped O
him O
. O


Whatever O
his O
sensations O
might O
have O
been O
, O
however O
, O
the O
stern O
old O
man O
would O


have O
no O
confidant O
. O
He O
never O
mentioned O
his O
son O

name O
to O
his O
daughters O
; O
but O


ordered O
the O
elder O
to O
place O
all O
the O
females O

desired O
that O

All O

before O
the O

The O
poor O

did O
not O

He O
had O
been O
too O
proud O
to O


acknowledge O
the O

felt O

He O
only O
said O
, O
that O
on O
the O


eve O

, O
he O
wished O
to O
bid O
his O

solemnly O

the O

— O
it O
might O
be O
for O
the O
child O
— O
whom O
he O
left O


behind O
him O

He O
owned O
with O
contrition O
that O
his O

his O


extravagance O
had O
already O
wasted O
a O

He O
thanked O
his O

he O

His O

His O

an O


English B-LANGUAGE
gentleman O

a O

there O
can O

our O

how O
selfish O
our O

? O
Old O
Osborne B-PERSON
did O
not O
speculate O
much O
upon O
the O

nature O

how O
his O
instinct O

selfishness O
were O
combating O


together O

He O
firmly O
believed O
that O
everything O
he O
did O
was O
right O

that O
he O
ought O


on O
all O
occasions O
to O
have O
his O
own O
way O
— O
and O
like O
the O
sting O
of O
a O
wasp O
or O
serpent O


his O
hatred O
rushed O
out O
armed O
and O
poisonous O
against O
anything O
like O
opposition O
. O


He O
was O
proud O
of O
his O
hatred O
as O
of O
everything O
else O
. O
Always O
to O
be O
right O
, O
always O


to O
trample O
forward O
, O
and O
never O
to O
doubt O
, O
are O
not O
these O
the O
great O
qualities O


with O
which O
dullness O
takes O
the O
lead O
in O

under O

the O
poor O

Her O
eyes O
were O
fixed O

looking O

They O
stared O


blank O
in O
the O
face O
of O
Osborne B-PERSON

as O
the O

crossed O
each O

, O
but O
she O


did O
not O

until O
looking O
up O

he O
saw O
Dobbin B-PERSON


riding O

then O
he O
knew O
who O
it O

He O
hated O

He O
did O
not O

how O
much O
until O
he O
saw O
her O
there O

When O
her O

he O
turned O


and O
stared O
at O
the O

with O
a O
curse O

defiance O
in O
his O
eye O
cast O
at O
his O


companion O

as O

 O
How O

you O

 O
 O
Tell O
the O
scoundrel O
to O

on O


quick O

 O
he O
shouted O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
to O
the O
lackey O
on O
the O
box O
. O
A B-TIME
minute I-TIME


afterwards O
, O
a O
horse O
came O
clattering O
over O
the O
pavement O
behind O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O


carriage O
, O
and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
rode O
up O
. O
His O
thoughts O
had O
been O
elsewhere O
as O
the O


carriages O
passed O
each O
other O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
he O
had O
ridden O
some O
paces O


forward O
, O
that O
he O
remembered O
it O
was O
Osborne B-PERSON
who O
had O
just O
passed O
him O
. O
Then O
he O


turned O
to O
examine O
if O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
father O
- O
in O
- O
law O
had O
made O
any O
impression O


on O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
but O
the O
poor O
girl O
did O
not O
know O
who O
had O
passed O
. O
Then O
William B-PERSON
, O
who O


daily B-DATE
used O
to O
accompany O
her O
in O
his O
drives O
, O
taking O
out O
his O
watch O
, O
made O
some O


excuse O
about O
an O
engagement O
which O
he O
suddenly O
recollected O
, O
and O
so O
rode O
off O
. O


She O
did O
not O
remark O
that O
either O
; O
but O
sate O
looking O
before O
her O
, O
over O
the O
homely O


landscape O
towards O
the O
woods O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
by O
which O
George B-PERSON
marched O


away O

 O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
! O
 O
cried O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
as O
he O
rode O
up O
and O
held O
out O
his O


hand O
. O
Osborne B-PERSON
made O
no O
motion O
to O
take O
it O
, O
but O
shouted O
out O
once O
more O
and O
with O


another O
curse O
to O
his O
servant O
to O
drive O
on O
. O


Dobbin B-PERSON
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
carriage O
side O
. O
 O
I O
will O
see O
you O
, O
sir O
, O
 O
he O
said O
. O


 O
I O
have O
a O
message O
for O
you O
. O
 O


 O
From O
that O
woman O
? O
 O
said O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
fiercely O
. O


 O
No O
, O
 O
replied O
the O
other O
, O
 O
from O
your O
son O
; O
 O
at O
which O
Osborne B-PERSON
fell O
back O
into O


the O
corner O
of O
his O
carriage O
, O
and O
Dobbin B-PERSON
allowing O
it O
to O
pass O
on O
, O
rode O
close O


behind O
it O
, O
and O
so O
through O
the O
town O
until O
they O
reached O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
hotel O
, O


and O
without O
a O
word O
. O
There O
he O
followed O
Osborne B-PERSON
up O
to O
his O
apartments O
. O
George B-PERSON


had O
often O
been O
in O
the O
rooms O
; O
they O
were O
the O
lodgings O
which O
the O
Crawleys B-ORG
had O


occupied O
during O
their O
stay O
in O
Brussels B-GPE

 O
Pray O
, O
have O
you O
any O
commands O
for O
me O
, O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
or O
, O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O


I O
should O
say O

Major O

Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
since O
better O
men O
than O
you O
are O
dead O
, O
and O


you O
step O
into O
their O

shoes O
? O
 O

said O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
in O
that O
sarcastic O


tone O
which O
he O
sometimes O
was O
pleased O
to O
assume O
. O


 O
Better O
men O

are O

dead O
, O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
replied O
. O
 O
I O
want O
to O
speak O
to O
you O


about O
one O
. O
 O


 O
Make O
it O
short O
, O
sir O
, O
 O
said O
the O
other O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
scowling O
at O
his O


visitor O
. O


 O
I O
am O
here O
as O
his O
closest O
friend O
, O
 O
the O
Major O
resumed O
, O
 O
and O
the O
executor O
of O


his O
will O
. O
He O
made O
it O
before O
he O
went O
into O
action O
. O
Are O
you O
aware O
how O
small O
his O


means O
are O
, O
and O
of O
the O
straitened O
circumstances O
of O
his O
widow O
? O
 O


 O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
his O
widow O
, O
sir O
, O
 O
Osborne B-PERSON
said O
. O
 O
Let O
her O
go O
back O
to O
her O


father O
. O
 O
But O
the O
gentleman O
whom O
he O
addressed O
was O
determined O
to O
remain O
in O


good O
temper O
, O
and O
went O
on O
without O
heeding O
the O
interruption O
. O


 O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
condition O
? O
Her O
life O
and O
her O
reason O
almost O


have O
been O
shaken O
by O
the O
blow O
which O
has O
fallen O
on O
her O
. O
It O
is O
very O
doubtful O


whether O
she O
will O
rally O
. O
There O
is O
a O
chance O
left O
for O
her O
, O
however O
, O
and O
it O
is O


about O
this O
I O
came O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
. O
She O
will O
be O
a O
mother O
soon O
. O
Will O
you O
visit O


the O
parent O
’s O
offence O
upon O
the O
child O
’s O
head O
? O
or O
will O
you O
forgive O
the O
child O


for O
poor O
George B-PERSON
’s O
sake O
? O
 O


Osborne B-PERSON
broke O
out O
into O
a O
rhapsody O
of O
self O
- O
praise O
and O
imprecations;—by O
the O


first O
, O
excusing O
himself O
to O
his O
own O
conscience O
for O
his O
conduct O
; O
by O
the O


second B-ORDINAL
, O
exaggerating O
the O
undutifulness O
of O
George B-PERSON
. O
No O
father O
in O
all O
England B-GPE


could O
have O
behaved O
more O
generously O
to O
a O
son O
, O
who O
had O
rebelled O
against O
him O


wickedly O
. O
He O
had O
died O
without O
even O
so O
much O
as O
confessing O
he O
was O
wrong O
. O
Let O


him O
take O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
undutifulness O
and O
folly O
. O
As O
for O
himself O
, O


Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
his O
word O
. O
He O
had O
sworn O
never O
to O

to O
that O


woman O
, O
or O
to O
recognize O
her O
as O
his O
son O

 O
And O
that O
’s O
what O
you O
may O
tell O


her O
, O
 O
he O
concluded O
with O
an O
oath O
; O
 O
and O
that O
’s O
what O
I O
will O
stick O
to O
to O
the O


last B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
my O
life O
. O
 O


There O
was O
no O
hope O
from O
that B-DATE
quarter I-DATE
then O
. O
The O
widow O
must O
live O
on O
her O


slender O
pittance O
, O
or O
on O
such O
aid O
as O
Jos B-PERSON
could O
give O
her O
. O
 O
I O
might O
tell O
her O
, O


and O
she O
would O
not O
heed O
it O
, O
 O
thought O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
sadly O
: O
for O
the O
poor O
girl O
’s O


thoughts O
were O
not O
here O
at O
all O
since O
her O
catastrophe O
, O
and O
, O
stupefied O
under O


the O
pressure O
of O
her O
sorrow O
, O
good O
and O
evil O
were O
alike O
indifferent O
to O
her O
. O


So O
, O
indeed O
, O
were O
even O
friendship O
and O
kindness O
. O
She O
received O
them O
both O


uncomplainingly O
, O
and O
having O
accepted O
them O
, O
relapsed O
into O
her O
grief O
. O


Suppose O
some B-DATE
twelve I-DATE
months I-DATE
after O
the O
above O
conversation O
took O
place O
to O
have O


passed O
in O
the O
life O
of O
our O
poor O
Amelia B-PERSON
She O
has O
spent O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
portion O
of O


that O
time O
in O
a O
sorrow O
so O
profound O
and O
pitiable O
, O
that O
we O
who O
have O
been O


watching O
and O
describing O
some O
of O
the O
emotions O
of O
that O
weak O
and O
tender O
heart O
, O


must O
draw O
back O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
cruel O
grief O
under O
which O
it O
is O


bleeding O
. O
Tread O
silently O
round O
the O
hapless O
couch O
of O
the O
poor O
prostrate O
soul O
. O


Shut O
gently O
the O
door O
of O
the O
dark O
chamber O
wherein O
she O
suffers O
, O
as O
those O
kind O


people O
did O
who O
nursed O
her O
through O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
months I-DATE
of O
her O
pain O
, O
and O
never O


left O
her O
until O
heaven O
had O
sent O
her O
consolation O
. O
A B-DATE
day I-DATE
came O
— O
of O
almost O


terrified O
delight O
and O
wonder O
— O
when O
the O
poor O
widowed O
girl O
pressed O
a O
child O
upon O


her O
breast O
— O
a O
child O
, O
with O
the O
eyes O
of O
George B-PERSON
who O
was O
gone O
— O
a O
little O
boy O
, O
as O


beautiful O
as O
a O
cherub O
. O
What O
a O
miracle O
it O
was O
to O
hear O
its O
first B-ORDINAL
cry O
! O
How O
she O


laughed O
and O
wept O
over O
it O
— O
how O
love O
, O
and O
hope O
, O
and O
prayer O
woke O
again O
in O
her O


bosom O
as O
the O
baby O
nestled O
there O
. O
She O
was O
safe O
. O
The O
doctors O
who O
attended O
her O
, O


and O
had O
feared O
for O
her O
life O
or O
for O
her O
brain O
, O
had O
waited O
anxiously O
for O
this O


crisis O
before O
they O
could O
pronounce O
that O
either O
was O
secure O
. O
It O
was O
worth O
the O


long O
months B-DATE
of O
doubt O
and O
dread O
which O
the O
persons O
who O
had O
constantly O
been O


with O
her O
had O
passed O
, O
to O
see O
her O
eyes O
once O
more O
beaming O
tenderly O
upon O


them O
. O


Our O
friend O
Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
one O
of O
them O
. O
It O
was O
he O
who O
brought O
her O
back O
to O


England B-GPE
and O
to O
her O
mother O
’s O
house O
; O
when O
Mrs. O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
, O
receiving O
a O
peremptory O


summons O
from O
her O
Colonel O
, O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
quit O
her O
patient O

To O
see O
Dobbin B-PERSON


holding O
the O
infant O
, O
and O
to O
hear O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
laugh O
of O
triumph O
as O
she O
watched O


him O
, O
would O
have O
done O
any O
man O
good O
who O
had O
a O
sense O
of O
humour O
. O
William B-PERSON
was O
the O


godfather O
of O
the O
child O
, O
and O
exerted O
his O
ingenuity O
in O
the O
purchase O
of O
cups O
, O


spoons O
, O
pap O
- O
boats O
, O
and O
corals O
for O
this O
little O
Christian B-NORP

How O
his O
mother O
nursed O
him O
, O
and O
dressed O
him O
, O
and O
lived O
upon O
him O
; O
how O
she O


drove O
away O
all O
nurses O
, O
and O
would O
scarce O
allow O
any O
hand O
but O
her O
own O
to O
touch O


him O
; O
how O
she O
considered O
that O
the O
greatest O
favour O
she O
could O
confer O
upon O
his O


godfather O
, O
Major O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
was O
to O
allow O
the O
Major O
occasionally O
to O
dandle O
him O
, O


need O
not O
be O
told O
here O
. O
This O
child O
was O
her O
being O

Her O
existence O
was O
a O


maternal O
caress O
. O
She O
enveloped O
the O
feeble O
and O
unconscious O
creature O
with O
love O


and O
worship O
. O
It O
was O
her O
life O
which O
the O
baby O
drank O
in O
from O
her O
bosom O
. O
Of O


nights O
, O
and O
when O
alone O
, O
she O
had O
stealthy O
and O
intense O
raptures O
of O
motherly O


love O
, O
such O
as O
God O
’s O
marvellous O
care O
has O
awarded O
to O
the O
female O
instinct O
— O
joys O


how O
far O
higher O
and O
lower O
than O
reason O
— O
blind O
beautiful O
devotions O
which O
only O


women O

It O
was O
William B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON

task O
to O
muse O
upon O
these O


movements O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON

, O
and O
to O
watch O
her O

if O
his O
love O
made O
him O


divine O
almost O
all O
the O
feelings O
which O
agitated O
it O
, O
alas O

he O
could O
see O
with O
a O


fatal O
perspicuity O
that O
there O
was O
no O

there O
for O
him O

And O
so O

gently O

he O


bore O
his O
fate O

knowing O
it O

and O
content O
to O
bear O
it O
. O


I O
suppose O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
father O
and O
mother O
saw O
through O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O


Major O
, O
and O
were O
not O
ill O

disposed O
to O
encourage O
him O
; O
for O
Dobbin B-PERSON
visited O
their O


house O
daily B-DATE

stayed O
for O
hours B-TIME
with O
them O
, O
or O
with O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
or O
with O
the O


honest O
landlord O
, O
Mr. O
Clapp B-PERSON
, O
and O
his O
family O

He O
brought O

on O
one B-CARDINAL
pretext O

another O

presents O
to O
everybody O
, O
and O
almost B-DATE
every I-DATE

; O
and O
went O
, O
with O
the O


landlord O
’s O
little O
girl O
, O
who O
was O
rather O
a O
favourite O
with O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
by O
the O
name O


of O
Major O
Sugarplums B-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
this O
little O
child O
who O
commonly O
acted O
as O
mistress O


of O
the O
ceremonies O
to O
introduce O
him O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON

She O
laughed O
one O
day O
when O


Major O
Sugarplums B-PERSON
’ O
cab O
drove O
up O
to O
Fulham B-ORG
, O
and O
he O
descended O
from O
it O

bringing O


out O
a O
wooden O
horse O
, O
a O
drum O
, O
a O
trumpet O
, O
and O
other O
warlike O
toys O
, O
for O
little O


Georgy B-PERSON

who O
was O
scarcely O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
old I-DATE
, O
and O
for O
whom O
the O
articles O
in O


question O
were O
entirely O
premature O

The O
child O
was O
asleep O
. O
 O
Hush B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
annoyed O
, O
perhaps O
, O
at O
the O


creaking O
of O
the O
Major O
’s O
boots O
; O
and O
she O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
; O
smiling O
because O


William B-PERSON
could O
not O
take O
it O
until O
he O
had O
rid O
himself O
of O
his O
cargo O
of O
toys O

 O
Go O


downstairs O
, O
little O
Mary B-PERSON

 O
said O
he O
presently O
to O
the O
child O
, O
 O
I O
want O
to O
speak O


to O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON

 O
She O
looked O
up O
rather O
astonished O
, O
and O
laid O
down O
the O
infant O


on O
its O
bed O
. O


 O
I O
am O
come O
to O
say O
good O
- O
bye O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
he O
, O
taking O
her O
slender O
little O


white O
hand O
gently O
. O


 O
Good O
- O
bye O
? O
and O
where O
are O
you O
going O

 O
she O
said O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
. O


 O
Send O
the O
letters O
to O
the O
agents O
, O
 O
he O
said O
; O
 O
they O
will O
forward O
them O

for O
you O


will O
write O

wo O

you O

I O
shall O
be O
away O
a O
long O
time O

 O


 O
I O
’ll O
write O
to O
you O
about O
Georgy B-PERSON

 O
she O
said O
. O
 O
Dear O
William B-PERSON
, O
how O
good O
you O


have O
been O
to O
him O
and O
to O
me O
. O
Look O
at O
him O
. O
Is O
n’t O
he O
like O
an O
angel O
? O
 O


The O
little O
pink O
hands O
of O
the O
child O
closed O
mechanically O
round O
the O
honest O


soldier O
’s O
finger O
, O
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
looked O
up O
in O
his O
face O
with O
bright O
maternal O


pleasure O
. O
The O
cruellest O
looks O
could O
not O
have O
wounded O
him O
more O
than O
that O


glance O
of O
hopeless O
kindness O
. O
He O
bent O
over O
the O
child O
and O
mother O
. O
He O
could O
not O


speak O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
And O
it O
was O
only O
with O
all O
his O
strength O
that O
he O
could O


force O
himself O
to O
say O
a O
God O

of O
which O
we O
can O
afford O

but O
a O
very O
brief O
history O
, O
Crawley B-PERSON
and O
his O


wife O
lived O
very O
happily O
and O
comfortably O
at O
Paris B-GPE
. O
It O
was O
in O
this O
period O
that O


he O
quitted O
the O
Guards O
, O
and O
sold O
out O
of O
the O
army O
. O
When O
we O
find O
him O
again O
, O
his O


mustachios O
and O
the O
title O
of O
Colonel O
on O
his O
card O
are O
the O
only O
relics O
of O
his O


military O
profession O
. O


It O
has O
been O
mentioned O
that O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
soon O
after O
her O
arrival O
in O
Paris B-GPE
, O
took O
a O


very O
smart O
and O
leading O
position O
in O
the O
society O
of O
that O
capital O
, O
and O
was O


welcomed O
at O
some O
of O
the O
most O
distinguished O
houses O
of O
the O
restored O
French B-NORP


nobility O
. O
The O
English B-NORP
men O
of O
fashion O
in O
Paris B-GPE
courted O
her O
, O
too O
, O
to O
the O


disgust O
of O
the O
ladies O
their O
wives O
, O
who O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
parvenue O
. O
For O
some B-DATE


months I-DATE
the O
salons O
of O
the B-FAC
Faubourg I-FAC
St. I-FAC
Germain I-FAC
, O
in O
which O
her O
place O
was O


secured O
, O
and O
the O
splendours O
of O
the O
new O
Court B-ORG
, O
where O
she O
was O
received O
with O


much O
distinction O
, O
delighted O
, O
and O
perhaps O
a O
little O
intoxicated O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O


who O
may O
have O
been O
disposed O
during O
this O
period O
of O

to O
slight O
the O


people O
— O
honest O
young O
military O
men O
mostly O
— O
who O
formed O
her O
husband O
’s O
chief O


society O
. O


But O
the O
Colonel O
yawned O
sadly O
among O
the O
duchesses O
and O
great O
ladies O
of O
the O


Court B-ORG
. O
The O
old O
women O
who O
played O

écarté B-GPE

made O
such O
a O
noise O
about O
a O


five B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
franc I-MONEY
piece O
, O
that O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
while O
to O
sit O
down O


at O
a O
card O
- O
table O
. O
The O
wit O
of O
their O
conversation O
he O
could O
not O
appreciate O
, O


being O
ignorant O
of O
their O
language O
. O
And O
what O
good O
could O
his O
wife O
get O
, O
he O


urged O
, O
by O
making O
curtsies O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
to O
a O
whole O
circle O
of O
Princesses B-PERSON
? O
He O


left O
Rebecca B-PERSON
presently O
to O
frequent O
these O
parties O
alone O
; O
resuming O
his O
own O


simple O
pursuits O
and O
amusements O
amongst O
the O
amiable O
friends O
of O
his O
own O


choice O
. O


The O
truth O
is O
, O
when O
we O
say O
of O
a O
gentleman O
that O
he O
lives O
elegantly O
on O
nothing O


a B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
we O
use O
the O
word O
 O
nothing O
 O
to O
signify O
something O
unknown O
; O
meaning O
, O


simply O
, O
that O
we O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
the O
gentleman O
in O
question O
defrays B-PERSON
the O


expenses O
of O
his O
establishment O
. O
Now O
, O
our O
friend O
the O
Colonel O
had O
a O
great O


aptitude O
for O
all O
games O
of O
chance O
: O
and O
exercising O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
continually O


did O
, O
with O
the O
cards O
, O
the O
dice O
- O
box O
, O
or O
the O
cue O
, O
it O
is O
natural O
to O
suppose O
that O


he O
attained O
a O
much O
greater O
skill O
in O
the O
use O
of O
these O
articles O
than O
men O
can O


possess O
who O
only O
occasionally O
handle O
them O
. O
To O
use O
a O
cue O
at O
billiards O
well O
is O


like O
using O
a O
pencil O
, O
or O
a O
German B-NORP
flute O
, O
or O
a O
small O
- O
sword O
— O
you O
can O
not O
master O


any O
one O
of O
these O
implements O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
it O
is O
only O
by O
repeated O
study O
and O


perseverance O
, O
joined O
to O
a O
natural O
taste O
, O
that O
a O
man O
can O
excel O
in O
the O


handling O
of O
either O
. O
Now O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
from O
being O
only O
a O
brilliant O
amateur O
, O
had O


grown O
to O
be O
a O
consummate O
master O
of O
billiards O
. O
Like O
a O
great O
general O
, O
his O


genius O
used O
to O
rise O
with O
the O
danger O
, O
and O
when O
the O
luck O
had O
been O
unfavourable O


to O
him O
for O
a O
whole O
game O
, O
and O
the O
bets O
were O
consequently O
against O
him O
, O
he O


would O
, O
with O
consummate O
skill O
and O
boldness O
, O
make O
some O
prodigious O
hits O
which O


would O
restore O
the O
battle O
, O
and O
come O
in O
a O
victor O
at O
the O
end O
, O
to O
the O


astonishment O
of O
everybody O
— O
of O
everybody O
, O
that O
is O
, O
who O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
his O


play O
. O
Those O
who O
were O
accustomed O
to O
see O
it O
were O
cautious O
how O
they O
staked O


their O
money O
against O
a O
man O
of O
such O
sudden O
resources O
, O
and O
brilliant O
and O


over O
- O
powering O
skill O
. O


At O
games O
of O
cards O
he O
was O
equally O
skilful O
; O
for O
though O
he O
would O
constantly O


lose O
money O
at O
the O
commencement O
of O
an O
evening O
, O
playing O
so O
carelessly O
and O


making O
such O
blunders O
, O
that O
new O
comers O
were O
often O
inclined O
to O
think O
meanly O
of O


his O
talent O
; O
yet O
when O
roused O
to O
action O
, O
and O
awakened O
to O
caution O
by O
repeated O


small O
losses O
, O
it O
was O
remarked O
that O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
play O
became O
quite O
different O
, O


and O
that O
he O
was O
pretty O
sure O
of O
beating O
his O
enemy O
thoroughly O
before O
the O
night O


was O
over O
. O
Indeed O
, O
very O
few O
men O
could O
say O
that O
they O
ever O
had O
the O
better O
of O


him O
. O


His O
successes O
were O
so O
repeated O
that O
no O
wonder O
the O
envious O
and O
the O


vanquished O
spoke O
sometimes O
with O
bitterness O
regarding O
them O
. O
And O
as O
the O
French B-NORP


say O
of O
the O
Duke O
of O
Wellington B-GPE
, O
who O
never O
suffered O
a O
defeat O
, O
that O
only O
an O


astonishing O
series O
of O
lucky O
accidents O
enabled O
him O
to O
be O
an O
invariable O


winner O
; O
yet O
even O
they O
allow O
that O
he O
cheated O
at O
Waterloo B-GPE
, O
and O
was O
enabled O
to O


win O
the O
last O
great O
trick:—so O
it O
was O
hinted O
at O
head O
- O
quarters O
in O
England B-GPE
, O
that O


some O
foul O
play O
must O
have O
taken O
place O
in O
order O
to O
account O
for O
the O
continuous O


successes O
of O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
. O


Though O
Frascati B-ORG
’s O
and O
the O
Salon B-ORG
were O
open O
at O
that O
time O
in O
Paris B-GPE
, O
the O
mania O


for O
play O
was O
so O
widely O
spread O
, O
that O
the O
public O
gambling O
- O
rooms O
did O
not O


suffice O
for O
the O
general O
ardour O
, O
and O
gambling O
went O
on O
in O
private O
houses O
as O


much O
as O
if O
there O
had O
been O
no O
public O
means O
for O
gratifying O
the O
passion O

At O


Crawley B-PERSON

Mrs. O

She O
spoke O
about O
her O

with O
the O
deepest O


grief O
; O
she O
bewailed O
it O
to O
everybody O
who O
came O

her O
house O

She O
besought O
the O


young O

never O

never O

; O
and O
when O

a O
very O
considerable O
sum O
of O

felt O

At O
this O
juncture O
news O
arrived O
which O
was O
spread O
among O
the O

the O

it O
might O

for O

he O
owed O
more O

The O

the O

Mr. O

friends O

And O
the O
old O
man O
not O
only O
let O
his O
house O

the O
Colonel O

but O


officiated O
as O
his O
butler O
whenever O
he O
had O
company O

Mrs. O
Raggles B-PERSON
operating O

the O

sending O
up O

which O
old O
Miss O

This O
was O
the O
way O

then O
, O
Crawley B-PERSON
got O
his O
house O
for O


nothing O

for O
though O
Raggles O

unlucky O
Raggles O

Colonel O

defective O

I O
wonder O
how O

are O
driven O
to O
roguery O
and O
to O
ruin O
by O
great O


practitioners O
in O
Crawley B-GPE

many O
great O
noblemen O
rob O
their O
petty O


tradesmen O

condescend O
to O
swindle O
their O
poor O
retainers O
out O
of O
wretched O
little O


sums O
, O
and O
cheat O
for O
a O
few O
shillings O
? O
When O
we O
read O
that O
a O
noble O
nobleman O
has O


left O
for O
the O

or O
that O
another O
noble O
nobleman O
has O
an O
execution O
in O


his O
house O
— O
and O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
other O
owes O
six B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
seven I-CARDINAL
millions I-CARDINAL
, O
the O
defeat O
seems O


glorious O
even O
, O
and O
we O
respect O
the O
victim O
in O
the O
vastness O
of O
his O
ruin O
. O
But O


who O
pities O
a O
poor O

who O
ca O
n’t O
get O
his O

this O

In O
a O

such O

can O
not O

We O

So O
, O
probably O
, O
200 B-CARDINAL
and O
202 B-CARDINAL
in O
Curzon B-ORG

might O
know O
what O

in O
the O

between O

the O

but O
Crawley B-PERSON

his O

did O
not O
know O
200 B-CARDINAL
and O
202 B-CARDINAL

When O
you O
came O
to O
201 B-CARDINAL
there O
was O
a O
hearty O


welcome O

and O
a O
kind O
smile O

a O
good O
dinner O

and O
a O
jolly O

from O


the O

and O
hostess O
there O
, O
just O
for O
all O

undisputed O
masters O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
a O

and O
so O
they O
were O
not O
in O


money O

but O
in O

if O
they O
did O

they O


had O
it O

if O

how O
should O


we O

Never O
was O
better O
claret O

at O

Rawdon B-PERSON

dinners O
more O
gay O

His O

were O
the O

little O

were O
decorated O

a B-CARDINAL

when O

sate O


at O

the O

himself O

that O

Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
wit O

cleverness O

and O
flippancy O
, O
made O
her O
speedily O
the O
vogue O
in O


London B-GPE
among O
a O
certain O
class O
. O
You O
saw O
demure O
chariots O
at O
her O
door O
, O
out O
of O


which O
stepped O
very O
great O
people O
. O
You O
beheld O
her O
carriage O
in O
the O
Park O
, O


surrounded O
by O
dandies O
of O
note O

The O
little O
box O
in O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
tier O
of O
the O
Opera B-ORG


was O
crowded O
with O
heads O
constantly O
changing O
; O
but O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
that O


the O
ladies O
held O
aloof O
from O
her O
, O
and O
that O
their O
doors O
were O
shut O
to O
our O
little O


adventurer O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
world O
of O
female O

its O
customs O
, O
the O
present O


writer O

can O
only O
speak O
at O

A O
man O
can O
no O
more O
penetrate O


or O
understand O
those O
mysteries O
than O
he O
can O
know O
what O
the O
ladies O
talk O
about O


when O
they O
go O
upstairs O
after O
dinner O
. O
It O
is O
only O
by O
inquiry O
and O
perseverance O
, O


that O
one B-CARDINAL
sometimes O
gets O
hints O
of O
those O
secrets O
; O
and O
by O
a O
similar O
diligence O


every O

who O

something O


about O

men O

such O

Rawdon B-GPE

whose O
position O

who O
cut O
a O

to O
the O


eyes O
of O
the O

to O
the O

in O

who O
behold O


them O
consorting O

the O

there O

the O

Mrs. O

laboriously O
in O


the O

Men O
living O

these O

You O
hear O
how O
pitilessly O
many O
ladies O
of O
seeming O
rank O

are O


excluded O
from O
this O
 O

 O
The O
frantic O

make O
to O

this O
circle O
, O
the O
meannesses O
to O
which O
they O
submit O
, O
the O
insults O
which O
they O


undergo O
, O
are O
matters O
of O
wonder O
to O
those O
who O
take O
human O
or O
womankind O
for O
a O


study O
; O
and O
the O
pursuit O
of O
fashion O
under O
difficulties O
would O
be O
a O
fine O
theme O


for O
any O
very O
great O
person O
who O
had O
the O
wit O
, O
the O
leisure O

and O
the O
knowledge O

the O
English B-LANGUAGE

Now O
the O
few O
female O
acquaintances O
whom O
Mrs. O

had O
known O
abroad O
, O
not O


only O
declined O
to O
visit O
her O
when O
she O
came O
to O
this O
side O
of O
the O
channel O
, O
but O


cut O
her O
severely O
when O
they O
met O
in O
public O
places O
. O
It O
was O
curious O
to O
see O
how O


the O
great O
ladies O
forgot O
her O
, O
and O
no O
doubt O
not O
altogether O
a O
pleasant O
study O
to O


Rebecca B-PERSON
. O
When O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres I-PERSON
met O
her O
in O
the O
waiting O
- O
room O
at O
the O
Opera B-ORG
, O
she O


gathered O
her O
daughters O
about O
her O
as O
if O
they O
would O
be O
contaminated O
by O
a O
touch O


of O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
and O
retreating O
a O
step O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
placed O
herself O
in O
front O
of O
them O
, O
and O


stared O
at O
her O
little O
enemy O
. O
To O
stare O
Becky B-PERSON
out O
of O
countenance O
required O
a O


severer O
glance O
than O
even O
the O
frigid O
old O
Bareacres B-PERSON
could O
shoot O
out O
of O
her O


dismal O
eyes O

When O

who O
had O
ridden O
a O
score O
of O
times O
by O


Becky B-PERSON

met O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON

open O
carriage O
in O
Hyde B-GPE
Park I-GPE
, O
her O


Ladyship O
was O
quite O
blind O

could O
not O
in O
the O

recognise O
her O
former O


friend O

Even O
Mrs. O
Blenkinsop B-PERSON

the O

wife O
, O
cut O
her O
at O

. O
Becky B-PERSON


went O
regularly O
to O

now O
; O
it O
was O
edifying O
to O
see O
her O
enter O
there O
with O


Rawdon B-PERSON
by O
her O
side O
, O
carrying O
a O
couple O
of O
large O
gilt O
prayer O

and O


afterwards O
going O
through O
the O
ceremony O
with O
the O
gravest O
resignation O
. O


Rawdon B-PERSON
at O
first B-ORDINAL
felt O
very O
acutely O
the O
slights O
which O
were O
passed O
upon O
his O


wife O
, O
and O
was O
inclined O
to O
be O
gloomy O
and O
savage O
. O
He O
talked O
of O
calling O
out O
the O


husbands O
or O
brothers O
of O
every O
one O
of O
the O
insolent O
women O
who O
did O
not O
pay O
a O


proper O
respect O
to O
his O
wife O
; O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
the O
strongest O
commands O
and O


entreaties O
on O
her O
part O
, O
that O
he O
was O
brought O
into O
keeping O
a O
decent O
behaviour O
. O


 O
You O
ca O
n’t O
shoot O
me O
into O
society O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
good O

naturedly O

 O
Remember O
, O
my O


dear O

that O
I O
was O
but O
a O
governess O

and O
you O
, O
you O
poor O
silly O
old O
man O
, O

the O


worst O
reputation O
for O

all O

We O
shall O


get O
quite O
as O
many O
friends O
as O
we O
want O
by O

by O

in O
the O

you O


must O
be O
a O
good O
boy O
, O
and O
obey O
your O
schoolmistress O
in O
everything O
she O
tells O
you O


to O

When O

that O

everything O

his O

do O
you O

that O

instead O
of O
the O
twenty B-CARDINAL

calculated O

was O
in O
such O
a O

at O
his O


disappointment O

that O
he O
vented O
it O
in O
savage O

Rawdon B-PERSON

conduct O

on O

Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
received O
this O
communication O
very O
graciously O
— O
more O
graciously O


than O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
received O
some O
of O
Rebecca B-PERSON
’s O
previous O
compositions O
in O


Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
handwriting O
; O
and O
as O
for O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
so O
charmed O
with O
the O


letter O
, O
that O
she O
expected O
her O
husband O
would O
instantly O
divide O
his O
aunt O
’s O


legacy O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
equal O
portions O
, O
and O
send O
off O
one B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
to O
his O
brother O
at O


Paris B-GPE
. O


To O
her O
ladyship O
’s O
surprise O
, O
however O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
declined O
to O
accommodate O
his O


brother O
with O
a O
cheque O
for O
thirty B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
. O
But O
he O
made O
Rawdon B-PERSON
a O


handsome O
offer O
of O
his O
hand O
whenever O
the O
latter O
should O
come O
to O
England B-GPE
and O


choose O
to O
take O
it O
; O
and O
, O
thanking O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
for O
her O
good O
opinion O
of O


himself O
and O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane I-PERSON
, O
he O
graciously O
pronounced O
his O
willingness O
to O
take O
any O


opportunity O
to O
serve O
her O
little O
boy O
. O


Thus O
an O
almost O
reconciliation O
was O
brought O
about O
between O
the O
brothers O
. O
When O


Rebecca B-PERSON
came O
to O
town O
Pitt B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
not O
in O
London B-GPE
. O
Many O
a O
time O
she O


drove O
by O
the O
old O
door O
in O
Park B-GPE
Lane I-GPE
to O
see O
whether O
they O
had O
taken O
possession O


of O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
house O
there O
. O
But O
the O
new O
family O
did O
not O
make O
its O


appearance O
; O
it O
was O
only O
through O
Raggles O
that O
she O
heard O
of O
their O


movements O
— O
how O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
domestic O
had O
been O
dismissed O
with O
decent O


gratuities O

and O
how O
Mr. O

had O
only O
once O
made O
his O
appearance O
in O
London B-GPE
, O


when O
he O
stopped O

a B-DATE
few I-DATE

business O
with O
his O

a O

out O
of O


Bond B-FAC
Street I-FAC

Becky B-PERSON
had O
reasons O
of O
her O
own O
which O
caused O
her O
to O
long O
for O
the O


arrival O
of O
her O
new O
relation O

 O
When O
Lady O

They O
lighted O
up O
Rebecca B-PERSON

Amelia B-PERSON

the O

this O

all O

Her O

flushed O
up O

until O

when O

a O

She O
seized O
the O

out O

her O

then O
grasped O
at O
the O

the O

at O
her O

furious O

and O
holding O
the O

Amelia B-PERSON

 O
I O

 O
this O

 O


 O
Very O

 O

 O
This O

so O

Till O
the O
termination O
of O
her O
natural O
life O
, O
this O
breach O
between O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON


and O
her O
daughter O
was O
never O
thoroughly O
mended O
. O
The O
quarrel O
gave O
the O
elder O


lady O
numberless O
advantages O
which O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
turn O
to O
account O
with O


female O
ingenuity O
and O
perseverance O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
she O
scarcely O
spoke O
to O


Amelia B-PERSON
for O
many B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
afterwards O
. O
She O
warned O
the O
domestics O
not O
to O
touch O
the O


child O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
might O
be O
offended O
. O
She O
asked O
her O
daughter O
to O
see O
and O


satisfy O
herself O
that O
there O
was O
no O
poison O
prepared O
in O
the O
little O
daily O
messes O


that O
were O
concocted O
for O
Georgy B-PERSON
. O
When O
neighbours O
asked O
after O
the O
boy O
’s O


health O
, O
she O
referred O
them O
pointedly O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
. O

She O

never O


ventured O
to O
ask O
whether O
the O
baby O
was O
well O
or O
not O
. O

She O

would O
not O


touch O
the O
child O
, O
although O
he O
was O
her O
grandson O
, O
and O
own O
precious O
darling O
, O
for O


she O
was O
not O

used O

to O
children O
, O
and O
might O
kill O
it O
. O
And O
whenever O
Mr. O


Pestler B-PERSON
came O
upon O
his O
healing O
inquisition O
, O
she O
received O
the O
Doctor O
with O
such O


a O
sarcastic O
and O
scornful O
demeanour O
, O
as O
made O
the O
surgeon O
declare O
that O
not O


Lady B-PERSON
Thistlewood I-PERSON
herself O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
attending O


professionally O
, O
could O
give O
herself O
greater O
airs O
than O
old O
Mrs. O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
from O


whom O
he O
never O
took O
a O
fee O
. O
And O
very O
likely O
Emmy B-PERSON
was O
jealous O
too O
, O
upon O
her O
own O


part O
, O
as O
what O
mother O
is O
not O
, O
of O
those O
who O
would O
manage O
her O
children O
for O
her O
, O


or O
become O
candidates O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
in O
their O
affections O
? O
It O
is O
certain O


that O
when O
anybody O
nursed O
the O
child O
, O
she O
was O
uneasy O
, O
and O
that O
she O
would O
no O


more O
allow O
Mrs. O
Clapp B-PERSON
or O
the O
domestic O
to O
dress O
or O
tend O
him O
, O
than O
she O
would O


have O
let O
them O
wash O
her O
husband O
’s O
miniature O
which O
hung O
up O
over O
her O
little O


bed:—the O
same O
little O
bed O
from O
which O
the O
poor O
girl O
had O
gone O
to O
his O
; O
and O
to O


which O
she O
retired O
now O
for O
many O
long O
, O
silent O
, O
tearful O
, O
but O
happy O
years B-DATE
. O


In O
this O
room O
was O
all O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
heart O
and O
treasure O
. O
Here O
it O
was O
that O
she O


tended O
her O
boy O
, O
and O
watched O
him O
through O
the O
many O
ills O
of O
childhood O
, O
with O
a O


constant O
passion O
of O
love O
. O
The O
elder O
George B-PERSON
returned O
in O
him O
somehow O
, O
only O


improved O
, O
and O
as O
if O
come O
back O
from O
heaven O
. O
In O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
little O
tones O
, O
looks O
, O


and O
movements O
, O
the O
child O
was O
so O
like O
his O
father O
, O
that O
the O
widow O
’s O
heart O


thrilled O
as O
she O
held O
him O
to O
it O
; O
and O
he O
would O
often O
ask O
the O
cause O
of O
her O


tears O
. O
It O
was O
because O
of O
his O
likeness O
to O
his O
father O
, O
she O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O


tell O
him O
. O
She O
talked O
constantly O
to O
him O
about O
this O
dead O
father O
, O
and O
spoke O
of O


her O
love O
for O
George B-PERSON
to O
the O
innocent O
and O
wondering O
child O
; O
much O
more O
than O
she O


ever O
had O
done O
to O
George B-PERSON
himself I-PERSON
, O
or O
to O
any O
confidante O
of O
her O
youth O
. O
To O
her O


parents O
she O
never O
talked O
about O
this O
matter O
; O
shrinking O
from O
baring O
her O
heart O


to O
them O
. O
Little O
George B-PERSON
very O
likely O
could O
understand O
no O
better O
than O
they O
; O
but O


into O
his O
ears O
she O
poured O
her O
sentimental O
secrets O
unreservedly O
, O
and O
into O
his O


only O
. O


The O
very O
joy O
of O
this O
woman O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
grief O
, O
or O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
, O


that O
its O
expression O
was O
tears O
. O
Her O
sensibilities O
were O
so O
weak O
and O
tremulous O
, O


that O
perhaps O
they O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
talked O
about O
in O
a O
book O
. O
I O
was O
told O
by O
Dr. O


Pestler B-PERSON
( O
now O
a O
most O
flourishing O
lady O
’s O
physician O
, O
with O
a O
sumptuous O
dark O


green O
carriage O
, O
a O
prospect O
of O
speedy O
knighthood O
, O
and O
a O
house O
in O
Manchester B-GPE


Square B-FAC
) O
, O
that O
her O
grief O
at O
weaning O
the O
child O
was O
a O
sight O
that O
would O
have O


unmanned O
a O
Herod B-PERSON
. O
He O
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
many O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
, O
his O
wife O
was O


mortally O
jealous O
of O
Mrs. O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
then O
and O
long O
afterwards O
. O


Perhaps O
the O
Doctor O
’s O
lady O
had O
good O
reason O
for O
her O
jealousy O
: O
most O
women O


shared O
it O
, O
of O
those O
who O
formed O
the O
small O
circle O
of O
Amelia B-PERSON
’s O
acquaintance O
, O


and O
were O
quite O
angry O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
the O
other O
sex O
regarded O


her O
. O
For O
almost O
all O
men O
who O
came O
near O
her O
loved O
her O
; O
though O
no O
doubt O
they O


would O
be O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
She O
was O
not O
brilliant O
, O
nor O
witty O
, O
nor O


wise O
over O
much O
, O
nor O
extraordinarily O
handsome O
. O
But O
wherever O
she O
went O
she O


touched O
and O
charmed O
every O
one O
of O
the O
male O
sex O
, O
as O
invariably O
as O
she O
awakened O


the O
scorn O
and O
incredulity O
of O
her O
own O
sisterhood O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
her O
weakness O


which O
was O
her O
principal O
charm:—a O
kind O
of O
sweet O
submission O
and O
softness O
, O


which O
seemed O
to O
appeal O
to O
each O
man O
she O
met O
for O
his O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O


We O
have O
seen O
how O
in O
the O
regiment O
, O
though O
she O
spoke O
to O
but O
few O
of O
George B-PERSON
’s O


comrades O
there O
, O
all O
the O
swords O
of O
the O
young O
fellows O
at O
the O
mess O
- O
table O
would O


have O
leapt O
from O
their O
scabbards O
to O
fight O
round O
her O
; O
and O
so O
it O
was O
in O
the O


little O
narrow O
lodging O
- O
house O
and O
circle O
at O
Fulham B-ORG
, O
she O
interested O
and O
pleased O


everybody O
. O
If O
she O
had O
been O
Mrs. O
Mango B-PERSON
herself O
, O
of O
the O
great O
house O
of O
Mango B-ORG
, O


Plantain B-GPE
, O

Crutched B-ORG
Friars I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
magnificent O
proprietress O
of O
the O

Fulham B-ORG
, O
who O
gave O

déjeuners O

frequented O

and O
drove O
about O
the O

yellow O

bay O


horses O

such O
as O
the O
royal O

at O
Kensington B-GPE
themselves O
could O
not O
turn O


out O
— O
I O
say O
had O
she O
been O
Mrs. O
Mango B-PERSON
herself O

or O
her O
son O

Lady O
Mary B-PERSON

the O

the O

Thus O
it O
was O
not O
only O
Mr. O

the O

Mr. O

more O

if O

He O

Pestler B-ORG

sat O

Truth O

They O
slept O

She O


trusted O

Major O
Dobbin B-PERSON

an O

took O
his O
somewhat O

never O

How O

Whenever O
Amelia B-PERSON

he O
answered O

not O

But O
he O
sent O


over O
endless O
remembrances O
of O
himself O

his O

He O
ordered O

 O
Mr. O

These O
chess O

men O
were O
the O
delight O
of O
Georgy B-PERSON

life O
, O
who O
printed O
his O
first B-ORDINAL


letter O
in O
acknowledgment O

this O

He O
sent O
over O

the O

surreptitiously O
in O
the O


sideboard O

and O
half B-CARDINAL

killed O
himself O
with O

He O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
judgment O


upon O
him O
for O
stealing O

they O
were O
so O
hot O

Emmy B-PERSON
wrote O
a O
comical O
little O
account O


of O
this O
mishap O
to O
the O
major O
: O
it O
pleased O
him O
to O
think O
that O
her O
spirits O
were O


rallying O
, O
and O
that O
she O
could O
be O
merry O
sometimes O
now O

He O
sent O
over O
a O

The O

were O
worth O
fifty B-MONEY

as O


Mrs. O

 O
What O

is O
she O
wo O

 O
Mrs. O

Brompton B-PERSON

 O
Jos B-PERSON
never O

us O
such O

I O
am O
sure O

and O
grudges O
us O


everything O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
Major O
is O
over O
head O

ears O
in O
love O
with O


her O
: O
and O
yet O
, O
whenever O
I O
so O

as O
hint O
it O

she O
turns O
red O

begins O
to O


cry O

goes O

sits O
upstairs O
with O
her O
miniature O

I O

sick O

I O
wish O

 O


Amidst O
such O
humble O
scenes O
and O
associates O
George B-PERSON
’s O
early O
youth O
was O
passed O
, O


and O
the O
boy O
grew O
up O
delicate O
, O
sensitive O
, O
imperious O
, O
woman O
- O
bred O
— O
domineering O


the O
gentle O
mother O
whom O
he O
loved O
with O
passionate O
affection O
. O
He O
ruled O
all O
the O


rest O
of O
the O
little O
world O
round O
about O
him O
. O
As O
he O
grew O
, O
the O
elders O
were O
amazed O


at O
his O
haughty O
manner O
and O
his O
constant O
likeness O
to O
his O
father O
. O
He O
asked O


questions O
about O
everything O
, O
as O
inquiring O
youth O
will O
do O
. O
The O
profundity O
of O


his O
remarks O
and O
interrogatories O
astonished O
his O
old O
grandfather O
, O
who O


perfectly O
bored O
the O
club O
at O
the O
tavern O
with O
stories O
about O
the O
little O
lad O
’s O


learning O
and O
genius O
. O
He O
suffered O
his O
grandmother O
with O
a O
good O
- O
humoured O


indifference O
. O
The O
small O
circle O
round O
about O
him O
believed O
that O
the O
equal O
of O


the O
boy O
did O
not O
exist O
upon O
the O
earth O
. O
Georgy B-PERSON
inherited O
his O
father O
’s O
pride O
, O


and O
perhaps O
thought O
they O
were O
not O
wrong O
. O


When O
he O
grew O
to O
be O
about B-DATE
six I-DATE
years I-DATE
old I-DATE
, O
Dobbin B-PERSON
began O
to O
write O
to O
him O
very O


much O
. O
The O
Major O
wanted O
to O
hear O
that O
Georgy B-PERSON
was O
going O
to O
school O
, O
and O
hoped O
he O


would O
acquit O
himself O
with O
credit O
there O
: O
or O
would O
he O
have O
a O
good O
tutor O
at O


home O
? O
it O
was O
time O
that O
he O
should O
begin O
to O
learn O
; O
and O
his O
godfather O
and O


guardian O
hinted O
that O
he O
hoped O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
defray O
the O
charges O
of O
the O


boy O
’s O
education O
, O
which O
would O
fall O
heavily O
upon O
his O
mother O
’s O
straitened O


income O
. O
The O
Major O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
was O
always O
thinking O
about O
Amelia B-PERSON
and O
her O


little O
boy O
, O
and O
by O
orders O
to O
his O
agents O
kept O
the O
latter O
provided O
with O


picture O

and O
all O

Three B-DATE

before O
George B-PERSON

sixth B-ORDINAL
birth O
- O
day O
a O


gentleman O
in O
a O
gig O
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
servant O
, O
drove O
up O
to O
Mr. O
Sedley B-PERSON
’s O


house O
, O
and O
asked O
to O
see O
Master O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
: O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Woolsey B-PERSON
, O
military O


tailor O
, O
of O
Conduit B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
who O
came O
at O
the O
Major O

order O
to O
measure O
the O


young O
gentleman O
for O
a O
suit O
of O
clothes O

He O
had O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
making O
for O


the O
Captain O

the O
young O
gentleman O

father O

Sometimes O
, O
too O
, O
and O
by O
the O
Major O
’s O
desire O
no O
doubt O
, O
his O
sisters O
, O
the O
Misses O


Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
would O
call O
in O
the O
family O
carriage O
to O
take O
Amelia B-PERSON
and O
the O
little O
boy O


for O
a O
drive O
if O
they O
were O
so O
inclined O
. O
The O
patronage O
and O
kindness O
of O
these O


ladies O
was O
very O
uncomfortable O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
but O
she O
bore O
it O
meekly O
enough O
, O
for O


her O
nature O
was O
to O
yield O
; O
and O
, O
besides O
, O
the O
carriage O
and O
its O
splendours O
gave O


little O
Georgy B-PERSON
immense O
pleasure O
. O
The O
ladies O
begged O
occasionally O
that O
the O


child O
might O
pass O
a O
day O
with O
them O
, O
and O
he O
was O
always O
glad O
to O
go O
to O
that O
fine O


garden O
- O
house O
at O
Denmark B-FAC
Hill I-FAC
, O
where O
they O
lived O
, O
and O
where O
there O
were O
such O


fine O
grapes O
in O
the O
hot O

houses O
and O
peaches O
on O
the O
walls O
. O


One B-DATE
day I-DATE
they O
kindly O
came O
over O
to O
Amelia B-PERSON
with O
news O
which O
they O
were O


sure O

would O
delight O
her O
— O
something O

very O

interesting O


about O
their O
dear O
William B-PERSON
. O


 O
What O
was O
it O
: O
was O
he O
coming O
home O
? O
 O
she O
asked O
with O
pleasure O
beaming O
in O
her O


eyes O
. O


 O
O O
, O
no O
— O
not O
the O
least O
— O
but O
they O
had O
very O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
dear O


William B-PERSON
was O
about O
to O
be O
married O
— O
and O
to O
a O
relation O
of O
a O
very O
dear O
friend O
of O


Amelia’s O
— O
to O
Miss O
Glorvina B-PERSON
O’Dowd I-PERSON

Sir O
Michael B-PERSON
O’Dowd I-PERSON

sister O

who O
had O
gone O


out O

Lady O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
at O
Madras B-GPE
— O
a O
very O
beautiful O
and O
accomplished O
girl O
, O


everybody O
said O
. O
 O


Amelia B-PERSON
said O
 O
Oh O
! O
 O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
very O

very O

happy O
indeed O
. O
But O
she O


supposed O
Glorvina B-GPE
could O
not O
be O
like O
her O
old O
acquaintance O
, O
who O
was O
most O


kind O
— O
but O
— O
but O
she O
was O
very O
happy O
indeed O
. O
And O
by O
some O
impulse O
of O
which O
I O


can O
not O
explain O
the O
meaning O
, O
she O
took O
George B-PERSON
in O
her O
arms O
and O
kissed O
him O
with O


an O
extraordinary O
tenderness O
. O
Her O
eyes O
were O
quite O
moist O
when O
she O
put O
the O


child O
down O
; O
and O
she O
scarcely O
spoke O
a O
word O
during O
the O
whole O
of O
the O


drive O
— O
though O
she O
was O
so O
very O
happy O

IV O

A O
Cynical O
Chapter O


OUR O
duty O
now O
takes O
us O
back O
for O
a O
brief O
space O
to O
some O
old O
Hampshire B-GPE


acquaintances O
of O
ours O
, O
whose O
hopes O
respecting O
the O
disposal O
of O
their O
rich O


kinswoman O
’s O
property O
were O
so O
wofully O
disappointed O
. O
After O
counting O
upon O


thirty B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
from O
his O
sister O
, O
it O
was O
a O
heavy O
blow O
to O
Bute B-ORG
Crawley I-ORG


to O
receive O
but O
five B-CARDINAL
; O
out O
of O
which O
sum O
, O
when O
he O
had O
paid O
his O
own O
debts O
and O


those O
of O
Jim B-PERSON
, O
his O
son O
at O
college O
, O
a O
very O
small O
fragment O
remained O
to O
portion O


off O
his O
four B-CARDINAL
plain O
daughters O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
never O
knew O
, O
or O
at O
least O
never O


acknowledged O
, O
how O
far O
her O
own O
tyrannous O
behaviour O
had O
tended O
to O
ruin O
her O


husband O
. O
All O
that O
woman O
could O
do O
, O
she O
vowed O
and O
protested O
she O
had O
done O
. O
Was O


it O
her O
fault O
if O
she O
did O
not O
possess O
those O
sycophantic O
arts O
which O
her O


hypocritical O
nephew O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
, O
practised O
? O
She O
wished O
him O
all O
the O


happiness O
which O
he O
merited O
out O
of O
his O
ill O
- O
gotten O
gains O
. O
 O
At O
least O
the O
money O


will O
remain O
in O
the O
family O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
charitably O
. O
 O
Pitt B-PERSON
will O
never O
spend O
it O
, O


my O
dear O
, O
that O
is O
quite O
certain O
; O
for O
a O
greater O
miser O
does O
not O
exist O
in O


England B-GPE
, O
and O
he O
is O
as O
odious O
, O
though O
in O
a O
different O
way O
, O
as O
his O
spendthrift O


brother O
, O
the O
abandoned O
Rawdon B-GPE
. O
 O


So O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
, O
after O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
shock O
of O
rage O
and O
disappointment O
, O
began O
to O


accommodate O
herself O
as O
best O
she O
could O
to O
her O
altered O
fortunes O
, O
and O
to O
save O


and O
retrench O
with O
all O
her O
might O
. O
She O
instructed O
her O
daughters O
how O
to O
bear O


poverty O
cheerfully O
, O
and O
invented O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
notable O
methods O
to O
conceal O
or O


evade O
it O
. O
She O
took O
them O
about O
to O
balls O
and O
public O
places O
in O
the O


neighbourhood O
, O
with O
praiseworthy O
energy O
: O
nay O
, O
she O
entertained O
her O
friends O
in O


a O
hospitable O
comfortable O
manner O
at O
the O
Rectory O
, O
and O
much O
more O
frequently O


than O
before O
dear O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
legacy O
had O
fallen O
in O
. O
From O
her O
outward O


bearing O
nobody O
would O
have O
supposed O
that O
the O
family O
had O
been O
disappointed O
in O


their O
expectations O
: O
or O
have O
guessed O
from O
her O
frequent O
appearance O
in O
public O


how O
she O
pinched O
and O
starved O
at O
home O
. O
Her O
girls O
had O
more O
milliners O
’ O
furniture O


than O
they O
had O
ever O
enjoyed O
before O
. O
They O
appeared O
perseveringly O
at O
the O


Winchester B-PERSON
and O
Southampton B-GPE
assemblies O
; O
they O
penetrated O
to O
Cowes B-PRODUCT
for O
the O


race O
- O
balls O
and O
regatta O
- O
gaieties O
there O
; O
and O
their O
carriage O
, O
with O
the O
horses O


taken O
from O
the O
plough O
, O
was O
at O
work O
perpetually O
, O
until O
it O
began O
almost O
to O
be O


believed O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
sisters O
had O
had O
fortunes O
left O
them O
by O
their O
aunt O
, O


whose O
name O
the O
family O
never O
mentioned O
in O
public O
but O
with O
the O
most O
tender O


gratitude O
and O
regard O
. O
I O
know O
no O

That O

never O

it O

the O

the O

daily O
perplexities O
increased O

round O
him O

The O
horror O
of O
Pitt B-PERSON

may O
be O
imagined O
, O
as O
these O
reports O
of O
his O


father O

reached O
the O
most O
exemplary O

correct O
of O

He O


trembled O
daily B-DATE

hear O

proclaimed O

After O

It O
was O


the O

The B-ORG

tracts O

Mrs. O

one O
 O

 O


Indeed O

she O
rehearsed O
that O
exalted O

with O
great O
satisfaction O
to O


herself O
, O
and O
to O
the O
amusement O
of O
old O
Sir O

who O
chuckled O
at O
her O

would O
laugh O
by O
the B-TIME
hour I-TIME
together O
at O
her O
assumptions O
of O
dignity O


and O
imitations O
of O
genteel O

He O
swore O
it O
was O
as O
good O
as O
a O
play O
to O
see O
her O


in O
the O
character O
of O
a O
fine O

he O
made O
her O
put O

one B-CARDINAL
of O

Lady O

that O
the O

became O
her O
prodigiously O

drive O
her O
off O
that O
very O
instant O
to O
Court B-ORG
in O
a O
coach O

She O
had O
the O


ransacking O

of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
defunct O

cut O

hacked O


their O
posthumous O

so O
as O
to O
suit O
her O

And O
she O


would O
have O
liked O
to O
take O
possession O
of O
their O
jewels O

trinkets O
too O
; O
but O


the O
old O
Baronet O
had O
locked O
them O
away O
in O
his O
private O
cabinet O

nor O
could O
she O


coax O
or O
wheedle O
him O
out O
of O

And O
it O
is O
a O
fact O

that O
some O
time O
after O


she O
left O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-PERSON
a O
copy O

book O
belonging O
to O
this O
lady O

discovered O

which O
showed O
that O

learn O
the O
art O
of O


writing O
in O

Though O
the O

never O
went O
to O
the O

and O
shunned O


the O
horrid O
old O
dotard O
its O

yet O
they O
kept O
a O
strict O
knowledge O
of O
all O


that O
happened O
there O

were O
looking O
out O
every O
day O
for O
the O
catastrophe O
for O


which O
Miss B-PERSON

was O
also O
eager O

But O
fate O
intervened O
enviously O
, O
and O


prevented O
her O
from O
receiving O
the O
reward O
due O

such O
immaculate O

One B-DATE
day I-DATE
the O

surprised O
 O
her O

 O
as O
he O
jocularly O
called O
her O

seated O
at O
that O
old O

in O
the O
drawing O

which O
had O


scarcely O

since O
Becky B-PERSON

played O
quadrilles O
upon O

— O
seated O
at O


the O

with O
the O

gravity O

and O
squalling O
to O
the O
best O
of O
her O
power O
in O


imitation O
of O
the O
music O
which O
she O
had O
sometimes O
heard O
. O
The O
little O


kitchen O

wagging O

This O
incident O
made O
the O
old O
Baronet O
roar O
with O
laughter O
, O
as O
usual O
. O
He O


narrated O
the O
circumstance O
a B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
times O
to O

in O
the O
course O
of O
the O


evening B-TIME
, O
and O
greatly O
to O
the O
discomfiture O
of O
Miss B-PERSON
Horrocks I-PERSON

He O
thrummed O
on O


the O
table O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
a O
musical O
instrument O
, O
and O
squalled O
in O
imitation O


of O
her O
manner O
of O
singing O
. O
He O
vowed O
that O
such O
a O
beautiful O
voice O
ought O
to O
be O


cultivated O
, O
and O
declared O
she O
ought O
to O
have O
singing O

masters O
, O
in O
which O


proposals O
she O
saw O
nothing O
ridiculous O
. O
He O
was O
in O
great O
spirits O
that O
night O
; O


and O
drank O
with O
his O

an O
extraordinary O
quantity O

— O
at O
a B-TIME

the O

his O

Half B-TIME

afterwards O
there O
was O
a O

Presently O

And O
in O
another B-TIME

She O
dropped O

flashed O
out O

With O
the B-TIME
early I-TIME
morning I-TIME
an O
express O
was O
sent O
off O
to O
Mr. O

Crawley I-PERSON
by O
the O


Rector B-PERSON

lady O
, O
who O
assumed O
the O
command O
of O
everything O
, O

had O
watched O
the O


old O
Baronet O
through O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME

He O
had O
been O
brought O
back O
to O
a O
sort O
of O
life O
; O


he O
could O
not O
speak O
, O
but O
seemed O
to O
recognise O
people O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
kept O


resolutely O
by O
his O
bed O
- O
side O
. O
She O
never O
seemed O
to O
want O
to O
sleep O
, O
that O
little O


woman O
, O
and O
did O
not O
close O
her O
fiery O
black O
eyes O
once O
, O
though O
the O
Doctor O
snored O


in O
the O
armchair O
. O
Horrocks O
made O
some O
wild O
efforts O
to O
assert O
his O
authority O
and O


assist O
his O
master O
; O
but O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
called O
him O
a O
tipsy O
old O
wretch O
, O
and O
bade O
him O


never O
show O
his O
face O
again O
in O
that O
house O
, O
or O
he O
should O
be O
transported O
like O


his O
abominable O
daughter O

Terrified O
by O
her O
manner O
, O
he O
slunk O
down O
to O
the O
oak O
parlour O
where O
Mr. O
James B-PERSON


was O
, O
who O
, O
having O
tried O
the O
bottle O
standing O
there O
and O
found O
no O
liquor O
in O
it O
, O


ordered O
Mr. O
Horrocks B-PERSON
to O
get O
another O
bottle O
of O
rum O
, O
which O
he O
fetched O
, O
with O


clean O
glasses O
, O
and O
to O
which O
the O
Rector O
and O
his O
son O
sat O
down O
: O
ordering O


Horrocks O
to O
put O
down O
the O
keys O
at O
that O
instant O

never O

show O
his O

again O

Cowed B-PRODUCT
by O
this O
behaviour O
, O
Horrocks O
gave O
up O
the O

he O

his O

slunk O
off O
silently O
through O
the B-TIME

THE O

in O

after O
this O
catastrophe O

and O


henceforth O
may O
be O
said O

For O

he O
never O
recovered O
the O
use O

his O


intellect O

his O

completely O

and O
the O

devolved O
upon O
his O

In O
a O
strange O
condition O
Pitt B-PERSON
found O
it O
. O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON


was O
always O
buying O

he O

twenty B-CARDINAL

quarrels O

To O


unravel O
these O
difficulties O
, O
and O
to O
set O
the O

clear O
, O
was O
a O
task O
worthy O


of O
the O
orderly O
and O
persevering O
diplomatist O
of O
Pumpernickel O
: O
and O
he O
set O


himself O
to O
work O
with O
prodigious O
assiduity O

His O
whole O
family O
, O
of O

was O


transported O

Queen O

whither O
Lady B-PERSON

of O

came O
too O
; O


and O
she O
set O
about O
converting O
the O
parish O
under O
the O
Rector O

nose O
, O
and O
brought O


down O
her O
irregular O
clergy O
to O
the O
dismay O
of O
the O
angry O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON

Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
had O


concluded O
no O
bargain O
for O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
living O
of O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-PERSON
; O
when O
it O


should O
drop O

her O

proposed O
to O
take O
the O
patronage O
into O
her O
own O
hands O

and O
present O
a O
young O
protégé O
to O
the O
Rectory O

on O
which O
subject O
the O
diplomatic O


Pitt B-PERSON
said O
nothing O

Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
’s O
intentions O
with O
regard O
to O
Miss O
Betsy B-PERSON
Horrocks I-PERSON
were O
not O
carried O


into O

: O
and O
she O
paid O
no O
visit O
to O
Southampton B-FAC
Gaol I-FAC

She O
and O
her O
father O


left O
the O

when O
the O

took O
possession O
of O
the B-ORG
Crawley I-ORG
Arms I-ORG
in O
the O


village O
, O
of O
which O
he O
had O
got O
a O
lease O
from O
Sir O

The O
ex O

had O


obtained O
a O
small O
freehold O
there O
likewise O
, O
which O
gave O
him O
a O
vote O
for O
the O


borough O

The O
Rector O
had O
another O
of O
these O

and O
these O
and O
four B-CARDINAL

formed O
the O
representative O
body O
which O
returned O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
members O
for O
Queen B-PERSON

There O
was O
a O

up O
between O

between O
the O

gradually O
ceased O

Her O

kept O
her O
room O
when O
the O
ladies O
from O
the O
Rectory O
visited O
their O


cousins O
at O
the O
Hall B-FAC

Perhaps O
Mr. O

was O
not O
very O
much O
displeased O
at O
these O


occasional O
absences O
of O
his O
mamma O

in O

He O
believed O
the O

the O
greatest O

most O
interesting O
in O

her O

his O
aunt O

long O

ascendency O

him O

sometimes O
he O
felt O
that O


she O
commanded O
him O

to O
her O

She O
was O


only O
fond O

In O
a O
word O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
having O
come O
to O
his O
kingdom O
, O
and O
having O
by O
good O
luck O
, O
or O


desert O
rather O
, O
as O
he O
considered O
, O
assumed O
almost O
all O
the O
fortune O
which O
his O


other O
relatives O
had O
expected O

was O
determined O
to O
treat O
his O

kindly O

respectably O
, O
and O
make O
a O
house O
of O
Queen B-PERSON

Crawley B-PERSON
once O
more O
. O
It O
pleased O
him O


to O
think O
that O
he O
should O
be O
its O
chief O
. O
He O
proposed O
to O
use O
the O
vast O
influence O


that O
his O
commanding O
talents O
and O
position O
must O
speedily O
acquire O
for O
him O
in O


the O
county O
to O
get O
his O
brother O
placed O
and O
his O
cousins O
decently O
provided O
for O
, O


and O
perhaps O
had O
a O
little O
sting O
of O
repentance O
as O
he O
thought O
that O
he O
was O
the O


proprietor O
of O
all O
that O
they O
had O
hoped O
for O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
or O
four O


days O
’ O
reign O
his O
bearing O
was O
changed O
, O
and O
his O
plans O
quite O
fixed O
: O
he O


determined O
to O
rule O
justly O

honestly O
, O
to O
depose O
Lady B-PERSON

to O
be O


on O
the O
friendliest O
possible O
terms O
with O
all O
the O
relations O
of O
his O
blood O

So O
he O
dictated O
a O
letter O
to O
his O
brother O
Rawdon B-PERSON
— O
a O
solemn O
and O
elaborate O


letter O
, O
containing O
the O
profoundest O
observations O
, O
couched O
in O
the O
longest O


words O
, O
and O
filling O
with O
wonder O
the O
simple O
little O
secretary O
, O
who O
wrote O
under O


her O
husband O

order O
. O
 O
What O
an O

 O
thought O

, O
 O
when O

enters O

( O
on O
which O
point O
, O

on O
the O

of O
Lady O


Southdown B-GPE
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
had O
sometimes O
dropped O
hints O
to O
his O

; O
 O
how O
wise O


and O
good O
, O
and O
what O
a O
genius O
my O
husband O
is O
! O
I O
fancied O
him O
a O
little O
cold O
; O
but O


how O
good O
, O
and O
what O
a O
genius O
! O
 O


The O
fact O
is O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
had O
got O
every O
word O
of O
the O
letter O
by O
heart O
and O
had O


studied O
it O

with O
diplomatic O
secrecy O
, O
deeply O

perfectly O
, O
long O
before O
he O


thought O
fit O
to O

it O
to O
his O
astonished O
wife O

This O
letter O
, O
with O
a O
huge O
black O

Rawdon B-PERSON

 O
Oh O

Mr. O

had O
very O

he O
ratted O

 O
Miss O

, O
our O

was O
glad O
when O
Lord O

her O
to O

Mr. O

agreeable O

being O
a O

good O

having O
a O

she O
pulled O
up O

gave O
the O

recovered O
from O

shock O
of O
seeing O
an O
old O

. O


Briggs B-PERSON
cried O
, O
and O
Becky B-PERSON
laughed O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
kissed O
the O
gentlewoman O
as O


soon O
as O
they O
got O
into O
the O
passage O
; O
and O
thence O
into O
Mrs. O

front O


parlour O

 O


Briggs B-PERSON
told O
all O
her O
history O
amidst O
those O
perfectly O
uncalled O
- O
for O
sobs O
and O


ejaculations O
of O
wonder O
with O
which O
women O
of O
her O
soft O
nature O
salute O
an O
old O


acquaintance O
, O
or O
regard O
a O

in O

for O
though O

some O

even O

they O
have O

cry O


when O
they O
meet O
, O
deploring O

remembering O
the O
time O
when O
they O

quarrelled O

So O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
Briggs B-PERSON
told O
all O
her O
history O
, O
and O
Becky B-PERSON
gave O
a O


narrative O
of O
her O

, O
with O
her O
usual O
artlessness O
and O
candour O
. O


Mrs. O

, O
late O
Firkin B-PERSON
, O
came O
and O
listened O
grimly O
in O
the O
passage O
to O
the O


hysterical O
sniffling O
and O
giggling O
which O
went O
on O
in O
the O
front O
parlour O
. O
Becky B-PERSON


had O
never O
been O
a O
favourite O
of O

. O
Since O
the O

his O

when O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
issued O
from O
the O
parlour O
, O
only O
saluted O
the O
lady O
with O
a O
very O


sour O
curtsey O
; O
and O
her O
fingers O
were O
like O
so O
many O
sausages O
, O
cold O
and O
lifeless O
, O


when O
she O
held O
them O
out O
in O
deference O
to O
Mrs. O

, O
who O
persisted O
in O
shaking O


hands O
with O
the O
retired O

. O
She O
whirled O
away O
into O
Piccadilly B-GPE
, O


nodding O
with O
the O
sweetest O
of O
smiles O
towards O
Miss O

, O
who O
hung O
nodding O
at O


the O
window O
close O
under O
the O

at O
the O
next O

a B-CARDINAL

When O

found O

how O

a O
snug O
legacy O


from O

no O
object O
to O
our O
gentlewoman O

Becky B-PERSON
instantly O


formed O
some O
benevolent O
little O
domestic O
plans O
concerning O
her O

This O
was O
just O


such O
a O
companion O
as O
would O
suit O
her O
establishment O

and O
she O
invited O
Briggs B-PERSON
to O


come O
to O
dinner O
with O
her O
that O
very O
evening O
, O
when O
she O
should O
see O
Becky B-PERSON

dear O


little O

Rawdon B-PERSON

Mrs. O

Briggs B-PERSON
promised O
to O
be O
very O
cautious O

The O
upshot O
of O
which O
caution O


was O
that O

went O
to O

the B-DATE

Rawdon B-PERSON

but O


his O
grief O
forbade O
him O

He O
sat O
by O
the O

talked O
about O

the O

by O

Becky B-PERSON
bowed O

saluted O

recognised O
people O
here O
and O
there O
graciously O
. O
These O
recognitions O
were O


inexpressibly O
pleasant O
to O
her O
. O
It O
seemed O
as O
if O
she O
was O
not O
an O
impostor O
any O


more O
, O
and O
was O
coming O
to O
the O
home O
of O
her O

. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
rather O


abashed O
, O
and O
cast O
down O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
. O
What O
recollections O
of O
boyhood O
and O


innocence O
might O
have O
been O
flitting O
across O
his O

? O
What O
pangs O

shame O
? O


 O
Your O

must O
be O
young O

 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
said O
, O
thinking O
of O
those O


girls O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

perhaps O
since O

a B-CARDINAL

when O
I O

a O

 O


They O
were O
going O
through O
the O
lodge O

gates O
kept O
by O
old O
Mrs. O
Lock B-PERSON
, O
whose O
hand O


Rebecca B-PERSON
insisted O
upon O
shaking O
, O
as O
she O
flung O
open O
the O
creaking O
old O
iron O
gate O
, O


and O
the O
carriage O
passed O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL

 O
The O

 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
said O
, O
looking O
about O
, O
and O


then O
was O
silent O
— O
so O
was O
Becky B-PERSON
. O
Both O
of O
them O
were O
rather O
agitated O
, O
and O


thinking O
of O
old O
times O
. O
He O
about O
Eton B-ORG
, O
and O
his O
mother O
, O
whom O
he O
remembered O
, O
a O


frigid O
demure O
woman O
, O
and O
a O
sister O
who O
died O
, O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
passionately O


fond O
; O
and O
how O
he O
used O
to O
thrash O
Pitt B-PERSON
; O
and O
about O
little O
Rawdy B-PERSON
at O
home O
. O
And O


Rebecca B-PERSON
thought O
about O
her O
own O
youth O
, O
and O
the O
dark O
secrets O
of O
those O
early O


tainted O
days O
; O
and O
of O
her O
entrance O
into O
life O
by O
yonder O
gates O
; O
and O
of O
Miss O


Pinkerton B-PERSON
, O
and O
Joe B-PERSON
, O
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
. O


The O
gravel O
walk O

had O
been O
scraped O
quite O
clean O
. O
A O
grand O
painted O


hatchment B-PERSON
was O
already O
over O
the O
great O
entrance O
, O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
very O
solemn O
and O
tall O


personages O
in O
black O
flung O
open O
each O
a O
leaf O
of O
the O
door O
as O
the O
carriage O


pulled O
up O
at O
the O
familiar O
steps O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
turned O
red O
, O
and O
Becky B-PERSON
somewhat O
pale O
, O


as O
they O
passed O
through O
the O
old O
hall O
, O
arm O
in O
arm O
. O
She O
pinched O
her O
husband O
’s O


arm O
as O
they O
entered O
the O
oak O
parlour O
, O
where O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
were O
ready O


to O
receive O
them O
. O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
in O
black O
, O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
in O
black O
, O
and O
my O
Lady O


Southdown B-GPE
with O
a O
large O
black O
head O
piece O
of O
bugles O
and O
feathers O
, O
which O
waved O


on O
her O
Ladyship O
’s O
head O
like O
an O
undertaker O
’s O
tray O
. O


Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
had O
judged O
correctly O
, O
that O
she O
would O
not O
quit O
the O
premises O
. O
She O


contented O
herself O
by O
preserving O
a O
solemn O
and O
stony O
silence O
, O
when O
in O
company O


of O
Pitt B-PERSON
and O
his O
rebellious O
wife O
, O
and O
by O
frightening O
the O
children O
in O
the O


nursery O
by O
the O
ghastly O
gloom O
of O
her O
demeanour O
. O
Only O
a O
very O
faint O
bending O
of O


the O
head O
- O
dress O
and O
plumes O
welcomed O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
, O
as O
those O
prodigals O


returned O
to O
their O
family O
. O


To O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
they O
were O
not O
affected O
very O
much O
one O
way O
or O
other O
by O
this O


coolness O
. O
Her O
Ladyship O
was O
a O
person O
only O
of O
secondary O
consideration O
in O
their O


minds O
just O
then O
— O
they O
were O
intent O
upon O
the O
reception O
which O
the O
reigning O


brother O
and O
sister O
would O
afford O
them O
. O


Pitt B-PERSON
, O
with O
rather O
a O
heightened O
colour O
, O
went O
up O
and O
shook O
his O
brother O
by O
the O


hand O
; O
and O
saluted O
Rebecca B-PERSON
with O
a O
handshake O
and O
a O
very O
low O
bow O
. O
But O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON


took O
both O
the O
hands O
of O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
kissed O
her O
affectionately O
. O
The O


embrace O
somehow O
brought O
tears O
into O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
little O
adventuress O
— O
which O


ornaments O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
she O
wore O
very O
seldom O
. O


The O
artless O
mark O
of O
kindness O
and O
confidence O
touched O
and O
pleased O
her O
; O
and O


Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
encouraged O
by O
this O
demonstration O
on O
his O
sister O
’s O
part O
, O
twirled O
up O


his O
mustachios O
, O
and O
took O
leave O
to O
salute O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
with O
a O
kiss O
, O
which O
caused O


her O
Ladyship O
to O
blush O
exceedingly O
. O


 O
Dev’lish B-LANGUAGE
nice O
little O
woman O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Jane I-PERSON
, O
 O
was O
his O
verdict O
, O
when O
he O
and O
his O


wife O
were O
together O
again O
. O
 O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
got O
fat O
, O
too O
, O
and O
is O
doing O
the O
thing O


handsomely O
. O
 O
 O
He O
can O
afford O
it O
, O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
and O
agreed O
in O
her O
husband O
’s O


farther O
opinion O
, O
 O
that O
the O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
a O
tremendous O
old O
Guy B-PERSON
— O
and O
that O


the O
sisters O
were O
rather O
well O
- O
looking O
young O
women O
. O
 O


They O
, O
too O
, O
had O
been O
summoned O
from O
school O
to O
attend O
the O
funeral O
ceremonies O
. O


It O
seemed O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
, O
for O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
house O
and O
family O
, O
had O


thought O
right O
to O
have O

these O

mute O

having O
nothing O

With O
regard O
to O
her O
sisters O
- O
in O

law O
Rebecca B-PERSON
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
forget O
her O


former O
position O
of O
Governess O
towards O
them O
, O
but O
recalled O
it O
frankly O
and O


kindly O
, O
and O
asked O
them O
about O
their O
studies O
with O
great O
gravity O
, O
and O
told O
them O


that O
she O
had O
thought O
of O
them O
many O
and O
many O
a O
day O
, O
and O
longed O
to O
know O
of O


their O
welfare O
. O
In O
fact O
you O
would O
have O
supposed O
that O
ever O
since O
she O
had O
left O


them O
she O
had O
not O
ceased O
to O
keep O
them O
uppermost O
in O
her O
thoughts O
, O
and O
to O
take O


the O
tenderest O
interest O
in O
their O
welfare O
. O
So O
supposed O
Lady O
Crawley B-PERSON
herself O


and O
her O
young O
sisters O
. O


 O
She O
’s O
hardly O
changed O
since O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
 O
said O
Miss O
Rosalind B-PERSON
to O
Miss O


Violet B-PERSON
, O
as O
they O
were O
preparing O
for O
dinner O
. O


 O
Those O
red O

look O
wonderfully O
well O
, O
 O
replied O
the O
other O
. O


 O
Hers O
is O
much O
darker O
than O
it O
was O
; O
I O
think O
she O
must O
dye O
it O
, O
 O
Miss O
Rosalind B-PERSON


added O
. O
 O
She O
is O
stouter O
, O
too O
, O
and O
altogether O
improved O
, O
 O
continued O
Miss O


Rosalind B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
disposed O
to O
be O
very O
fat O
. O


 O
At O
least O
she O
gives O
herself O
no O
airs O
, O
and O
remembers O
that O
she O
was O
our O


Governess B-PERSON
once O
, O
 O
Miss O
Violet B-PERSON
said O
, O
intimating O
that O
it O
befitted O
all O


governesses O
to O
keep O
their O
proper O
place O
, O
and O
forgetting O
altogether O
that O
she O


was O
granddaughter O
not O
only O
of O
Sir O
Walpole B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
, O
but O
of O
Mr. O
Dawson B-PERSON


Mudbury B-GPE
, O
and O
so O
had O
a O
coal O

scuttle O
in O
her O
scutcheon O

There O
are O
other O
very O


well O

meaning O

Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG

who O
are O
surely O


equally O

. O


 O
It O
ca O
n’t O
be O
true O
what O
the O
girls O
at O
the O
Rectory B-PERSON
said O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
was O


an O
opera O
- O
dancer O
— O
 O


 O
A O
person O
ca O
n’t O
help O
their O

, O
 O
Rosalind B-PERSON
replied O
with O
great O
liberality O
. O


 O
And O
I O
agree O
with O
our O
brother O
, O
that O
as O
she O
is O
in O
the O
family O
, O
of O
course O
we O


are O
bound O
to O
notice O
her O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
Aunt B-WORK_OF_ART

not O

: O
she O
wants O
to O


marry O
Kate B-PERSON
to O
young O
Hooper B-PERSON
, O
the O
wine O

, O
and O
absolutely O
asked O
him O
to O


come O
to O
the O
Rectory O
for O
orders O
. O
 O


 O
I O
wonder O
whether O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown I-PERSON
will O
go O
away O
; O
she O
looked O
very O
glum O
upon O


Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON

 O

But O
before O

 O
What O

 O

 O
would O
be O
to O

see O
your O

 O
On O

went O
to O

Becky B-PERSON

the O
most O

 O
I O

 O
Lady O

with O
a O
sigh O

 O
I O
often O

we O

all O

 O
And O


then O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON

her O

one B-CARDINAL

Fifty B-DATE

and O
when O
the O

being O
an O

little O
boy O
, O
was O
ordered O
out O
of O
the O

with O
the O
ladies O
after O
dinner O
, O
I O
remember O
quite O
well O
that O
their O
talk O
was O


chiefly O
about O
their O
ailments O
; O
and O
putting O
this O
question O
directly O
to O
two B-CARDINAL
or O


three O
since O

I O
have O
always O
got O
from O
them O
the O
acknowledgment O
that O

not O

Let O
my O
fair O

remark O
for O
themselves O
this O
very O
evening O


when O

quit O

Becky B-PERSON

friends O
— O
and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
her O
Ladyship O
informed O
Sir O

that O


she O
thought O
her O

was O
a O
kind O

And O
so O

easily O

the O

the O

As O
soon O
as O
she O


found O
her O
Ladyship O
alone O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
attacked O
her O
on O
the O
nursery O
question O
at O


once O
, O
and O
said O
that O
her O

was O
saved O

actually O
saved O

by O


calomel O

freely O

of O

the O
Reverend O

Minister O

the O

in O
May B-DATE
Fair I-DATE

; O
and O
how O
her O
views O
were O
very O


much O
changed O
by O
circumstances O

misfortunes O
; O
and O
how O
she O
hoped O
that O
a O
past O


life O
spent O
in O
worldliness O
and O
error O
might O
not O
incapacitate O
her O
from O

more O


serious O

thought O
for O
the O

She O
described O
how O
in O
former B-DATE
days I-DATE


she O
had O
been O
indebted O
to O
Mr. O

religious O
instruction O

But O
she O
crowned O
all O

confirmed O
herself O
in O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown I-PERSON

favour O

by O


feeling O
very O
much O
agitated O

unwell O
after O
the O

requesting O
her O

medical O

the O

looking O
more O

first O
accepted O
the O

the O

a O
conversation O
concerning O

the O

by O
which O

she O
hoped O

But O
after O

Lady B-PERSON

to O
swallow O
the O

under O
the O
unyielding O
old O

who O


left O
her O

with O
a O

It O
did O
not O

Mrs. O

her O

queer O
when O

his O

Sir O

remembered O
the O

Rebecca B-PERSON

ill O

Rawdon B-PERSON
very O
much O

that O
was O
clear O
from O
the O

had O
it O
not O
been O
a O
lucky O

as O
regarded O
Pitt B-PERSON
himself O
? O
The O


cunning O
diplomatist O
smiled O
inwardly O
as O
he O
owned O
that O
he O
owed O
his O
fortune O
to O


it O

and O
acknowledged O
that O
he O
at O

ought O
not O
to O
cry O
out O

His O


satisfaction O
was O
not O
removed O
by O
Rebecca B-PERSON

She O
doubled O
the O

him O

calling O
out O
his O

in O
such O
a O
manner O

quite O
to O

Pitt B-PERSON
himself O
, O


who O
, O
always O
inclined O
to O
respect O
his O

admired O

them O
out O

With O
her O

Rebecca B-PERSON

that O
it O

Mrs. O

brought O


about O
the O

she O

so O
caluminated O

comparatively O

for O
she O
forgot O
the O

she O
remembered O
her O
thoughts O

seven B-DATE

contrasted O
them O

those O
which O

 O
I O
have O
passed O

 O
Becky B-PERSON
thought O

 O

almost O
all O
the O

But O
am O
I O
much O

Heigho B-ORG

I O
wish O
I O
could O


exchange O

all O

relations O
for O
a O
snug O
sum O
in O
the O


Three B-ORG
per I-ORG
Cent I-ORG
. O
Consols O
; O
 O
for O
so O
it O
was O
that O
Becky B-PERSON
felt O
the O
Vanity B-ORG
of O
human O


affairs O
, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
those O
securities O
that O
she O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
cast O


anchor O
. O


It O
may O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
struck O
her O
that O
to O
have O
been O
honest O

humble O
, O
to O


have O
done O
her O
duty O
, O
and O
to O
have O
marched O
straightforward O
on O
her O
way O
, O
would O


have O
brought O
her O
as O
near O
happiness O
as O
that O
path O
by O
which O
she O
was O
striving O
to O


attain O
it O
. O
But,—just O
as O
the O
children O
at O
Queen O
’s O
Crawley B-PERSON
went O
round O
the O
room O
, O


where O
the O
body O
of O
their O
father O
lay;—if O
ever O
Becky B-PERSON
had O
these O
thoughts O
, O
she O


was O
accustomed O
to O
walk O
round O
them O
, O
and O
not O
look O
in O
. O
She O
eluded O
them O
, O
and O


despised O
them O
— O
or O
at O
least O
she O
was O
committed O
to O
the O
other O
path O
from O
which O


retreat O
was O
now O
impossible O
. O
And O
for O
my O
part O
I O
believe O
that O
remorse O
is O
the O


least O
active O
of O
all O
a O
man O
’s O
moral O
senses O
— O
the O
very O
easiest O
to O
be O
deadened O


when O
wakened O
: O
and O
in O
some O
never O
wakened O
at O
all O
. O
We O
grieve O
at O
being O
found O


out O
, O
and O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
shame O
or O
punishment O
; O
but O
the O
mere O
sense O
of O
wrong O


makes O
very O
few O
people O
unhappy O
in O
Vanity B-ORG
Fair I-ORG
. O


So O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
during O
her O
stay O
at O
Queen B-ORG
’s I-ORG
Crawley B-GPE
, O
made O
as O
many O
friends O
of O
the O


Mammon B-PERSON
of O
Unrighteousness B-ORG
as O
she O
could O
possibly O
bring O
under O
control O
. O
Lady O


Jane B-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
bade O
her O
farewell O
with O
the O
warmest O
demonstrations O
of O


good O
- O
will O
. O
They O
looked O
forward O
with O
pleasure O
to O
the O
time O
when O
, O
the O


family O
- O
house O
in O
Gaunt B-FAC
Street I-FAC
being O
repaired O
and O
beautified O
, O
they O
were O
to O


meet O
again O
in O
London B-GPE
. O
Lady B-PERSON
Southdown I-PERSON
made O
her O
up O
a O
packet O
of O
medicine O
, O
and O


sent O
a O
letter O
by O
her O
to O
the O
Rev. O
Lawrence B-PERSON
Grills I-PERSON
, O
exhorting O
that O
gentleman O


to O
save O
the O
brand O
who O
 O
honoured O
 O
the O
letter O
from O
the O
burning O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON


accompanied O
them O
with O
four B-CARDINAL
horses O
in O
the O
carriage O
to O
Mudbury B-ORG
, O
having O
sent O
on O


their O
baggage O
in O
a O

 O
How O
happy O
you O
will O
be O
to O
see O
your O
darling O
little O
boy O
again O
! O
 O
Lady O
Crawley B-PERSON


said O
, O
taking O
leave O
of O
her O
kinswoman O
. O


 O
O O
so O
happy O
! O
 O
said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
throwing O
up O
the O
green O
eyes O
. O
She O
was O
immensely O


happy O
to O
be O
free O
of O
the O
place O
, O
and O
yet O
loth O
to O
go O
. O
Queen B-PERSON
’s O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O


abominably O
stupid O
; O
and O
yet O
the O
air O
there O
was O
somehow O
purer O
than O
that O
which O


she O
had O
been O
accustomed O
to O
breathe O
. O
Everybody O
had O
been O
dull O
, O
but O
had O
been O


kind O
in O
their O
way O
. O
 O
It O
is O
all O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
long O
course O
of O
Three B-CARDINAL
per O


Cents O
, O
 O
Becky B-PERSON
said O
to O
herself O
, O
and O
was O
right O
very O
likely O
. O


However O
, O
the O
London B-GPE
lamps O
flashed O
joyfully O
as O
the O
stage O
rolled O
into O


Piccadilly B-GPE

made O
a O
beautiful O

Which O

CONSIDERABLE O
time O
has O

our O
respectable O

old O


Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
of O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC

He O
has O
not O

the O

of O

since O


last O
we O
met O
him O

Events O
have O
occurred O
which O
have O
not O

in O
more O

he O
has O
not O
been O
allowed O
to O
have O
his O
own O
way O

To O
be O
thwarted O
in O
this O
reasonable O
desire O
was O
always O
very O
injurious O
to O
the O


old O
gentleman O
; O
and O
resistance O
became O
doubly O
exasperating O
when O
gout O
, O
age O
, O


loneliness O
, O
and O
the O
force O
of O
many O
disappointments O
combined O
to O
weigh O
him O


down O

His O
stiff O
black O
hair O
began O
to O
grow O
quite O
white O
soon O
after O
his O
son O

death O
; O
his O
face O
grew O
redder O
; O
his O
hands O
trembled O
more O

more O
as O
he O
poured O


out O
his O
glass O
of O

He O
led O
his O
clerks O
a O
dire O
life O

his O

not O

I O
doubt O
if O
Rebecca B-PERSON

piously O

dreadfully O

no O

presented O
herself O
suitable O

taste O

, O
instead O

he O
tyrannised O

not O

on O
Mr. O

George B-PERSON
being O
dead O

Frederick B-PERSON
insisted O
that O
the B-DATE

property O
should O
be O


settled O
upon O

for O

refused O

it O
was O
Mr. O

on O

Osborne B-PERSON


said O
Fred B-PERSON
had O
agreed O
to O
take O
his O
daughter O
with O
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
, O
and O
he O


should O
bind O
himself O
to O
no O
more O
. O
 O
Fred B-PERSON
might O
take O
it O
, O
and O
welcome O
, O
or O
leave O


it O
, O
and O
go O
and O
be O
hanged O
. O
 O
Fred B-PERSON
, O
whose O
hopes O
had O
been O
raised O
when O
George B-PERSON
had O


been O
disinherited O
, O
thought O
himself O
infamously O
swindled O
by O
the O
old O
merchant O
, O


and O
for O
some O
time O
made O
as O
if O
he O
would O
break O
off O
the O
match O
altogether O
. O


Osborne B-PERSON
withdrew O
his O
account O
from O
Bullock B-ORG
and O
Hulker B-PERSON
’s O
, O
went O
on O
’ O
Change O
with O


a O
horsewhip O
which O
he O
swore O
he O
would O
lay O
across O
the O
back O
of O
a O
certain O


scoundrel O
that O
should O
be O
nameless O
, O
and O
demeaned O
himself O
in O
his O
usual O
violent O


manner O
. O
Jane B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
condoled O
with O
her O
sister O
Maria B-PERSON
during O
this O
family O
feud O
. O


 O
I O
always O
told O
you O
, O
Maria B-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
was O
your O
money O
he O
loved O
, O
and O
not O
you O
, O
 O


she O
said O
, O
soothingly O
. O


‘ O
He O
selected O

me O

and O
my O
money O
at O
any O
rate O
: O
he O
did O
n’t O
choose O
you O
and O


yours O
, O
 O
replied O
Maria B-PERSON
, O
tossing O
up O
her O
head O
. O


The O
rupture O
was O
, O
however O
, O
only O
temporary O
. O
Fred B-PERSON
’s O
father O
and O
senior O
partners O


counselled O
him O
to O
take O
Maria B-PERSON
, O
even O
with O
the O
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
settled O
, O
half B-CARDINAL


down O
, O
and O
half B-CARDINAL
at O
the O
death O
of O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
chances O
of O
the O
further O


division O
of O
the O
property O

So O
he O
 O
knuckled O
down O
, O
 O
again O
to O
use O
his O
own O


phrase O
; O
and O
sent O
old O
Hulker B-NORP
with O
peaceable O
overtures O
to O
Osborne B-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
his O


father O
, O
he O
said O
, O
who O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
the O
match O
, O
and O
had O
made O
the O


difficulties O
; O
he O
was O
most O
anxious O
to O
keep O
the O
engagement O
. O
The O
excuse O
was O


sulkily O
accepted O
by O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON

Hulker B-PERSON

Bullock B-PERSON
were O
a O
high O

connected O

something O

 O
So O
he O
forgave O

for O
the O
Major O

the O

still O
hoped O

her O

Well O

although O
Lady O
O’Dowd B-PERSON

Glorvina B-PERSON
quarrelled O
a O
great O
number O
of O
times O


every O
day O

and O
upon O
almost O
every O
conceivable O
subject O
— O
indeed O
, O
if O
Mick B-PERSON

had O
not O
possessed O
the O
temper O
of O
an O
angel O
two B-CARDINAL
such O
women O
constantly O
about O
his O


ears O

have O
driven O
him O
out O

they O
agreed O
between O


themselves O
on O
this O
point O
, O
that O
Glorvina B-GPE
should O
marry O
Major O
Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
and O
were O


determined O
that O
the O
Major O
should O
have O
no O
rest O
until O
the O
arrangement O
was O


brought O
about O
. O
Undismayed O
by O
forty B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
previous O
defeats O
, O
Glorvina B-GPE
laid O


siege O
to O
him O
. O
She O
sang O
Irish B-ORG
Melodies I-ORG
at O
him O
unceasingly O
. O
She O
asked O
him O
so O


frequently O
and O
pathetically O
, O
Will O
ye O
come O
to O
the O
bower O
? O
that O
it O
is O
a O
wonder O


how O
any O
man O
of O
feeling O
could O
have O
resisted O
the O
invitation O
. O
She O
was O
never O


tired O
of O
inquiring O
, O
if O
Sorrow O
had O
his O
young O
days O
faded O
; O
and O
was O
ready O
to O


listen O
and O
weep O
like O
Desdemona B-PERSON
at O
the O
stories O
of O
his O
dangers O
and O
campaigns O
. O


It O
has O
been O
said O
that O
our O
honest O
and O
dear O
old O
friend O
used O
to O
perform O
on O
the O


flute O
in O
private O
: O
Glorvina O
insisted O
upon O
having O
duets O
with O
him O
, O
and O
Lady O


O’Dowd B-PERSON
would O
rise O
and O
artlessly O
quit O
the O
room O
, O
when O
the O
young O
couple O
were O
so O


engaged O
. O
Glorvina O
forced O
the O
Major O
to O
ride O
with O
her O
of O
mornings O
. O
The O
whole O


cantonment O
saw O
them O
set O
out O
and O
return O
. O
She O
was O
constantly O
writing O
notes O


over O
to O
him O
at O
his O
house O
, O
borrowing O
his O
books O
, O
and O
scoring O
with O
her O
great O


pencil O
- O
marks O
such O
passages O
of O
sentiment O
or O
humour O
as O
awakened O
her O
sympathy O
. O


She O
borrowed O
his O
horses O
, O
his O
servants O
, O
his O
spoons O
, O
and O
palankin;—no O
wonder O


that O
public O
rumour O
assigned O
her O
to O
him O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Major O
’s O
sisters O
in O


England B-GPE
should O
fancy O
they O
were O
about O
to O
have O
a O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O


Dobbin B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
thus O
vigorously O
besieged O
, O
was O
in O
the O
meanwhile O
in O
a O
state O


of O
the O
most O
odious O
tranquillity O
. O
He O
used O
to O
laugh O
when O
the O
young O
fellows O
of O


the O
regiment O
joked O
him O
about O
Glorvina B-PERSON
’s O
manifest O
attentions O
to O
him O
. O
 O
Bah O
! O
 O


said O
he O
, O
 O
she O
is O
only O
keeping O
her O
hand O
in O
— O
she O
practises O
upon O
me O
as O
she O
does O


upon O
Mrs. O
Tozer B-PERSON
’s O
piano O
, O
because O
it O
’s O
the O
most O
handy O
instrument O
in O
the O


station O
. O
I O
am O
much O
too O
battered O
and O
old O
for O
such O
a O
fine O
young O
lady O
as O


Glorvina B-GPE
. O
 O
And O
so O
he O
went O
on O
riding O
with O
her O
, O
and O
copying O
music O
and O
verses O


into O
her O
albums O
, O
and O
playing O
at O
chess O
with O
her O
very O
submissively O
; O
for O
it O
is O


with O
these O
simple O
amusements O
that O
some O
officers O
in O
India B-GPE
are O
accustomed O
to O


while O
away O
their O
leisure O
moments O
; O
while O
others O
of O
a O
less O
domestic O
turn O
hunt O


hogs O
, O
and O
shoot O
snipes O
, O
or O
gamble O
and O
smoke O
cheroots O
, O
and O
betake O
themselves O


to O
brandy O
- O
and O
- O
water O
. O
As O
for O
Sir O
Michael B-PERSON
O’Dowd I-PERSON
, O
though O
his O
lady O
and O
her O


sister O
both O
urged O
him O
to O
call O
upon O
the O
Major O
to O
explain O
himself O
, O
and O
not O


keep O
on O
torturing O
a O
poor O
innocent O
girl O
in O
that O
shameful O
way O
, O
the O
old O
soldier O


refused O
point O
- O
blank O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
conspiracy O
. O
 O
Faith O
, O
the O


Major B-PERSON
’s O
big O
enough O
to O
choose O
for O
himself O
, O
 O
Sir O
Michael B-PERSON
said O
; O
 O
he O
’ll O
ask O
ye O


when O
he O
wants O
ye;—or O
else O
he O
would O
turn O
the O
matter O
off O
jocularly O
, O
declaring O


that O
 O
Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
too O
young O
to O
keep O
house O
, O
and O
had O
written O
home O
to O
ask O
lave O


of O
his O
mamma O
. O
 O
Nay B-PERSON
, O
he O
went O
farther O
, O
and O
in O
private O
communications O
with O
his O


Major B-PERSON
, O
would O
caution O
and O
rally O
him O
— O
crying O
, O
 O
Mind O
your O
oi O
, O
Dob B-PERSON
, O
my O
boy O
, O
them O


girls O
is O
bent O
on O
mischief O
— O
me O
Lady O
has O
just O
got O
a O
box O
of O
gowns O
from O
Europe B-LOC
, O


and O
there O
’s O
a O
pink O
satin O
for O
Glorvina B-GPE
, O
which O
will O
finish O
ye O
, O
Dob B-PERSON
, O
if O
it O
’s O
in O


the O
power O
of O
woman O
or O
satin O
to O
move O
ye O
. O
 O


But O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
neither O
beauty O
nor O
fashion O
could O
conquer O
him O
. O
Our O
honest O


friend O
had O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
idea O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
his O
head O
, O
and O
that O
one O
did O
not O
in O
the O


least O
resemble O
Miss O
Glorvina B-PERSON
O’Dowd I-PERSON
in O
pink O
satin O
. O
A O
gentle O
little O
woman O
in O


black O
, O
with O
large O
eyes O
and O
brown O
hair O
, O
seldom O
speaking O
save O
when O
spoken O
to O
, O


and O
then O
in O
a O
voice O
not O
the O
least O
resembling O
Miss B-PERSON
Glorvina’s I-PERSON
— O
a O
soft O
young O


mother O
tending O
an O
infant O
and O
beckoning O
the O
Major O
up O
with O
a O
smile O
to O
look O
at O


him O
— O
a O
rosy O
- O
cheeked O
lass O
coming O
singing O
into O
the O
room O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
or O


hanging O
on O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
arm O
, O
happy O
and O
loving O
— O
there O
was O
but O
this O
image O


that O
filled O
our O
honest O
Major B-PERSON
’s O
mind O
by O
day O
and O
by O
night B-TIME
, O
and O
reigned O
over O
it O


always O
. O
Very O
likely O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
not O
like O
the O
portrait O
the O
Major O
had O
formed O
of O


her O
: O
there O
was O
a O
figure O
in O
a O
book O
of O
fashions O
which O
his O
sisters O
had O
in O


England B-GPE
, O
and O
with O
which O
William B-PERSON
had O
made O
away O
privately O
, O
pasting O
it O
into O
the O


lid O
of O
his O
desk O
, O
and O
fancying O
he O
saw O
some O
resemblance O
to O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON
in O
the O


print O
, O
whereas O
I O
have O
seen O
it O
, O
and O
can O
vouch O
that O
it O
is O
but O
the O
picture O
of O
a O


high O
- O
waisted O
gown O
with O
an O
impossible O
doll O
’s O
face O
simpering O
over O
it O
— O
and O
, O


perhaps O
, O
Mr. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
’s O
sentimental O
Amelia B-PERSON
was O
no O
more O
like O
the O
real O
one O
than O


this O
absurd O
little O
print O
which O
he O
cherished O
. O
But O
what O
man O
in O
love O
, O
of O
us O
, O
is O


better O
informed?—or O
is O
he O
much O
happier O
when O
he O
sees O
and O
owns O
his O
delusion O
? O


Dobbin B-PERSON
was O
under O
this O
spell O
. O
He O
did O
not O
bother O
his O
friends O
and O
the O
public O


much O
about O
his O
feelings O
, O
or O
indeed O
lose O
his O
natural O
rest O
or O
appetite O
on O


account O
of O
them O
. O
His O
head O
has O

grizzled O

since O
we O
saw O
him O
last O
; O
and O
a O


line O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
silver O
may O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
soft O
brown O
hair O
likewise O
. O
But O
his O


feelings O
are O
not O
in O
the O
least O
changed O
or O
oldened O
; O
and O
his O
love O
remains O
as O


fresh O
as O
a O
man O
’s O
recollections O
of O
boyhood O
are O
. O


We O
have O
said O
how O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
Misses B-PERSON
Dobbin I-PERSON
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
the O
Major O
’s O


correspondents O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
wrote O
him O
letters O
from O
England B-GPE
; O
Mrs. O
Osborne B-PERSON


congratulating O
him O
with O
great O
candour O
and O
cordiality O
upon O
his O
approaching O


nuptials O
with O
Miss O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
. O


 O
Your O
sister O
has O
just O
kindly O
visited O
me O
, O
 O
Amelia B-PERSON
wrote O
in O
her O
letter O
, O
 O
and O


informed O
me O
of O
an O

interesting O
event O
, O

upon O
which O
I O
beg O
to O
offer O
my O


most O
sincere O
congratulations O
. O

I O
hope O
the O
young O
lady O
to O
whom O
I O


hear O
you O
are O
to O
be O

united O

will O
in O
every O
respect O
prove O
worthy O
of O
one B-CARDINAL


who O
is O
himself O
all O
kindness O
and O
goodness O
. O
The O
poor O
widow O
has O
only O
her O


prayers O
to O
offer O
, O
and O
her O
cordial O
wishes O
for O

your O
prosperity O
! O


Georgy B-PERSON
sends O
his O
love O
to O

his O
dear O
godpapa O
, O

and O
hopes O
that O
you O
will O


not O
forget O
him O
. O
I O
tell O
him O
that O
you O
are O
about O
to O
form O

other O
ties O
, O


with O
one O
who O
I O
am O
sure O
merits O

all O
your O
affection O
, O

but O
that O
, O


although O
such O
ties O
must O
of O
course O
be O
the O
strongest O
and O
most O
sacred O
, O
and O


supersede O
all O
others O
, O

yet O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
the O
widow O
and O
the O


child O
whom O
you O
have O
ever O
protected O
and O
loved O
with O
always O

have O
a O
corner O


in O
your O
heart O
. O
 O

The O
letter O
, O
which O
has O
been O
before O
alluded O
to O
, O
went O


on O
in O
this O
strain O

protesting O
throughout O
as O
to O
the O
extreme O
satisfaction O
of O


the O
writer O
. O


This O
letter O
, O
which O
arrived O
by O
the O
very O

brought O
out O
Lady O


O’Dowd B-PERSON

box O
of O
millinery O
from O
London B-GPE

you O

Dobbin B-PERSON


opened O
before O
any O
one O
of O
the O

the O

brought O
him O

, O
put O


the O

into O
such O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
that O
Glorvina B-GPE
, O
and O
her O
pink O
satin O
, O


and O
everything O
belonging O
to O
her O
, O
became O
perfectly O
odious O
to O
him O
. O
The O
Major O


cursed O
the O
talk O
of O
women O
; O
and O
the O
sex O
in O
general O
. O
Everything O
annoyed O
him O


that B-DATE
day I-DATE
— O
the O
parade O
was O
insufferably O
hot O
and O
wearisome O
. O
Good O
heavens O
! O
was O
a O


man O
of O
intellect O
to O
waste O
his O
life O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
inspecting O
cross O

and O
putting O
fools O
through O
their O
manœuvres O
? O
The O
senseless O
chatter O
of O
the O


young O
men O
at O
mess O
was O
more O
than O
ever O
jarring O

What O
cared O
he O
, O
a O
man O
on O
the O


high O
road O
to O
forty B-CARDINAL

to O
know O
how O
many O

what O
were O
the O
performances O
of O
Ensign O
Brown B-PERSON

The O
jokes O
about O
the O

filled O
him O
with O
shame O

He O
was O
too O
old O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
banter O
of O
the O


assistant O

the O
slang O
of O

at O

old O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
, O
with O


his O
bald O
head O

red O

laughed O
quite O
easily O

The O

listened O


to O
those O

any O
time O
these B-DATE
thirty I-DATE

Dobbin B-PERSON

fifteen B-DATE

the O


quarrels O

of O

It O
was O

 O
O O
Amelia B-PERSON

Amelia B-PERSON

thought O
, O
 O
you O
to O
whom O
I O
have O
been O
so O


faithful O
— O
you O
reproach O
me O
! O
It O
is O
because O
you O
can O
not O
feel O
for O
me O

that O
I O
drag O


on O

wearisome O
life O

And O
you O

poor O
William B-PERSON

more O

He O


would O

done O
with O

its O
vanity O
altogether O
— O
so O
bootless O
and O


unsatisfactory O
the O
struggle O

so O
cheerless O

dreary O
the O

him O

He O
lay O
all O

Amelia B-PERSON

No O

down O
. O
Would O
she O
have O
pitied O
him O
had O
she O
seen O
him O
? O
He O
read O


over O
and O
over O
all O
the O
letters O
which O
he O
ever O
had O
from O
her O
— O
letters O
of O
business O


relative O
to O
the O
little O
property O
which O
he O
had O
made O
her O
believe O
her O
husband O


had O
left O
to O
her O
— O
brief O
notes O
of O
invitation O
— O
every O
scrap O
of O
writing O
that O
she O


had O
ever O
sent O
to O
him O
— O
how O
cold O
, O
how O
kind O
, O
how O
hopeless O
, O
how O
selfish O
they O


were O
! O


Had O
there O
been O
some O
kind O
gentle O
soul O
near O
at O
hand O
who O
could O
read O
and O


appreciate O
this O
silent O
generous O
heart O
, O
who O
knows O
but O
that O
the O
reign O
of O


Amelia B-PERSON
might O
have O
been O
over O
, O
and O
that O
friend O
William B-PERSON
’s O
love O
might O
have O


flowed O
into O
a O
kinder O
channel O
? O
But O
there O
was O
only O
Glorvina O
of O
the O
jetty O


ringlets O
with O
whom O
his O
intercourse O
was O
familiar O
, O
and O
this O
dashing O
young O


woman O
was O
not O
bent O
upon O
loving O
the O
Major O
, O
but O
rather O
on O
making O
the O
Major O


admire O

her O

— O
a O
most O
vain O
and O
hopeless O
task O
, O
too O
, O
at O
least O
considering O


the O
means O
that O
the O
poor O
girl O
possessed O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
. O
She O
curled O
her O
hair O


and O
showed O
her O
shoulders O
at O
him O
, O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
did O
ye O
ever O
see O
such O
jet O


ringlets O
and O
such O
a O
complexion O
? O
She O
grinned O
at O
him O
so O
that O
he O
might O
see O
that O


every O
tooth O
in O
her O
head O
was O
sound O
— O
and O
he O
never O
heeded O
all O
these O
charms O
. O
Very O


soon O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
box O
of O
millinery O
, O
and O
perhaps O
indeed O
in O
honour O


of O
it O
, O
Lady O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
and O
the O
ladies O
of O
the B-ORG
King I-ORG
’s I-ORG
Regiment I-ORG
gave O
a O
ball O
to O
the O


Company B-ORG
’s I-ORG
Regiments I-ORG
and O
the O
civilians O
at O
the O
station O
. O
Glorvina O
sported O
the O


killing O
pink O
frock O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
, O
who O
attended O
the O
party O
and O
walked O
very O


ruefully O
up O
and O
down O
the O
rooms O
, O
never O
so O
much O
as O
perceived O
the O
pink O
garment O
. O


Glorvina B-GPE
danced O
past O
him O
in O
a O
fury O
with O
all O
the O
young O
subalterns O
of O
the O


station O
, O
and O
the O
Major O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
jealous O
of O
her O
performance O
, O
or O


angry O
because O
Captain O
Bangles O
of O
the O
Cavalry O
handed O
her O
to O
supper O
. O
It O
was O


not O
jealousy O
, O
or O
frocks O
or O
shoulders O
, O
that O
could O
move O
him O
, O
and O
Glorvina B-GPE
had O


nothing O
more O
. O


So O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
were O
each O
exemplifying O
the O
Vanity B-ORG
of O
this O
life O
, O
and O
each O


longing O
for O
what O
he O
or O
she O
could O
not O
get O
. O
Glorvina O
cried O
with O
rage O
at O
the O


failure O
. O
She O
had O
set O
her O
mind O
on O
the O
Major O
 O
more O
than O
on O
any O
of O
the O
others O
, O
 O


she O
owned O

sobbing O

 O
He O
’ll O
break O
my O
heart O

he O
will O
, O
Peggy B-PERSON

 O
she O
would O


whimper O
to O
her O
sister O

in O

law O
when O
they O
were O
good O
friends O
; O
 O
sure O
every O

be O
taken O
in O

laughing O

on O

it O
was O
all O
the O

to O
the O
Major O

And O
the O
Colonel O
, O
puffing O
his O
pipe O
and O
listening O
to O
these O


complaints O
, O
would O
suggest O
that O
Glory O
should O
have O
some O
black O
frocks O
out O
in O


the O
next O
box O
from O
London B-GPE
, O
and O
told O
a O
mysterious O
story O
of O
a O
lady O
in O
Ireland B-GPE


who O
died O
of O
grief O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
her O

before O

While O
the O
Major O
was O
going O
on O
in O
this O
tantalizing O
way O
, O
not O
proposing O
, O
and O


declining O
to O
fall O
in O

there O
came O
another O

from O
Europe B-LOC
bringing O


letters O
on O

and O
amongst O
them O
some O
more O
for O
the O

These O


were O
home O
letters O
bearing O
an O
earlier O
post O

mark O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former O


packets O

and O
as O
Major O
Dobbin B-PERSON
recognised O
among O
his O
the O

of O
his O


sister O

who O
always O
crossed O

recrossed O
her O
letters O
to O
her O

together O
all O
the O

bad O

which O
she O
could O


collect O

abused O
him O

read O
him O

always O
left O

miserable O
for O
the B-DATE

achieved O


the O
perusal O

the O

not O

A O

the O

he O
was O
no O

to O


Curzon B-FAC
Street I-FAC
with O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
in O
the O
carriage O
by O
her O
side O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O


sometimes O
to O
resist O
this O
artless O
little O
creature O
’s O
hospitalities O
, O
so O
kindly O


were O
they O
pressed O
, O
so O
frankly O
and O
amiably O
offered O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
seized O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
hand O


in O
a O
transport O
of O
gratitude O
when O
he O
agreed O
to O
come O
. O
 O
Thank O
you O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O


squeezing O
it O
, O
and O
looking O
into O
the O
Baronet O
’s O
eyes O
, O
who O
blushed O
a O
good O
deal O
; O


 O
how O
happy O
this O
will O
make O
Rawdon B-PERSON
! O
 O
She O
bustled O
up O
to O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
bedroom O
, O
leading O


on O
the O
servants O
, O
who O
were O
carrying O
his O
trunks O
thither O
. O
She O
came O
in O
herself O


laughing O
, O
with O
a O
coal O
- O
scuttle O
out O
of O
her O
own O
room O
. O


A O
fire O
was O
blazing O
already O
in O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
apartment O
( O
it O
was O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON

room O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
who O
was O
sent O
upstairs O
to O
sleep O
with O
the O
maid O
) O
. O
 O
I O
knew O
I O


should O
bring O
you O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
with O
pleasure O
beaming O
in O
her O
glance O
. O
Indeed O
, O


she O
was O
really O
sincerely O
happy O
at O
having O
him O
for O
a O
guest O
. O


Becky B-PERSON
made O
Rawdon B-GPE
dine O
out O
once O
or O
twice O
on O
business O
, O
while O
Pitt B-PERSON
stayed O


with O
them O
, O
and O
the O
Baronet O
passed O
the O
happy O
evening O
alone O
with O
her O
and O


Briggs B-PERSON
. O
She O
went O
downstairs O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
actually O
cooked O
little O
dishes O


for O
him O
. O
 O
Is O
n’t O
it O
a O
good O
salmi O
? O
 O
she O
said O
; O
 O
I O
made O
it O
for O
you O
. O
I O
can O
make O


you O
better O
dishes O
than O
that O
: O
and O
will O
when O
you O
come O
to O
see O
me O
. O
 O


 O
Everything O
you O
do O
, O
you O
do O
well O
, O
 O
said O
the O
Baronet O
, O
gallantly O
. O
 O
The O
salmi O


is O
excellent O
indeed O
. O
 O


 O
A O
poor O
man O
’s O
wife O
, O
 O
Rebecca B-PERSON
replied O
, O
gaily O
, O
 O
must O
make O
herself O
useful O
, O
you O


know O
: O
 O
on O
which O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
vowed O
that O
 O
she O
was O
fit O
to O
be O
the O
wife O
of O


an O
Emperor O
, O
and O
that O
to O
be O
skillful O
in O
domestic O
duties O
was O
surely O
one O
of O
the O


most O
charming O
of O
woman O
’s O
qualities O
. O
 O
And O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
thought O
, O
with O
something O


like O
mortification O
, O
of O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
at O
home O
, O
and O
of O
a O
certain O
pie O
which O
she O
had O


insisted O
on O
making O
, O
and O
serving O
to O
him O
at O
dinner O
— O
a O
most O
abominable O
pie O
. O


Besides O
the O
salmi O
, O
which O
was O
made O
of O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
pheasants O
from O
his O


lordship O
’s O
cottage O
of O
Stillbrook O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
gave O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
a O
bottle O
of O


white O
wine O
, O
some O
that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
brought O
with O
him O
from O
France B-GPE
, O
and O
had O


picked O
up O
for O
nothing O
, O
the O
little O
story O
- O
teller O
said O
; O
whereas O
the O
liquor O
was O
, O


in O
truth O
, O
some O
White O
Hermitage O
from O
the O
Marquis B-PERSON
of O
Steyne B-ORG
’s O
famous O
cellars O
, O


which O
brought O
fire O
into O
the O
Baronet O
’s O
pallid O
cheeks O
and O
a O
glow O
into O
his O


feeble O
frame O
. O


Then O
when O
he O
had O
drunk O
up O
the O
bottle O
of O

petit O
vin O
blanc O
, O

she O
gave O


him O
her O
hand O
and O
took O
him O
up O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
, O
and O
made O
him O
snug O
on O
the O


sofa O
by O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
let O
him O
talk O
as O
she O
listened O
with O
the O
tenderest O
kindly O


interest O
, O
sitting O
by O
him O
, O
and O
hemming O
a O
shirt O
for O
her O
dear O
little O
boy O
. O


Whenever O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
wished O
to O
be O
particularly O
humble O
and O
virtuous O
, O
this O


little O
shirt O
used O
to O
come O
out O
of O
her O
work O
- O
box O
. O
It O
had O
got O
to O
be O
too O
small O


for O
Rawdon B-PERSON
long O
before O
it O
was O
finished O
. O


Well O
, O
Rebecca B-PERSON
listened O
to O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
she O
talked O
to O
him O
, O
she O
sang O
to O
him O
, O
she O


coaxed O
him O
, O
and O
cuddled O
him O
, O
so O
that O
he O
found O
himself O
more O
and O
more O
glad O


every O
day O
to O
get O
back O
from O
the O
lawyer O
’s O
at O
Gray B-ORG
’s I-ORG
Inn I-ORG
, O
to O
the O
blazing O
fire O


in O
Curzon B-FAC
Street I-FAC
— O
a O
gladness O
in O
which O
the O
men O
of O
law O
likewise O
participated O
, O


for O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
harangues O
were O
of O
the O
longest O
— O
and O
so O
that O
when O
he O
went O
away O
he O


felt O
quite O
a O
pang O
at O
departing O
. O
How O
pretty O
she O
looked O
kissing O
her O
hand O
to O


him O
from O
the O
carriage O
and O
waving O
her O
handkerchief O
when O
he O
had O
taken O
his O


place O
in O
the O
mail O
! O
She O
put O
the O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes O
once O
. O
He O
pulled O
his O


sealskin O
cap O
over O
his O
, O
as O
the O
coach O
drove O
away O
, O
and O
, O
sinking O
back O
, O
he O


thought O
to O
himself O
how O
she O
respected O
him O
and O
how O
he O
deserved O
it O
, O
and O
how O


Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
a O
foolish O
dull O
fellow O
who O
did O
n’t O
half B-CARDINAL
appreciate O
his O
wife O
: O
and O


how O
mum O
and O
stupid O
his O
own O
wife O
was O
compared O
to O
that O
brilliant O
little O
Becky B-PERSON
. O


Becky B-PERSON
had O
hinted O
every O
one O
of O
these O
things O
herself O
, O
perhaps O
, O
but O
so O


delicately O
and O
gently O
, O
that O
you O
hardly O
knew O
when O
or O
where O
. O
And O
, O
before O
they O


parted O
, O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
the O
house O
in O
London B-GPE
should O
be O
redecorated O
for O
the O


next B-DATE
season I-DATE
, O
and O
that O
the O
brothers O
’ O
families O
should O
meet O
again O
in O
the O


country O
at O
Christmas B-DATE
. O


 O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
have O
got O
a O
little O
money O
out O
of O
him O
, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
said O
to O
his O


wife O
moodily O
when O
the O
Baronet O
was O
gone O
. O
 O
I O
should O
like O
to O
give O
something O
to O


old O
Raggles O
hanged O
if O
I O
should O
n’t O
. O
It O
ai O
n’t O
right O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
the O
old O


fellow O
should O
be O
kept O
out O
of O
all O
his O
money O
. O
It O
may O
be O
inconvenient O
, O
and O
he O


might O
let O
to O
somebody O
else O
besides O
us O
, O
you O
know O
. O
 O


 O
Tell O
him O
, O
 O
said O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
 O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
affairs O
are O
settled O
, O


everybody O
will O
be O
paid O
, O
and O
give O
him O
a O
little O
something O
on O
account O
. O
Here O
’s O
a O


cheque O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON
left O
for O
the O
boy O
, O
 O
and O
she O
took O
from O
her O
bag O
and O
gave O
her O


husband O
a O
paper O
which O
his O
brother O
had O
handed O
over O
to O
her O
, O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O


little O
son O
and O
heir O
of O
the O
younger O
branch O
of O
the O
Crawleys B-PRODUCT
. O


The O
truth O
is O
, O
she O
had O
tried O
personally O
the O
ground O
on O
which O
her O
husband O


expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
she O
should O
venture O
— O
tried O
it O
ever O
so O
delicately O
, O
and O


found O
it O
unsafe O
. O
Even O
at O
a O
hint O
about O
embarrassments O
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
was O


off O
and O
alarmed O
. O
And O
he O
began O
a O
long O
speech O
, O
explaining O
how O
straitened O
he O


himself O
was O
in O
money O
matters O
; O
how O
the O
tenants O
would O
not O
pay O
; O
how O
his O


father O
’s O
affairs O
, O
and O
the O
expenses O
attendant O
upon O
the O
demise O
of O
the O
old O


gentleman O
, O
had O
involved O
him O
; O
how O
he O
wanted O
to O
pay O
off O
incumbrances O
; O
and O
how O


the O
bankers O
and O
agents O
were O
overdrawn O
; O
and O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
ended O
by O
making O
a O


compromise O
with O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
and O
giving O
her O
a O
very O
small O
sum O
for O
the O


benefit O
of O
her O
little O
boy O
. O


Pitt B-PERSON
knew O
how O
poor O
his O
brother O
and O
his O
brother O
’s O
family O
must O
be O
. O
It O
could O


not O
have O
escaped O
the O
notice O
of O
such O
a O
cool O
and O
experienced O
old O
diplomatist O
, O


that O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
family O
had O
nothing O
to O
live O
upon O
, O
and O
that O
houses O
and O
carriages O


are O
not O
to O
be O
kept O
for O
nothing O
. O
He O
knew O
very O
well O
that O
he O
was O
the O
proprietor O


or O
appropriator O
of O
the O
money O
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
all O
proper O
calculation O
, O


ought O
to O
have O
fallen O
to O
his O
younger O
brother O
, O
and O
he O
had O
, O
we O
may O
be O
sure O
, O


some O
secret O
pangs O
of O
remorse O
within O
him O
, O
which O
warned O
him O
that O
he O
ought O
to O


perform O
some O
act O
of O
justice O
, O
or O
, O
let O
us O
say O
, O
compensation O
, O
towards O
these O


disappointed O
relations O
. O
A O
just O
, O
decent O
man O
, O
not O
without O
brains O
, O
who O
said O
his O


prayers O
, O
and O
knew O
his O
catechism O
, O
and O
did O
his O
duty O
outwardly O
through O
life O
, O
he O


could O
not O
be O
otherwise O
than O
aware O
that O
something O
was O
due O
to O
his O
brother O
at O


his O
hands O
, O
and O
that O
morally O
he O
was O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
debtor O
. O


But O
, O
as O
one O
reads O
in O
the O
columns O
of O
the O

Times B-ORG

every O
now O


and O
then O
, O
queer O

the O

beg O
the O
Right O

to O
acknowledge O


through O

is O
the O

no O
doubt O

the O

likewise O
, O
always O
perfectly O
sure O
that O
the O
above O

A. B-PERSON

T. I-PERSON
are O
only O
paying O
a O

that O


the O

twenty B-QUANTITY

has O
very O
likely O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL


thousands I-CARDINAL
more O
for O
which O
he O
ought O
to O
account O
. O
Such O
, O
at O
least O
, O
are O
my O


feelings O
, O
when O
I O
see O
A. B-PERSON
B. I-PERSON
or O
W. B-PERSON
T. I-PERSON
’s I-PERSON
insufficient O
acts O
of O
repentance O
. O
And O
I O


have O
no O
doubt O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
contrition O
, O
or O
kindness O
if O
you O
will O
, O


towards O
his O
younger O
brother O
, O
by O
whom O
he O
had O
so O
much O
profited O
, O
was O
only O
a O


very O
small O
dividend O
upon O
the O
capital O
sum O
in O
which O
he O
was O
indebted O
to O
Rawdon B-PERSON
. O


Not O
everybody O
is O
willing O
to O
pay O
even O
so O
much O
. O
To O
part O
with O
money O
is O
a O


sacrifice O
beyond O
almost O
all O
men O
endowed O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
order O
. O
There O
is O


scarcely O
any O
man O
alive O
who O
does O
not O
think O
himself O
meritorious O
for O
giving O
his O


neighbour O
five B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
. O
Thriftless O
gives O
, O
not O
from O
a O
beneficent O
pleasure O
in O


giving O
, O
but O
from O
a O
lazy O
delight O
in O
spending O
. O
He O
would O
not O
deny O
himself O
one B-CARDINAL


enjoyment O
; O
not O
his O
opera O
- O
stall O
, O
not O
his O
horse O
, O
not O
his O
dinner O
, O
not O
even O
the O


pleasure O
of O
giving O
Lazarus B-PERSON
the O
five O
pounds O
. O
Thrifty O
, O
who O
is O
good O
, O
wise O
, O


just O
, O
and O
owes O
no O
man O
a O
penny O
, O
turns O
from O
a O
beggar O
, O
haggles O
with O
a O


hackney O

coachman O
, O
or O
denies O
a O
poor O
relation O
, O
and O
I O
doubt O
which O
is O
the O
most O


selfish O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
. O
Money O
has O
only O
a O
different O
value O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O


each O
. O


So O
, O
in O
a O
word O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
thought O
he O
would O
do O
something O
for O
his O
brother O
, O


and O
then O
thought O
that O
he O
would O
think O
about O
it O
some O
other O
time O
. O


And O
with O
regard O
to O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
she O
was O
not O
a O
woman O
who O
expected O
too O
much O
from O


the O
generosity O
of O
her O
neighbours O
and O
so O
was O
quite O
content O
with O
all O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON


Crawley B-PERSON
had O
done O
for O
her O
. O
She O
was O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
family O
. O
If O


Pitt B-PERSON
would O
not O
give O
her O
anything O
, O
he O
would O
get O
something O
for O
her O
some O
day O
. O


If O
she O
got O
no O
money O
from O
her O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
she O
got O
what O
was O
as O
good O
as O


money O
— O
credit O
. O
Raggles O
was O
made O
rather O
easy O
in O
his O
mind O
by O
the O
spectacle O
of O


the O
union O
between O
the O
brothers O
, O
by O
a O
small O
payment O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
and O
by O
the O


promise O
of O
a O
much O
larger O
sum O
speedily O
to O
be O
assigned O
to O
him O
. O
And O
Rebecca B-PERSON


told O
Miss B-PERSON
Briggs I-PERSON
, O
whose O
Christmas B-DATE
dividend O
upon O
the O
little O
sum O
lent O
by O
her O
, O


Becky B-PERSON
paid O
with O
an O
air O
of O
candid O
joy O
, O
and O
as O
if O
her O
exchequer O
was O
brimming O


over O
with O
gold O
— O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
we O
say O
, O
told O
Miss B-PERSON
Briggs I-PERSON
, O
in O
strict O
confidence O
, O
that O


she O
had O
conferred O
with O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
famous O
as O
a O
financier O
, O
on O
Briggs B-PERSON
’s O


special O
behalf O
, O
as O
to O
the O
most O
profitable O
investment O
of O
Miss O
B. B-PERSON
’s O
remaining O


capital O
; O
that O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
after O
much O
consideration O
, O
had O
thought O
of O
a O
most O
safe O


and O
advantageous O
way O
in O
which O
Briggs B-PERSON
could O
lay O
out O
her O

of O
the O

that O
long O
before O

recommended O
that O

be O
ready O

at O
a O

notice O

so O


as O
to O
purchase O

the O

Sir O

had O
in O

Poor O

this O
mark O
of O
Sir O


Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
attention O
— O
it O
came O
so O
unsolicited O
, O
she O
said O
, O
for O
she O
never O
should O
have O


thought O
of O
removing O
the O
money O
from O
the O
funds O
— O
and O
the O
delicacy O
enhanced O
the O


kindness O
of O
the O
office O
; O
and O
she O
promised O
to O
see O
her O
man O
of O
business O


immediately O

ready O
with O
her O
little O
cash O
at O

by O

was O
of O

His O

 O

It O
was O

increased O
to O

the O


consciousness O

her O

His O

Rawdon B-PERSON

The O

for O
little O
Rawdon B-PERSON

who O
examined O
it O
with O
the O

it O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O

There O
were O
long O

 O
Who O

 O
he O
asked O

they O
told O
him O
how O
he O
used O
to O
be O
very O


old O
, O
and O
used O
to O
be O
wheeled O
about O
in O

the O

The O

Sir O

as O

them O

they O
could O
talk O
without O
too O
much O


boring O
each O

And O
Pitt B-PERSON
took O
care O
to O
tell O
Rawdon B-PERSON
what O
a O
heavy O
outlay O
of O


money O
these O
improvements O
had O
occasioned O
: O
and O
that O
a O

 O
There O

 O
I O

no O

 O
Rawdon B-PERSON

they O

SIR O

dilapidated O


lodges O
on O
the O
Queen O

Like O
a O

set O
to O

to O


rebuild O
the O

his O

stop O
up O
the O

in O
which O
his O

left O
by O
his O
disreputable O

public O

subscribed O
handsomely O
to O
the O
county O

called O
assiduously O
upon O
all O
the O
county O

and O
laid O
himself O
out O
in O
a O
word O


to O
take O
that O
position O
in O
Hampshire B-GPE
, O
and O
in O
the O
Empire B-GPE
afterwards O
, O
to O
which O


he O
thought O
his O
prodigious O
talents O
justly O
entitled O
him O

Lady O

good O

that O
it O

clear O
Lady O

very O
seldom O


had O
a O
hand O
in O

) O
, O
and O
in O
return O
Pitt B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
most O
energetically O
dined O


out O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
weather O

at O
all O

For O
though O
Pitt B-PERSON


did O
not O
care O
for O
joviality O
, O
being O
a O
frigid O
man O
of O
poor O
health O
and O
appetite O
, O


yet O
he O
considered O
that O
to O
be O
hospitable O
and O
condescending O
was O
quite O


incumbent O
on O
his O
station O
, O
and O
every O
time O
that O
he O
got O
a O
headache O
from O
too O


long O
and O
after O

dinner O
sitting O
, O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
a O
martyr O
to O
duty O

He O


talked O
about O
crops O

corn O

laws O

with O
the O

He O


( O
who O

been O
formerly O
inclined O

be O
a O
sad O
freethinker O
on O
these O
points O

entered O
into O
poaching O

game O
preserving O
with O
ardour O

He O
did O

hunt O
: O
he O


was O
n’t O
a O
hunting O
man O
; O
he O
was O
a O
man O
of O
books O

peaceful O
habits O
: O
but O
he O


thought O
that O
the O
breed O
of O
horses O
must O
be O
kept O
up O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
that O


the O
breed O
of O
foxes O
must O
therefore O
be O
looked O
to O
, O
and O
for O
his O
part O
, O
if O
his O


friend O

Sir O

the O

of O
the O
Fuddlestone B-ORG
hunt O

And O
to O
Lady O


Southdown B-PERSON

dismay O
too O
he O
became O
more O
orthodox O
in O
his O
tendencies O
every O
day O
: O


gave O
up O
preaching O
in O
public O

attending O
meeting O

houses O
; O
went O
stoutly O
to O


Church B-ORG
; O
called O
on O
the O
Bishop B-ORG

and O
all O
the O
Clergy B-PRODUCT
at O
Winchester O
: O
and O
made O
no O


objection O
when O
the O
Venerable O
Archdeacon O
Trumper B-PERSON
asked O
for O
a O
game O
of O
whist O

What O
pangs O
must O
have O
been O
those O
of O
Lady B-PERSON

what O
an O

thought O
her O

the O

A O

three B-CARDINAL
pages O

She O

has O
no O
idea O
that O
I O
have O
commanding O
talents O
or O


secret O
ambition O
. O
So O
they O
remember O
my O
speaking O
at O
Oxford B-ORG
, O
do O
they O
? O
The O


rascals O
! O
now O
that O
I O
represent O
my O
borough O
and O
may O
sit O
for O
the O
county O
, O
they O


begin O
to O
recollect O
me O
! O
Why O
, O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
cut O
me O
at O
the O
levee O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
: O
they O


are O
beginning O
to O
find O
out O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
is O
some O
one O
at O
last O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O


man O
was O
always O
the O
same O
whom O
these O
people O
neglected O
: O
it O
was O
only O
the O


opportunity O
that O
was O
wanting O
, O
and O
I O
will O
show O
them O
now O
that O
I O
can O
speak O
and O


act O
as O
well O
as O
write O
. O
Achilles B-PERSON
did O
not O
declare O
himself O
until O
they O
gave O
him O


the O
sword O
. O
I O
hold O
it O
now O
, O
and O
the O
world O
shall O
yet O
hear O
of O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
. O
 O


Therefore O
it O
was O
that O
this O
roguish O
diplomatist O
had O
grown O
so O
hospitable O
; O


that O
he O
was O
so O
civil O
to O
oratorios O
and O
hospitals O
; O
so O
kind O
to O
Deans O
and O


Chapters O
; O
so O
generous O
in O
giving O
and O
accepting O
dinners O
; O
so O
uncommonly O


gracious O
to O
farmers O
on O
market O
- O
days O
; O
and O
so O
much O
interested O
about O
county O


business O
; O
and O
that O
the B-DATE
Christmas I-DATE
at O
the O
Hall B-FAC
was O
the O
gayest O
which O
had O
been O


known O
there O
for O
many O
a O
long O
day O
. O


On O
Christmas B-DATE

a O
great O

place O
. O
All O
the O
Crawleys B-ORG
from O


the O
Rectory B-PERSON
came O
to O
dine O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
as O
frank O
and O
fond O
of O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
, O
as O
if O


the O
other O
had O
never O
been O
her O
enemy O
; O
she O
was O
affectionately O
interested O
in O
the O


dear O
girls O

and O
surprised O
at O
the O
progress O
which O
they O
had O
made O
in O
music O
since O


her O
time O
: O
and O
insisted O
upon O
encoring O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
duets O
out O
of O
the O
great O


song O
- O
books O
which O
Jim B-PERSON

to O
bring O
under O
his O
arm O
from O


the O
Rectory O
. O
Mrs. O
Bute B-PERSON
, O
perforce O
, O
was O
obliged O
to O
adopt O
a O
decent O
demeanour O


towards O
the O
little O
adventuress O
— O
of O
course O
being O
free O
to O
discourse O
with O
her O


daughters O
afterwards O
about O
the O
absurd O
respect O
with O
which O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
treated O


his O
sister O

in O

law O
. O
But O
Jim B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
sate O
next O
to O
her O
at O

, O
declared O
she O


was O
a O
trump O
: O
and O
one O
and O
all O
of O
the O
Rector O

family O
agreed O
that O
the O
little O


Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
a O
fine O
boy O

They O
respected O
a O
possible O
baronet O
in O
the O

between O


whom O
and O
the O
title O
there O
was O
only O
the O
little O
sickly O
pale O
Pitt B-PERSON
Binkie I-PERSON

The O
children O
were O
very O
good O
friends O

Pitt B-PERSON
Binkie I-PERSON
was O
too O
little O
a O
dog O
for O


such O
a O
big O
dog O
as O
Rawdon B-PERSON
to O
play O
with O
: O
and O
Matilda B-ORG
being O
only O
a O
girl O
, O
of O


course O
not O
fit O
companion O
for O
a O
young O
gentleman O
who O
was O
near O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
old I-DATE
, O


and O
going O
into O
jackets O
very O
soon O
. O
He O
took O
the O
command O
of O
this O
small O
party O
at O


once O
— O
the O
little O
girl O
and O
the O
little O
boy O
following O
him O
about O
with O
great O


reverence O
at O
such O
times O
as O
he O
condescended O
to O
sport O
with O
them O
. O
His O
happiness O


and O
pleasure O
in O
the O
country O
were O
extreme O
. O
The O
kitchen O
garden O
pleased O
him O


hugely O
, O
the O
flowers O
moderately O
, O
but O
the O
pigeons O
and O
the O
poultry O
, O
and O
the O


stables O
when O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
visit O
them O
, O
were O
delightful O
objects O
to O
him O
. O


He O
resisted O
being O
kissed O
by O
the O
Misses O
Crawley B-PERSON
: O
but O
he O
allowed O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON


sometimes O
to O
embrace O
him O
: O
and O
it O
was O
by O
her O
side O
that O
he O
liked O
to O
sit O
when O
, O


the O
signal O
to O
retire O
to O
the O
drawing O
- O
room O
being O
given O
, O
the O
ladies O
left O
the O


gentlemen O
to O
their O
claret O
— O
by O
her O
side O
rather O
than O
by O
his O
mother O
. O
For O
Rebecca B-PERSON


seeing O
that O
tenderness O
was O
the O
fashion O
, O
called O
Rawdon B-PERSON
to O
her O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O


and O
stooped O
down O
and O
kissed O
him O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
all O
the O
ladies O
. O


He O
looked O
her O
full O
in O
the O
face O
after O
the O
operation O
, O
trembling O
and O
turning O


very O
red O
, O
as O
his O
wo O

was O
when O
moved O
. O
 O
You O
never O
kiss O
me O
at O
home O
, O
Mamma B-PERSON
, O
 O
he O


said O
; O
at O
which O
there O
was O
a O
general O
silence O
and O
consternation O
, O
and O
a O
by O
no O


means O
pleasant O
look O
in O
Becky B-PERSON
’s O
eyes O
. O


Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
fond O
of O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
for O
her O
regard O
for O
his O
son O
. O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON


and O
Becky B-PERSON
did O
not O
get O
on O

quite O

so O
well O
at O
this O
visit O
as O
on O
occasion O


of O
the O
former O
one O
, O
when O
the O
Colonel O
’s O
wife O
was O
bent O
upon O
pleasing O
. O
Those O
two B-CARDINAL


speeches O
of O
the O
child O
struck O
rather O
a O
chill O
. O
Perhaps O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
was O
rather O
too O


attentive O
to O
her O
. O


But O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
as O
became O
his O
age O
and O
size O
, O
was O
fonder O
of O
the O
society O
of O
the O


men O
than O
of O
the O
women O
; O
and O
never O
wearied O
of O
accompanying O
his O
sire O
to O
the O


stables O
, O
whither O
the O
Colonel O
retired O
to O
smoke O
his O
cigar O
— O
Jim B-PERSON

the O
Rector O

sometimes O
joining O
his O

in O
that O

He O
and O
the O


Baronet O

were O
very O
close O

their O

 O


bringing O

On O


another O
most O

these O
four B-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
partook O
of O
the O
amusement O


of O

hunting O
in O
a O

than O
which O

Rawdon B-PERSON

up O

into O
the O

openings O
of O

an O

scarcely O

listening O
motionless O
on O

to O
the O

Desperately O

Rawdon B-PERSON

from O
flurry O

on O
the O

he O
half B-CARDINAL

In O

Also O
before O
this B-DATE
merry I-DATE
Christmas I-DATE
was O
over O

the O

screwed O
up O


courage O
enough O

give O
his O

on O
his O
bankers O

and O
for O
no O


less O
a O
sum O

a O
hundred O

an O
act O
which O
caused O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
cruel O
pangs O


at O
first B-ORDINAL

but O
which O
made O
him O
glow O
afterwards O
to O
think O
himself O
one O
of O
the O


most O
generous O
of O
men O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
his O
son O
went O
away O
with O
the O
utmost O
heaviness O


of O
heart O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
and O
the O

parted O
with O
some O
alacrity O
, O
however O
: O
and O
our O


friend O
returned O
to O
London B-GPE
to O
commence O
those O
avocations O
with O
which O
we O
find O


her O
occupied O
when O

Under O
her O
care O
the B-ORG
Crawley I-ORG
House I-ORG
in O


Great B-FAC
Gaunt I-FAC
Street I-FAC
was O
quite O
rejuvenescent O
, O
and O
ready O
for O
the O
reception O
of O


Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
and O
his O
family O
, O
when O
the O
Baronet O
came O
to O
London B-GPE
to O
attend O
his O


duties O
in O
Parliament B-ORG
, O
and O
to O
assume O
that O
position O
in O
the O
country O
for O
which O


his O
vast O
genius O
fitted O
him O
. O


For O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
session O
, O
this O
profound O
dissembler O
hid O
his O
projects O
and O
never O


opened O
his O
lips O
but O
to O
present O
a O
petition O
from O
Mudbury B-ORG
. O
But O
he O
attended O


assiduously O
in O
his O
place O
, O
and O
learned O
thoroughly O
the O
routine O
and O
business O
of O


the O
House B-ORG
. O
At O
home O
he O
gave O
himself O
up O
to O
the O
perusal O
of O
Blue B-ORG
Books I-ORG
, O
to O
the O


alarm O
and O
wonder O
of O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
, O
who O
thought O
he O
was O
killing O
himself O
by O
late B-TIME


hours I-TIME
and O
intense O
application O
. O
And O
he O
made O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
ministers O
, O


and O
the O
chiefs O
of O
his O
party O
, O
determining O
to O
rank O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
before O
many O


years O
were O
over O
. O


Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
’s O
sweetness O
and O
kindness O
had O
inspired O
Rebecca B-PERSON
with O
such O
a O


contempt O
for O
her O
ladyship O
as O
the O
little O
woman O
found O
no O
small O
difficulty O
in O


concealing O
. O
That O
sort O
of O
goodness O
and O
simplicity O
which O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
possessed O
, O


annoyed O
our O
friend O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
and O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
her O
at O
times O
not O
to O


show O
, O
or O
to O
let O
the O
other O
divine O
her O
scorn O
. O
Her O
presence O
, O
too O
, O
rendered O
Lady O


Jane B-PERSON
uneasy O
. O
Her O
husband O
talked O
constantly O
with O
Becky B-PERSON
. O
Signs O
of O
intelligence O


seemed O
to O
pass O
between O
them O
: O
and O
Pitt B-PERSON
spoke O
with O
her O
on O
subjects O
on O
which O
he O


never O
thought O
of O
discoursing O
with O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
. O
The O
latter O
did O
not O
understand O


them O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
it O
was O
mortifying O
to O
remain O
silent O
; O
still O
more O


mortifying O
to O
know O
that O
you O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
, O
and O
hear O
that O
little O


audacious O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
dashing O
on O
from O
subject O
to O
subject O
, O
with O
a O
word O
for O


every O
man O
, O
and O
a O
joke O
always O
pat O
; O
and O
to O
sit O
in O
one O
’s O
own O
house O
alone O
, O
by O


the O
fireside O
, O
and O
watching O
all O
the O
men O
round O
your O
rival O
. O


In O
the O
country O
, O
when O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
was O
telling O
stories O
to O
the O
children O
, O
who O


clustered O
about O
her O
knees O
( O
little O
Rawdon B-PERSON
into O
the O
bargain O
, O
who O
was O
very O
fond O


of O
her)—and B-PERSON
Becky I-PERSON
came O
into O
the O
room O
, O
sneering O
with O
green O
scornful O
eyes O
, O


poor O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
grew O
silent O
under O
those O
baleful O
glances O
. O
Her O
simple O
little O


fancies O
shrank O
away O
tremulously O
, O
as O
fairies O
in O
the O
story O
- O
books O
, O
before O
a O


superior O
bad O
angel O
. O
She O
could O
not O
go O
on O
, O
although O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
with O
the O
smallest O


inflection O
of O
sarcasm O
in O
her O
voice O
, O
besought O
her O
to O
continue O
that O
charming O


story O
. O
And O
on O
her O
side O
gentle O
thoughts O
and O
simple O
pleasures O
were O
odious O
to O


Mrs. O
Becky B-PERSON
; O
they O
discorded O
with O
her O
; O
she O
hated O
people O
for O
liking O
them O
; O
she O


spurned O
children O
and O
children O
- O
lovers O
. O
 O
I O
have O
no O
taste O
for O
bread O
and O


butter O
, O
 O
she O
would O
say O
, O
when O
caricaturing O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
and O
her O
ways O
to O
my O
Lord O


Steyne B-PERSON
. O


 O
No O
more O
has O
a O
certain O
person O
for O
holy O
water O
, O
 O
his O
lordship O
replied O
with O
a O


bow O
and O
a O
grin O
, O
and O
a O
great O
jarring O
laugh O
afterwards O
. O


So O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
ladies O
did O
not O
see O
much O
of O
each O
other O
except O
upon O
those O


occasions O
, O
when O
the O
younger O
brother O
’s O
wife O
, O
having O
an O
object O
to O
gain O
from O


the O
other O
, O
frequented O
her O
. O
They O
my O
- O
loved O
and O
my O
- O
deared O
each O
other O


assiduously O
, O
but O
kept O
apart O
generally O
: O
whereas O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
his O


multiplied O
avocations O
, O
found O
daily B-DATE
time O
to O
see O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O


On O
the O
occasion O
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
Speaker O
’s O
dinner O
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
took O
the O


opportunity O
of O
appearing O
before O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
in O
his O
uniform O
— O
that O
old O


diplomatic O
suit O
which O
he O
had O
worn O
when O
attaché O
to O
the O
Pumpernickel O


legation O
. O


Becky B-PERSON
complimented O
him O
upon O
that O
dress O
, O
and O
admired O
him O
almost O
as O
much O
as O


his O
own O
wife O
and O
children O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
displayed O
himself O
before O
he O
set O
out O
. O


She O
said O
that O
it O
was O
only O
the O
thoroughbred O
gentleman O
who O
could O
wear O
the O


Court B-ORG
suit O
with O
advantage O
: O
it O
was O
only O
your O
men O
of O
ancient O
race O
whom O
the O


culotte O
courte O

became O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON
looked O
down O
with O
complacency O
at O
his O


legs O
, O
which O
had O
not O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
much O
more O
symmetry O
or O
swell O
than O
the O
lean O


Court B-ORG
sword O
which O
dangled O
by O
his O
side O
: O
looked O
down O
at O
his O
legs O
, O
and O
thought O


in O
his O
heart O
that O
he O
was O
killing O
. O


When O
he O
was O
gone O
, O
Mrs. O
Becky B-PERSON
made O
a O
caricature O
of O
his O
figure O
, O
which O
she O


showed O
to O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
when O
he O
arrived O
. O
His O
lordship O
carried O
off O
the O
sketch O
, O


delighted O
with O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
resemblance O
. O
He O
had O
done O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON


the O
honour O
to O
meet O
him O
at O
Mrs. O
Becky B-PERSON
’s O
house O
, O
and O
had O
been O
most O
gracious O
to O


the O
new O
Baronet O
and O
member O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON
was O
struck O
too O
by O
the O
deference O
with O
which O


the O
great O
Peer O
treated O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
by O
her O
ease O
and O
sprightliness O
in O


the O
conversation O
, O
and O
by O
the O
delight O
with O
which O
the O
other O
men O
of O
the O
party O


listened O
to O
her O
talk O
. O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
made O
no O
doubt O
but O
that O
the O
Baronet O
had O


only O
commenced O
his O
career O
in O
public O
life O
, O
and O
expected O
rather O
anxiously O
to O


hear O
him O
as O
an O
orator O
; O
as O
they O
were O
neighbours O
( O
for O
Great O
Gaunt O

into O

whereof O
Gaunt B-ORG
House I-ORG
, O
as O
everybody O
knows O

forms O
one O
side O

my O
lord O
hoped O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
Lady B-PERSON
Steyne I-PERSON
arrived O
in O
London B-GPE
she O
would O
have O


the O
honour O
of O
making O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
Lady B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
. O
He O
left O
a O
card O
upon O


his O
neighbour O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
; O
having O
never O

In O

Rawdon B-PERSON
felt O
himself O

He O
was O


allowed O
to O
go O

without O
any O

And O
he O
and O


Rawdon B-PERSON
the O

sit O
with O

on O

The O

very O
silent O

thinking O

He O
was O
beat O

cowed O
into O


laziness O

submission O
. O
Delilah B-PERSON

imprisoned O
him O

cut O
his O

The O

George B-PERSON


Osborne I-PERSON
’s O
son O
, O
and O
to O
defray O
the O
expenses O
of O
the O
little O
school O
to O
which O
, O


after O
much O
misgiving O
and O
reluctance O
, O
and O
many O
secret O
pangs O
and O
fears O
on O
her O


own O
part O
, O
she O
had O
been O
induced O
to O
send O
the O
lad O
. O
She O
had O
sate O
up O
of O
nights O


conning O
lessons O
and O
spelling O
over O
crabbed O
grammars O
and O
geography O
books O
in O


order O
to O
teach O
them O
to O
Georgy B-PERSON
. O
She O
had O
worked O
even O
at O
the O
Latin B-NORP
accidence O
, O


fondly O
hoping O
that O
she O
might O
be O
capable O
of O
instructing O
him O
in O
that O
language O
. O


To O
part O
with O
him O
all O
day O
: O
to O
send O
him O
out O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
a O
schoolmaster O
’s O


cane O
and O
his O
schoolfellows O
’ O
roughness O
, O
was O
almost O
like O
weaning O
him O
over O


again O
, O
to O
that O
weak O
mother O
, O
so O
tremulous O
and O
full O
of O
sensibility O
. O
He O
, O
for O


his O
part O
, O
rushed O
off O
to O
school O
with O
the O
utmost O
happiness O
. O
He O
was O
longing O
for O


the O
change O
. O
That O
childish O
gladness O
wounded O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
herself O
so O


grieved O
to O
part O
with O
him O
. O
She O
would O
rather O
have O
had O
him O
more O
sorry O
, O
she O


thought O
: O
and O
then O
was O
deeply O
repentant O
within O
herself O
, O
for O
daring O
to O
be O
so O


selfish O
as O
to O
wish O
her O
own O
son O
to O
be O
unhappy O
. O


Georgy B-PERSON
made O
great O
progress O
in O
the O
school O
, O
which O
was O
kept O
by O
a O
friend O
of O
his O


mother O
’s O
constant O
admirer O
, O
the O
Rev. O
Mr. O
Binny B-PERSON
. O
He O
brought O
home O
numberless O


prizes O
and O
testimonials O
of O
ability O
. O
He O
told O
his O
mother O
countless O
stories O


every B-TIME
night I-TIME
about O
his O
school O
- O
companions O
: O
and O
what O
a O
fine O
fellow O
Lyons B-PERSON
was O
, O


and O
what O
a O
sneak O
Sniffin O
was O
; O
and O
how O
Steel B-ORG
’s O
father O
actually O
supplied O
the O


meat O
for O
the O
establishment O
, O
whereas O
Golding B-PERSON
’s O
mother O
came O
in O
a O
carriage O
to O


fetch O
him O
every O
Saturday B-DATE
: O
and O
how O
Neat O
had O
straps O
to O
his O
trowsers O
— O
might O
he O


have O
straps?—and O
how O
Bull O
Major O
was O
so O
strong O
( O
though O
only O
in O
Eutropius O
) O


that O
it O
was O
believed O
he O
could O
lick O
the O
Usher O
, O
Mr. O
Ward B-PERSON
, O
himself O
. O
So O
Amelia B-PERSON


learned O
to O
know O
every O
one O
of O
the O
boys O
in O
that O
school O
as O
well O
as O
Georgy B-PERSON


himself O
: O
and O
of O
nights O
she O
used O
to O
help O
him O
in O
his O
exercises O
and O
puzzle O
her O


little O
head O
over O
his O
lessons O
as O
eagerly O
as O
if O
she O
was O
herself O
going O
in O
the O


morning B-TIME
into O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
master O
. O
Once O
, O
after O
a O
certain O
combat O
with O


Master B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
, O
George B-PERSON
came O
home O
to O
his O
mother O
with O
a O
black O
eye O
, O
and O
bragged O


prodigiously O
to O
his O
parent O
and O
his O
delighted O
old O
grandfather O
about O
his O


valour O
in O
the O
fight O
, O
in O
which O
, O
if O
the O
truth O
was O
known O
, O
he O
did O
not O
behave O


with O
particular O
heroism O
, O
and O
in O
which O
he O
decidedly O
had O
the O
worst O
. O
But O
Amelia B-PERSON


has O
never O
forgiven O
that O
Smith B-PERSON
to O
this B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
though O
he O
is O
now O
a O
peaceful O


apothecary O
near O
Leicester B-FAC
Square I-FAC
. O


In O
these O
quiet O
labours O
and O
harmless O
cares O
the O
gentle O
widow O
’s O
life O
was O


passing O
away O
, O
a O
silver O
hair O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
marking O
the O
progress O
of O

on O
her O
head O
, O


and O
a O
line O
deepening O
ever O
so O
little O
on O
her O
fair O
forehead O

She O
used O
to O
smile O


at O
these O
marks O
of O
time O
. O
 O
What O
matters O
it O
, O
 O
she O
asked O
, O
 O
for O
an O
old O
woman O
like O


me O
? O
 O
All O
she O
hoped O
for O
was O
to O
live O
to O
see O
her O
son O
great O
, O
famous O
, O
and O


glorious O
, O
as O
he O
deserved O
to O

She O
kept O
his O
copybooks O

his O
drawings O

and O


compositions O
, O
and O
showed O
them O
about O
in O
her O
little O
circle O

as O
if O
they O
were O


miracles O
of O

She O
confided O
some O
of O
these O

All O

the O
noble O

die O
gloriously O
for O

From O

We O

Her O

She O

in O
a O

 O
After O
which O
kind O
of O

in O


which O
fashion O
and O
the O
main O
chance O
were O
blended O
together O
, O
and O
after O
a O

which O
was O
like O
the O
contact O
of O
an O

— O
Mrs. O

Bullock I-PERSON
would O
gather O


her O

Every O

this O

Her O

The O

in O
the O
little O


cottage O
at O
Brompton B-GPE
, O
guarding O
her O

there O
, O
little O
knew O
how O
eagerly O


some O
people O
coveted O
it O

On O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
when O
Jane B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
had O
told O
her O
father O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
his O


grandson O
, O
the O
old O
man O
had O
made O
her O
no O
reply O
: O
but O
he O
had O
shown O
no O
anger O
— O
and O


had O
bade O
her O
good O
- O
night O
on O
going O
himself O
to O
his O
room O
in O
rather O
a O
kindly O


voice O
. O
And O
he O
must O
have O
meditated O
on O
what O
she O
said O
, O
and O
have O
made O
some O


inquiries O
of O
the O
Dobbin B-PERSON
family O
regarding O
her O
visit O
; O
for O
a O
fortnight O
after O
it O


took O
place O
, O
he O
asked O
her O
where O
was O
her O
little O
French B-NORP
watch O
and O
chain O
she O


used O
to O
wear O
? O


 O
I O
bought O
it O
with O
my O
money O
, O
sir O
, O
 O
she O
said O
in O
a O
great O
fright O
. O


 O
Go O
and O
order O
another O
like O
it O
, O
or O
a O
better O
if O
you O
can O
get O
it O
, O
 O
said O
the O
old O


gentleman O
, O
and O
lapsed O
again O
into O
silence O
. O


Of O
late O
the O
Misses O
Dobbin B-PERSON
more O
than O
once O
repeated O
their O
entreaties O
to O


Amelia B-PERSON
, O
to O
allow O
George B-PERSON
to O
visit O
them O
. O
His O
aunt O
had O
shown O
her O
inclination O
; O


perhaps O
his O
grandfather O
himself O
, O
they O
hinted O
, O
might O
be O
disposed O
to O
be O


reconciled O
to O
him O
. O
Surely O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
could O
not O
refuse O
such O
advantageous O
chances O


for O
the O
boy O
. O
Nor O
could O
she O
: O
but O
she O
acceded O
to O
their O
overtures O
with O
a O
very O


heavy O
and O
suspicious O
heart O
, O
was O
always O
uneasy O
during O
the O
child O
’s O
absence O


from O
her O
, O
and O
welcomed O
him O
back O
as O
if O
he O
was O
rescued O
out O
of O
some O
danger O
. O
He O


brought O
back O
money O
and O
toys O
, O
at O
which O
the O
widow O
looked O
with O
alarm O
and O


jealousy O
: O
she O
asked O
him O
always O
if O
he O
had O
seen O
any O
gentleman—Only O
old O
Sir O


William B-PERSON
, O
who O
drove O
him O
about O
in O
the O
four B-CARDINAL

wheeled O
chaise O

and O
Mr. O
Dobbin B-PERSON

who O


arrived O
on O
the O

in O
the O

in O

pink O

who O
promised O
to O
show O
him O
the O


Tower B-FAC
of I-FAC
London I-FAC
, O
and O
take O
him O
out O
with O
the O
Surrey B-GPE
hounds O
. O
 O
At O
last O
, O
he O
said O


 O
There O

was O

an O
old O
gentleman O
, O
with O
thick O
eye O
- O
brows O
and O
a O
broad O
hat O
, O


and O
large O
chain O
and O
seals O
. O
 O
He O
came O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
as O
the O
coachman O
was O
lunging O


Georgy B-PERSON
round O
the O
lawn O
on O
the O
gray O
pony O
. O
 O
He O
looked O
at O
me O
very O
much O
. O
He O
shook O


very O
much O
. O
I O
said O
‘ O
My O
name O
is O
Norval B-PERSON
’ O
after O
dinner O
. O
My O
aunt O
began O
to O
cry O
. O


She O
is O
always O
crying O
. O
 O
Such O
was O
George B-PERSON
’s O
report O
on O
that B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O


Then O
Amelia B-PERSON
knew O
that O
the O
boy O
had O
seen O
his O
grandfather O
: O
and O
looked O
out O


feverishly O
for O
a O
proposal O
which O
she O
was O
sure O
would O
follow O
, O
and O
which O
came O
, O


in O
fact O
, O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
afterwards O
. O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
formally O
offered O
to O
take O
the O


boy O
, O
and O
make O
him O
heir O
to O
the O
fortune O
which O
he O
had O
intended O
that O
his O
father O


should O
inherit O
. O
He O
would O
make O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
an O
allowance O
, O
such O
as O
to O


assure O
her O
a O
decent O
competency O
. O
If O
Mrs. O
George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
proposed O
to O
marry O


again O
, O
as O
Mr. O
O. B-PERSON
heard O
was O
her O
intention O
, O
he O
would O
not O
withdraw O
that O


allowance O
. O
But O
it O
must O
be O
understood O
, O
that O
the O
child O
would O
live O
entirely O


with O
his O
grandfather O
in O
Russell B-FAC
Square I-FAC
, O
or O
at O
whatever O
other O
place O
Mr. O
O. B-PERSON


should O
select O
; O
and O
that O
he O
would O
be O
occasionally O
permitted O
to O
see O
Mrs. O


George B-PERSON
Osborne I-PERSON
at O
her O
own O
residence O
. O
This O
message O
was O
brought O
or O
read O
in O
a O


letter O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
when O
her O
mother O
was O
from O
home O

and O
her O
father O
absent O
as O


usual O
in O
the O
City O
. O


She O
was O
never O
seen O
angry O
but O
twice O
or O
thrice O
in O
her O
life O
, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
one B-CARDINAL


of O
these O
moods O
that O
Mr. O
Osborne B-PERSON
’s O
attorney O
had O
the O
fortune O
to O
behold O
her O
. O


She O
rose O
up O
trembling O
and O
flushing O
very O
much O
as O
soon O
as O
, O
after O
reading O
the O


letter O
, O
Mr. O
Poe B-PERSON
handed O
it O
to O
her O
, O
and O
she O
tore O
the O
paper O
into O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL


fragments O
, O
which O
she O
trod O
on O

with O
a O

The O

The O

the O
poor O

the O
poor O

Sometimes O
he O
laughed O
at O
her O

his O


laughter O
was O
more O
pitiful O

; O
sometimes O
she O
found O
the O

he O

cry O

his O

It O
was O
the O
mysterious O

the O
poor O

brought O
it O


from O

The O

The O
pride O

struck O
down O

The O
dark O

The O

First B-ORDINAL

Becky B-PERSON

Even O
our O

her O

often O

how O

themselves O

how O

, O
Comus B-ORG

that O
he O
is O
the O

how O

not O
a O

a O

while O
Robinson B-PERSON

not O
in O

care O

We O

there O

that O
it O

She O
walked O

a O

A O
score O
of O

hence O
that O
too O

that O
milliner O

wonder O

will O
have O
passed O
into O
the O

along O

all O
previous O


vanities O

But O
we O
are O
wandering O
too O
much O

Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
dress O
was O
pronounced O


to O
be O
charmante O
on O
the B-DATE
eventful I-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
her O
presentation O
. O
Even O
good O
little O


Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
was O
forced O
to O
acknowledge O
this O
effect O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
at O
her O


kinswoman O
; O
and O
owned O
sorrowfully O
to O
herself O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
inferior O
in O


taste O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky B-PERSON
. O


She O
did O
not O
know O
how O
much O
care O
, O
thought O
, O
and O
genius O
Mrs. O
Radon B-PERSON
had O
bestowed O


upon O
that O
garment O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
as O
good O
taste O
as O
any O
milliner O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
and O


such O
a O
clever O
way O
of O
doing O
things O
as O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
little O
understood O
. O
The O
latter O


quickly O
spied O
out O
the O
magnificence O
of O
the O
brocade O
of O
Becky B-PERSON
’s O
train O
, O
and O
the O


splendour O
of O
the O
lace O
on O
her O
dress O
. O


The O
brocade O
was O
an O
old O
remnant O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
said O
; O
and O
as O
for O
the O
lace O
, O
it O
was O
a O


great O
bargain O
. O
She O
had O
had O
it O
these B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O


 O
My O
dear O
Mrs. O
Crawly B-PERSON
, O
it O
must O
have O
cost O
a O
little O
fortune O
, O
 O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
said O
, O


looking O
down O
at O
her O
own O
lace O
, O
which O
was O
not O
nearly O
so O
good O
; O
and O
then O


examining O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
ancient O
brocade O
which O
formed O
the O
material O
of O


Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O
Court B-ORG
dress O
, O
she O
felt O
inclined O
to O
say O
that O
she O
could O
not O


afford O
such O
fine O
clothing O
, O
but O
checked O
that O
speech O
, O
with O
an O
effort O
, O
as O
one B-CARDINAL


uncharitable O
to O
her O
kinswoman O
. O


And O
yet O
, O
if O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
had O
known O
all O
, O
I O
think O
even O
her O
kindly O
temper O
would O


have O
failed O
her O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
when O
she O
was O
putting O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
house O
in O


order O
, O
Mrs. O
Radon B-PERSON
had O
found O
the O
lace O
and O
the O
brocade O
in O
old O
wardrobes O
, O
the O


property O
of O
the O
former O
ladies O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
had O
quietly O
carried O
the O


goods O
home O
, O
and O
had O
suited O
them O
to O
her O
own O
little O
person O
. O
Brigs B-PERSON
saw O
her O
take O


them O
, O
asked O
no O
questions O
, O
told O
no O
stories O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
quite O
sympathized O


with O
her O
on O
this O
matter O
, O
and O
so O
would O
many O
another O
honest O
woman O
. O


And O
the O
diamonds—Where O
the O
loose O
did O
you O
get O
the O
diamonds O
, O
Becky B-PERSON
? O
 O
said O


her O
husband O
, O
admiring O
some O
jewels O
which O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
before O
, O
and O
which O


sparkled O
in O
her O
ears O
and O
on O
her O
neck O
with O
brilliance O
and O
profusion O
. O


Becky B-PERSON
blushed O
a O
little O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
him O
hard O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
Pit O
Crawly O


blushed O
a O
little O
too O
, O
and O
looked O
out O
of O
window O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
he O
had O
given O


her O
a O
very O
small O
portion O
of O
the O
brilliant O
; O
a O
pretty O
diamond O
clasp O
, O
which O


confined O
a O
pearl O
necklace O
which O
she O
wore O
; O
and O
the O
Baronet O
had O
omitted O
to O


mention O
the O
circumstances O
to O
his O
lady O
. O


Becky B-PERSON
looked O
at O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
then O
at O
Sir O
Pit O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
saucy O


triumph O
— O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
 O
Shall O
I O
betray O
you O
? O
 O


 O
Guess O
! O
 O
she O
said O
to O
her O
husband O
. O
 O
Why O
, O
you O
silly O
man O
, O
 O
she O
continued O
, O


 O
where O
do O
you O
suppose O
I O
got O
them?—all O
except O
the O
little O
clasp O
, O
which O
a O
dear O


friend O
of O
mine O
gave O
me O
long O
ago O
. O
I O
hired O
them O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
I O
hired O
them O
at O


Mr. O
Polonius B-PERSON
’s O
, O
in O
Coventry B-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O
You O
do O
n’t O
suppose O
that O
all O
the O
diamonds O


which O
go O
to O
Court B-ORG
belong O
to O
the O
wearers O
; O
like O
those O
beautiful O
stones O
which O


Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
has O
, O
and O
which O
are O
much O
handsome O
than O
any O
which O
I O
have O
, O
I O
am O


certain O
. O
 O


 O
They O
are O
family O
jewels O
, O
 O
said O
Sir O
Pit B-PERSON
, O
again O
looking O
uneasy O
. O
And O
in O
this O


family O
conversation O
the O
carriage O
rolled O
down O
the O
street O
, O
until O
its O
cargo O
was O


finally O
discharged O
at O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
palace O
where O
the O
Sovereign O
was O


sitting O
in O
state O
. O


The O
diamonds O
, O
which O
had O
created O
Radons B-PERSON
admiration O
, O
never O
went O
back O
to O
Mr. O


Polonius B-PERSON
, O
of O
Coventry B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
and O
that O
gentleman O
never O
applied O
for O
their O


restoration O
; O
but O
they O
retired O
into O
a O
little O
private O
repository O

in O
an O
old O

which O
Amelia B-PERSON

in O
which O


Becky B-PERSON
kept O
a O
number O
of O
useful O

, O
perhaps O
, O
valuable O
things O

about O
which O
her O

knew O
nothing O

As O

This O

that O
in O
all O
London B-GPE

was O
no O
more O

Becky B-PERSON

after O
this O

The O
name O

always O

and O
he O
was O
proclaimed O
by O
her O
to O
be O
the O
most O
charming O
of O
men O

She O
went O
to O


Colnaghi B-PERSON

ordered O
the O
finest O
portrait O
of O
him O
that O
art O
had O
produced O

credit O
could O
supply O

She O
chose O
that O
famous O
one O
in O
which O
the O
best O
of O

is O
represented O
in O
a O

simpering O

his O
curly O

She O
had O
him O


painted O
in O
a O
brooch O

wore O
it O
— O
indeed O
she O
amused O
and O
somewhat O
pestered O
her O


acquaintance O
with O
her O
perpetual O
talk O
about O
his O
urbanity O

Who O

Perhaps O

But O
the O
finest O
sport O
of O
all O
after O

was O
to O
hear O
her O

virtuously O

She O
had O
a O

And O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
reflecting O


on O
the O

but O
one B-CARDINAL

This O
caused O
the O
Lord O

to O
break O
out O

another O
brief O

energetic O


expression O
of O
anger O

Lord O

by O
beating O
the O

She O


burst O

on O

He O


was O
most O
indignant O
that O

the O
Earl B-PERSON

 O

 O


The O

It O

that O

On O

it O

Becky B-PERSON
took O
it O
, O
however O

with O
grateful O
humility O

performing O
a O

which O
would O

put O

in O

 O
I O

 O

The O

of O

knew O


nothing O

Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
retreated O
with O
Lord O
Southdown O
into O
a O
window O
, O
where O


the O
latter O
was O
heard O
to O
laugh O
immoderately O
, O
as O
Rawdon B-PERSON
told O
him O
the O
story O
of O


Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres I-PERSON
wanting O
horses O
, O
and O
 O
knuckling O
down O
by O
Jove B-PERSON
, O
 O
to O
Mrs. O


Crawley B-PERSON
. O
 O
I O
think O
I O
need O
n’t O
be O
afraid O
of O

that O

woman O
, O
 O
Becky B-PERSON


thought O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres I-PERSON
exchanged O
terrified O
and O
angry O
looks O
with O
her O


daughter O
, O
and O
retreated O
to O
a O
table O
, O
where O
she O
began O
to O
look O
at O
pictures O
with O


great O
energy O
. O


When O
the O
Potentate B-ORG
from O
the O
Danube O
made O
his O
appearance O
, O
the O
conversation O


was O
carried O
on O
in O
the O
French B-LANGUAGE
language O
, O
and O
the O
Lady B-PERSON
Bareacres I-PERSON
and O
the O


younger O
ladies O
found O
, O
to O
their O
farther O
mortification O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
was O


much O
better O
acquainted O
with O
that O
tongue O
, O
and O
spoke O
it O
with O
a O
much O
better O


accent O
than O
they O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
had O
met O
other O
Hungarian B-NORP
magnates O
with O
the O
army O
in O


France B-GPE
in O
1816–17 B-CARDINAL
. O
She O
asked O
after O
her O
friends O
with O
great O
interest O
. O
The O


foreign O
personages O
thought O
that O
she O
was O
a O
lady O
of O
great O
distinction O
; O
and O
the O


Prince O
and O
the O
Princess O
asked O
severally O
of O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
and O
the O
Marchioness B-ORG
, O


whom O
they O
conducted O
to O
dinner O
, O
who O
was O
that O
petite O
dame O
who O
spoke O
so O


well O
? O


Finally O
, O
the O
procession O
being O
formed O
in O
the O
order O
described O
by O
the O
American B-NORP


diplomatist O
, O
they O
marched O
into O
the O
apartment O
where O
the O
banquet O
was O
served O
: O


and O
which O
, O
as O
I O
have O
promised O
the O

he O
shall O
enjoy O
it O
, O
he O
shall O
have O


the O
liberty O
of O
ordering O
himself O
so O
as O
to O
suit O
his O
fancy O
. O


But O
it O
was O
when O
the O
ladies O
were O
alone O
that O
Becky B-PERSON
knew O
the O
tug O
of O
war O
would O


come O
. O
And O
then O
indeed O
the O
little O
woman O
found O
herself O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
as O


made O
her O
acknowledge O
the O
correctness O
of O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
caution O
to O
her O
to O


beware O
of O
the O
society O
of O
ladies O
above O
her O
own O
sphere O
. O
As O
they O
say O
the O


persons O
who O
hate O
Irishmen B-NORP
most O
are O
Irishmen B-NORP
; O
so O
, O
assuredly O
, O
the O
greatest O


tyrants O
over O
women O
are O
women O
. O
When O
poor O
little O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
alone O
with O
the O
ladies O
, O


went O
up O
to O
the O
fire O
- O
place O
whither O
the O
great O
ladies O
had O
repaired O
, O
the O
great O


ladies O
marched O
away O
and O
took O
possession O
of O
a O
table O
of O
drawings O
. O
When O
Becky B-PERSON


followed O
them O
to O
the O
table O
of O
drawings O
, O
they O
dropped O
off O
one B-CARDINAL
by O
one B-CARDINAL
to O
the O


fire O
again O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
speak O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
children O
( O
of O
whom O
she O
was O


commonly O
fond O
in O
public O
places O
) O
, O
but O
Master O
George B-PERSON
Gaunt I-PERSON
was O
called O
away O
by O


his O
mamma O
; O
and O
the O
stranger O
was O
treated O
with O
such O
cruelty O
finally O
, O
that O
even O


Lady O
Steyne B-PERSON
herself O
pitied O
her O
, O
and O
went O
up O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
friendless O


little O
woman O
. O


 O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
as O
her O
wan O
cheeks O
glowed O
with O
a O
blush O
, O


 O
says O
you O
sing O
and O
play O
very O
beautifully O
, O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
— O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
do O


me O
the O

 O


 O
I O
will O
do O
anything O
that O
may O
give O
pleasure O
to O
my O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
or O
to O
you O
, O
 O


said O
Rebecca B-PERSON
, O
sincerely O
grateful O
, O
and O
seating O
herself O
at O
the O
piano O
, O
began O
to O


sing O
. O


She O
sang O
religious O
songs O
of O
Mozart B-PERSON
, O
which O
had O
been O
early O
favourites O
of O
Lady O


Steyne B-PERSON
, O
and O
with O
such O
sweetness O
and O
tenderness O
that O
the O
lady O
, O
lingering O


round O
the O
piano O
, O
sate O
down O
by O
its O
side O
, O
and O
listened O
until O
the O
tears O
rolled O


down O
her O
eyes O
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
opposition O
ladies O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O


room O
kept O
up O
a O
loud O
and O
ceaseless O
buzzing O
and O
talkin O
but O
the O
Lady O
Steyne B-PERSON
did O


not O
hear O
those O
rumours O
. O
She O
was O
a O
child O
again O
— O
and O
had O
wandered O
back O
through O


a O
forty O
years O
’ O
wilderness O
to O
her O

The O

the O

the O

She O
was O
a O

once O

, O
and O
the O
brief O
period O
of O
her O
happiness O
bloomed O
out O
again O
for O
an B-TIME


hour I-TIME
— O
she O
started O
when O
the O
jarring O
doors O
were O
flung O
open O
, O
and O
with O
a O
loud O


laugh O
from O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O
the O
men O
of O
the O
party O
entered O
full O
of O
gaiety O

He O
saw O
at O
a O
glance O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
his O
absence O
: O
and O
was O
grateful O
to O


his O
wife O
for O
once O

He O
went O

spoke O
to O
her O

and O
called O
her O
by O
her O
Christian B-NORP


name O

so O
as O
again O
to O

blushes O
to O
her O
pale O
face—My O

says O
you O
have O


been O
singing O
like O

truth O

marshalling O
itself O

keeping O
its O

Poverty O

misery O
for O
all O

degradation O
for O
her O

injustice O

the O

one B-CARDINAL
by O
one B-CARDINAL
the O
outworks O

At O
the O
beginning O

him O
not O

withdraw O

painting O

their O
lonely O

not O
know O
the O


truth O

the O
matter O

The O
payment O
of O
Jos B-ORG

was O
still O
regular O
: O

it O


was O
a O
money O

lender O
in O
the O
City O

old O
Sedley B-PERSON

sold O

for O
a O
sum O

to O
prosecute O
his O
bootless O

Emmy B-PERSON
was O


calculating O
eagerly O
the O
time O
that O
would O
elapse O
before O
the O
letter O
would O


arrive O

She O

the B-DATE

not O
written O

him O

that O
that O

One B-DATE
day I-DATE

the O

more O

the O

secretly O
oppressed O

his O
private O

— O
the O
father O

happened O


to O
be O
left O
alone O
together O
; O
and O
Amelia B-PERSON
thought O
to O
comfort O
her O
father O

by O


telling O
him O
what O
she O

She O
had O
written O
to O
Joseph B-PERSON
— O
an O
answer O
must O
come O


in O
three B-DATE

He O
was O
always O
generous O

He O
could O


not O
refuse O
, O
when O
he O
knew O
how O
straitened O
were O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O


parents O

Then O
the O
poor O
old O
gentleman O
revealed O
the O
whole O
truth O
to O
her O
— O
that O
his O
son O


was O
still O
paying O
the O
annuity O
, O
which O
his O
own O
imprudence O
had O
flung O
away O

He O


had O
not O
dared O
to O
tell O
it O
sooner O

He O
thought O
Amelia B-PERSON

ghastly O
and O
terrified O


look O
, O
when O
, O
with O
a O
trembling O
, O
miserable O
voice O
he O
made O
the O
confession O
, O


conveyed O
reproaches O
to O
him O
for O
his O
concealment O
. O
 O
Ah O
! O
 O
said O
he O
, O
with O


quivering O
lips O
and O
turning O
away O
, O
 O
you O
despise O
your O
old O
father O
now O

 O


 O
O O

it O
is O
not O

, O
 O
Amelia B-PERSON
cried O
out O

falling O
on O
his O
neck O

and O


kissing O
him O
many O
times O

 O
You O
are O
always O
good O

You O
did O
it O
for O

 O
and O
she O
kissed O
him O
again O
wildly O
, O


and O
went O
away O

Still O
the O
father O
did O
not O
know O
what O
that O
explanation O
meant O
, O
and O
the O
burst O
of O


anguish O
with O
which O
the O
poor O
girl O
left O
him O
. O
It O
was O
that O
she O
was O
conquered O

The O
sentence O

The O

went O
out O

up O

And O


how O

the O

Samuel B-PERSON

she O

his O

how O

This O


little O
sermon O
she O
spoke O
with O
a O
gentle O
solemn O
voice O
, O
and O
dry O
eyes O
, O
until O
she O


came O
to O
the O
account O
of O
their O

then O
the O
discourse O
broke O
off O
suddenly O

the O

heart O
overflowed O

taking O
the O

she O
rocked O


him O
in O

wept O
silently O
over O
him O
in O
a O

agony O
of O
tears O

Her O
mind O

the O

— O
her O

her O
early O

the O
superscription)—one O
day O
Miss O
Osborne B-PERSON
got O
a O
letter O
from O
Amelia B-PERSON
which O
made O


her O
blush O
very O
much O
and O
look O
towards O
her O
father O
, O
sitting O
glooming O
in O
his O


place O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
table O
. O


In O
simple O
terms O
, O
Amelia B-PERSON
told O
her O
reasons O
which O
had O
induced O
her O
to O
change O


her O
mind O
respecting O
her O
boy O
. O
Her O
father O
had O
met O
with O
fresh O
misfortunes O
which O


had O
entirely O
ruined O
him O
. O
Her O
own O
pittance O
was O
so O
small O
that O
it O
would O
barely O


enable O
her O
to O
support O
her O
parents O
, O
and O
would O
not O
suffice O
to O
give O
George B-PERSON
the O


advantages O
which O
were O
his O
due O
. O
Great O
as O
her O
sufferings O
would O
be O
at O
parting O


with O
him O
she O
would O
, O
by O
God O
’s O
help O
, O
endure O
them O
for O
the O
boy O
’s O
sake O
. O
She O
knew O


that O
those O
to O
whom O
he O
was O
going O
would O
do O
all O
in O
their O
power O
to O
make O
him O


happy O
. O
She O
described O
his O
disposition O
, O
such O
as O
she O
fancied O
it O
; O
quick O
and O


impatient O
of O
control O
or O
harshness O
; O
easily O
to O
be O
moved O
by O
love O
and O
kindness O
. O


In O
a O
postscript O
, O
she O
stipulated O
that O
she O
should O
have O
a O
written O
agreement O
, O


that O
she O
should O
see O
the O
child O
as O
often O
as O
she O
wished,—she O
could O
not O
part O


with O
him O

The O

looked O

him O
very O

He O
was O
rather O


elated O
than O
otherwise O

and O
the O
poor O

turned O
sadly O
away O
. O
He O
bragged O


about O
the O
news O
that O
day O
to O
the O
boys O
at O
school O
; O
told O
them O
how O
he O
was O
going O

live O
with O
his O

, O
his O
father O

father O

not O
the O

who O

and O
that O
he O
would O
be O

a O

a O

, O


and O
go O

The O

was O

Indeed O
I O
have O

At O

the O

up O

the O
little O
humble O
packets O


containing O
tokens O
of O
love O

remembrance O
were O
ready O

disposed O
in O
the O


hall O
long O
since O
— O
George B-PERSON
was O
in O
his O
new O
suit O
, O
for O
which O
the O
tailor O
had O
come O


previously O
to O
measure O
him O
. O
He O
had O
sprung O
up O
with O
the O
sun O
and O
put O
on O
the O
new O


clothes O
; O
his O
mother O
hearing O
him O
from O
the O
room O
close O
by O
, O
in O
which O
she O
had O


been O
lying O
, O
in O
speechless O
grief O
and O
watching O

Days O
before O
she O
had O
been O


making O
preparations O
for O
the O
end O
; O
purchasing O
little O
stores O
for O
the O
boy O

use O
; O


marking O
his O
books O
and O
linen O
; O
talking O
with O
him O
and O
preparing O
him O
for O
the O


change O
— O
fondly O
fancying O
that O
he O
needed O
preparation O
. O


So O
that O
he O
had O
change O
, O
what O
cared O
he O
? O
He O
was O
longing O
for O
it O
. O
By O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL


eager O
declarations O
as O
to O
what O
he O
would O
do O
, O
when O
he O
went O
to O
live O
with O
his O


grandfather O
, O
he O
had O
shown O
the O
poor O
widow O
how O
little O
the O
idea O
of O
parting O
had O


cast O
him O
down O
. O
 O
He O
would O
come O
and O
see O
his O
mamma O
often O
on O
the O
pony O
, O
 O
he O
said O
: O


 O
he O
would O
come O
and O
fetch O
her O
in O
the O
carriage O
; O
they O
would O
drive O
in O
the O
Park O
, O


and O
she O
should O
have O
everything O
she O
wanted O
. O
 O
The O
poor O
mother O
was O
fain O
to O


content O
herself O
with O
these O
selfish O
demonstrations O
of O
attachment O
, O
and O
tried O


to O
convince O
herself O
how O
sincerely O
her O
son O
loved O
her O
. O
He O
must O
love O
her O
. O
All O


children O
were O
so O
: O
a O
little O
anxious O
for O
novelty O
, O
and O
— O
no O
, O
not O
selfish O
, O
but O


self O
- O
willed O
. O
Her O
child O
must O
have O
his O
enjoyments O
and O
ambition O
in O
the O
world O
. O


She O
herself O
, O
by O
her O
own O
selfishness O
and O
imprudent O
love O
for O
him O
, O
had O
denied O


him O
his O
just O
rights O
and O
pleasures O
hitherto O
. O


I O
know O
few O
things O
more O
affecting O
than O
that O
timorous O
debasement O
and O


self O
- O
humiliation O
of O
a O
woman O
. O
How O
she O
owns O
that O
it O
is O
she O
and O
not O
the O
man O
who O


is O
guilty O
: O
how O
she O
takes O
all O
the O
faults O
on O
her O
side O
: O
how O
she O
courts O
in O
a O


manner O
punishment O
for O
the O
wrongs O
which O
she O
has O
not O
committed O
, O
and O
persists O


in O
shielding O
the O
real O
culprit O
! O
It O
is O
those O
who O
injure O
women O
who O
get O
the O
most O


kindness O
from O
them O
— O
they O
are O
born O
timid O
and O
tyrants O
, O
and O
maltreat O
those O
who O


are O
humblest O
before O
them O

So O
poor O
Amelia B-PERSON
had O
been O
getting O
ready O
in O
silent O
misery O
for O
her O
son O

George B-PERSON

Tears O

of O

the O

took O

The O

I O

I O
swell O
with O
pride O
as O
these O
august B-DATE

transcribed O

and O
I O
think O
in O
what O
brilliant O
company O
my O
dear O
Becky B-PERSON
is O
moving O
. O
She O
became O
a O


constant O
guest O
at O
the B-ORG
French I-ORG
Embassy I-ORG

where O
no O

considered O
to O

Messieurs O

both O


attachés O
of O

were O
straightway O
smitten O
by O
the O
charms O
of O
the O

Colonel O

and O
both O
declared O
, O
according O
to O
the O

( O
for O

ever O
yet O
met O

that O

both O
, O
I O
say O
, O
declared O
that O
they O
were O

au B-GPE
mieux I-GPE

with O


the O
charming O
Madame O
Ravdonn O
. O


But O
I O
doubt O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
assertion O
. O
Champignac B-PERSON
was O
very O
fond O
of O


écarté O
, O
and O
made O
many O

parties O

with O
the O
Colonel O

evenings O
, O
while O


Becky B-PERSON
was O
singing O
to O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
in O
the O

; O
and O
as O
for O
Truffigny B-ORG
, O
it O


is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
fact O
that O
he O
dared O
not O
go O
to O
the O
Travellers O
’ O
, O
where O
he O
owed O


money O
to O
the O
waiters O
, O
and O
if O
he O
had O
not O
had O
the O
Embassy B-ORG
as O
a O
dining O

place O
, O


the O
worthy O
young O
gentleman O
must O
have O
starved O
. O
I O
doubt O
, O
I O
say O
, O
that O
Becky B-PERSON


would O
have O
selected O
either O
of O
these O
young O
men O
as O
a O
person O
on O
whom O
she O
would O


bestow O
her O
special O
regard O
. O
They O
ran O
of O
her O

purchased O
her O
gloves O


and O
flowers O
, O
went O
in O
debt O
for O
opera O

boxes O
for O
her O
, O
and O
made O
themselves O


amiable O
in O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
ways O
. O
And O
they O
talked O
English B-LANGUAGE
with O
adorable O


simplicity O
, O
and O
to O
the O
constant O
amusement O
of O
Becky B-PERSON
and O
my O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O
she O


would O
mimic O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
other O
to O
his O
face O
, O
and O
compliment O
him O
on O
his O
advance O
in O


the O
English B-LANGUAGE
language O
with O
a O
gravity O
which O
never O
failed O
to O
tickle O
the O


Marquis B-PERSON
, O
her O
sardonic O
old O
patron O
. O
Truffigny B-PERSON
gave O
Briggs B-ORG
a O
shawl O
by O
way O
of O


winning O
over O
Becky B-PERSON

confidante O
, O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
a O

which O
the O
simple O
spinster O
handed O
over O
in O
public O

the O

it O

and O
the O
composition O
of O

amused O
everybody O

greatly O

Lord O

read O
it O

Becky B-PERSON

to O

If O

I O
have O
your O

you O

I O

 O
Indeed O
, O
nobody O
wanted O
poor O
old O
Rawdon B-PERSON
at O
the O
parties O
whither O
Becky B-PERSON


used O
to O
go O
. O
She O
was O
often O
asked O
without O
him O
now O
. O
She O
talked O
about O
great O


people O
as O
if O
she O
had O
the O
fee O
- O
simple O
of O
May B-DATE
Fair I-DATE
; O
and O
when O
the O
Court B-ORG
went O


into O
mourning O
, O
she O
always O
wore O
black O
. O


Little O
Rawdon B-PERSON
being O
disposed O
of O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O
who O
took O
such O
a O
parental O


interest O
in O
the O
affairs O
of O
this O
amiable O
poor O
family O
, O
thought O
that O
their O


expenses O
might O
be O
very O
advantageously O
curtailed O
by O
the O
departure O
of O
Miss O


Briggs B-PERSON
; O
and O
that O
Becky B-PERSON
was O
quite O
clever O
enough O
to O
take O
the O
management O
of O
her O


own O
house O
. O
It O
has O
been O
narrated O
in O
a O
former O
chapter O
, O
how O
the O
benevolent O


nobleman O
had O
given O
his O

protégé O

money O
to O
pay O
off O
her O
little O
debt O
to O


Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
who O
however O
still O
remained O
behind O
with O
her O
friends O
; O
whence O
my O


lord O
came O
to O
the O
painful O
conclusion O
that O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
made O
some O
other O


use O
of O
the O
money O
confided O
to O
her O
than O
that O
for O
which O
her O
generous O
patron O
had O


given O
the O
loan O
. O
However O
, O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
was O
not O
so O
rude O
as O
to O
impart O
his O


suspicions O
upon O
this O
head O
to O
Mrs. O
Becky B-PERSON
, O
whose O
feelings O
might O
be O
hurt O
by O
any O


controversy O
on O
the O
money O
question O
, O
and O
who O
might O
have O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
painful O


reasons O
for O
disposing O
otherwise O
of O
his O
lordship O
’s O
generous O
loan O
. O
But O
he O


determined O
to O
satisfy O
himself O
of O
the O
real O
state O
of O
the O
case O
: O
and O
instituted O


the O
necessary O
inquiries O
in O
a O
most O
cautious O
and O
delicate O
manner O
. O


In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
he O
took O
an O
early O
opportunity O
of O
pumping O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
. O


That O
was O
not O
a O
difficult O
operation O
. O
A O
very O
little O
encouragement O
would O
set O


that O
worthy O
woman O
to O
talk O
volubly O
, O
and O
pour O
out O
all O
within O
her O
. O
And O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE


when O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
gone O
out O
to O
drive O
( O
as O
Mr. O
Fiche B-PERSON
, O
his O
lordship O
’s O


confidential O
servant O
, O
easily O
learned O
at O
the O
livery O
stables O
where O
the O


Crawleys B-ORG
kept O
their O
carriage O
and O
horses O
, O
or O
rather O
, O
where O
the O
livery O
- O
man O


kept O
a O
carriage O
and O
horses O
for O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Crawley)—my B-PERSON
lord I-PERSON
dropped O
in O
upon O


the O
Curzon O
Street O
house O
— O
asked O
Briggs B-PERSON
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee O
— O
told O
her O
that O
he O


had O
good O
accounts O
of O
the O
little O
boy O
at O
school O
— O
and O
in O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
found O
out O


from O
her O
that O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
nothing O
except O
a O
black O
silk O
gown O
, O


for O
which O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
was O
immensely O
grateful O
. O


He O
laughed O
within O
himself O
at O
this O
artless O
story O
. O
For O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
our O
dear O


friend O
Rebecca B-PERSON
had O
given O
him O
a O
most O
circumstantial O
narration O
of O
Briggs B-PERSON
’s O


delight O
at O
receiving O
her O
money O
— O
eleven B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
pounds I-CARDINAL
— O
and O
in O


what O
securities O
she O
had O
invested O
it O
; O
and O
what O
a O
pang O
Becky B-PERSON
herself O
felt O
in O


being O
obliged O
to O
pay O
away O
such O
a O
delightful O
sum O
of O
money O
. O
 O
Who O
knows O
, O
 O
the O


dear O
woman O
may O
have O
thought O
within O
herself O
, O
 O
perhaps O
he O
may O
give O
me O
a O
little O


more O
? O
 O
My O
lord O
, O
however O
, O
made O
no O
such O
proposal O
to O
the O
little O
schemer O
— O
very O


likely O
thinking O
that O
he O
had O
been O
sufficiently O
generous O
already O
. O


He O
had O
the O
curiosity O
, O
then O
, O
to O
ask O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
about O
the O
state O
of O
her O


private O
affairs O
— O
and O
she O
told O
his O
lordship O
candidly O
what O
her O
position O
was O
— O
how O


Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
left O
her O
a O
legacy O
— O
how O
her O
relatives O
had O
had O
part O
of O
it O
— O
how O


Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
had O
put O
out O
another O
portion O
, O
for O
which O
she O
had O
the O
best O


security O
and O
interest O
— O
and O
how O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
had O
kindly O
busied O


themselves O
with O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
to O
dispose O
of O
the O
remainder O
most O


advantageously O
for O
her O
, O
when O
he O
had O
time O
. O
My O
lord O
asked O
how O
much O
the O
Colonel O


had O
already O
invested O
for O
her O
, O
and O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
at O
once O
and O
truly O
told O
him O


that O
the O
sum O
was O
six B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
odd I-CARDINAL
pounds I-CARDINAL
. O


But O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
told O
her O
story O
, O
the O
voluble O
Briggs B-PERSON
repented O
of O
her O


frankness O
, O
and O
besought O
my O
lord O
not O
to O
tell O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
of O
the O
confessions O


which O
she O
had O
made O
. O
 O
The O
Colonel O
was O
so O
kind O
— O
Mr. O
Crawley B-PERSON
might O
be O
offended O


and O
pay O
back O
the O
money O
, O
for O
which O
she O
could O
get O
no O
such O
good O
interest O


anywhere O
else O
. O
 O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O
laughing O
, O
promised O
he O
never O
would O
divulge O
their O


conversation O
, O
and O
when O
he O
and O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
parted O
he O
laughed O
still O
more O
. O


 O
What O
an O
accomplished O
little O
devil O
it O
is O
! O
 O
thought O
he O
. O
 O
What O
a O
splendid O


actress O
and O
manager O
! O
She O
had O
almost O
got O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
supply O
out O
of O
me O
the O
other O


day O
, O
with O
her O
coaxing O
ways O
. O
She O
beats O
all O
the O
women O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
the O


course O
of O
all O
my O
well O
- O
spent O
life O
. O
They O
are O
babies O
compared O
to O
her O
. O
I O
am O
a O


greenhorn O
myself O
, O
and O
a O
fool O
in O
her O
hands O
— O
an O
old O
fool O
. O
She O
is O
unsurpassable O


in O
lies O
. O
 O
His O
lordship O
’s O
admiration O
for O
Becky B-PERSON
rose O
immeasurably O
at O
this O


proof O
of O
her O
cleverness O
. O
Getting O
the O
money O
was O
nothing O
— O
but O
getting O
double O


the O
sum O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
paying O
nobody O
— O
it O
was O
a O
magnificent O
stroke O
. O
And O


Crawley B-PERSON
, O
my O
lord O
thought O
— O
Crawley B-GPE
is O
not O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
he O
looks O
and O
seems O
. O


He O
has O
managed O
the O
matter O
cleverly O
enough O
on O
his O
side O
. O
Nobody O
would O
ever O


have O
supposed O
from O
his O
face O
and O
demeanour O
that O
he O
knew O
anything O
about O
this O


money O
business O
; O
and O
yet O
he O
put O
her O
up O
to O
it O
, O
and O
has O
spent O
the O
money O
, O
no O


doubt O
. O
In O
this O
opinion O
my O
lord O
, O
we O
know O
, O
was O
mistaken O
; O
but O
it O
influenced O
a O


good O
deal O
his O
behaviour O
towards O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
whom O
he O
began O
to O
treat O
with O


even O
less O
than O
the O
semblance O
of O
respect O
which O
he O
had O
formerly O
shown O
towards O


that O
gentleman O
. O
It O
never O
entered O
into O
the O
head O
of O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
patron O
that O


the O
little O
lady O
might O
be O
making O
a O
purse O
for O
herself O
; O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
if O
the O


truth O
must O
be O
told O
, O
he O
judged O
of O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
by O
his O
experience O
of O
other O


husbands O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
known O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
long O
and O
well O
- O
spent O
life O


which O
had O
made O
him O
acquainted O
with O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
the O
weakness O
of O
mankind O
. O


My O
lord O
had O
bought O
so O
many O
men O
during O
his O
life O
, O
that O
he O
was O
surely O
to O
be O


pardoned O
for O
supposing O
that O
he O
had O
found O
the O
price O
of O
this O
one O
. O


He O
taxed O
Becky B-PERSON
upon O
the O
point O
on O
the O
very O
first B-ORDINAL
occasion O
when O
he O
met O
her O


alone O
, O
and O
he O
complimented O
her O
, O
good O
- O
humouredly O
, O
on O
her O
cleverness O
in O


getting O
more O
than O
the O
money O
which O
she O
required O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
was O
only O
a O
little O


taken O
aback O
. O
It O
was O
not O
the O
habit O
of O
this O
dear O
creature O
to O
tell O
falsehoods O
, O


except O
when O
necessity O
compelled O
, O
but O
in O
these O
great O
emergencies O
it O
was O
her O


practise O
to O
lie O
very O
freely O
; O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
she O
was O
ready O
with O
another O


neat O
plausible O
circumstantial O
story O
which O
she O
administered O
to O
her O
patron O
. O


The O
previous O
statement O
which O
she O
had O
made O
to O
him O
was O
a O
falsehood O
— O
a O
wicked O


falsehood O
; O
she O
owned O
it O
; O
but O
who O
had O
made O
her O
tell O
it O
? O
 O
Ah O
, O
my O
Lord O
, O
 O
she O


said O
, O
 O
you O
do O
n’t O
know O
all O
I O
have O
to O
suffer O
and O
bear O
in O
silence O
: O
you O
see O
me O


gay O
and O
happy O
before O
you O
— O
you O
little O
know O
what O
I O
have O
to O
endure O
when O
there O
is O


no O
protector O
near O
me O
. O
It O
was O
my O
husband O
, O
by O
threats O
and O
the O
most O
savage O


treatment O
, O
forced O
me O
to O
ask O
for O
that O
sum O
about O
which O
I O
deceived O
you O
. O
It O
was O


he O
, O
who O
, O
foreseeing O
that O
questions O
might O
be O
asked O
regarding O
the O
disposal O
of O


the O
money O
, O
forced O
me O
to O
account O
for O
it O
as O
I O
did O
. O
He O
took O
the O
money O
. O
He O
told O


me O
he O
had O
paid O
Miss O
Briggs B-PERSON
; O
I O
did O
not O
want O
, O
I O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
doubt O
him O
. O


Pardon O
the O
wrong O
which O
a O
desperate O
man O
is O
forced O
to O
commit O
, O
and O
pity O
a O


miserable O
, O
miserable O
woman O
. O
 O
She O
burst O
into O
tears O
as O
she O
spoke O
. O
Persecuted O


virtue O
never O
looked O
more O
bewitchingly O
wretched O
. O


They O
had O
a O
long O
conversation O
, O
driving O
round O
and O
round O
the B-LOC
Regent I-LOC
’s I-LOC
Park I-LOC
in O


Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
carriage O
together O
, O
a O
conversation O
of O
which O
it O
is O
not O


necessary O
to O
repeat O
the O
details O
: O
but O
the O
upshot O
of O
it O
was O
, O
that O
, O
when O
Becky B-PERSON


came O
home O
, O
she O
flew O
to O
her O
dear O
Briggs B-PERSON
with O
a O
smiling O
face O
, O
and O
announced O


that O
she O
had O
some O
very O
good O
news O
for O
her O
. O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
had O
acted O
in O
the O


noblest O
and O
most O
generous O
manner O
He O
was O
always O
thinking O
how O
and O
when O
he O


could O
do O
good O
. O
Now O
that O
little O
Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
gone O
to O
school O
, O
a O
dear O
companion O


and O
friend O
was O
no O
longer O
necessary O
to O
her O
. O
She O
was O
grieved O
beyond O
measure O
to O


part O
with O
Briggs B-ORG
; O
but O
her O
means O
required O
that O
she O
should O
practise O
every O


retrenchment O
, O
and O
her O
sorrow O
was O
mitigated O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
her O
dear O
Briggs B-PERSON


would O
be O
far O
better O
provided O
for O
by O
her O
generous O
patron O
than O
in O
her O
humble O


home O
. O
Mrs. O
Pilkington B-PERSON
, O
the O
housekeeper O
at O
Gauntly B-FAC
Hall I-FAC
, O
was O
growing O


exceedingly O
old O
, O
feeble O
, O
and O
rheumatic O
: O
she O
was O
not O
equal O
to O
the O
work O
of O


superintending O
that O
vast O
mansion O
, O
and O
must O
be O
on O
the O
look O
- O
out O
for O
a O


successor O
. O
It O
was O
a O
splendid O
position O
. O
The O
family O
did O
not O
go O
to O
Gauntly B-PERSON
once O


in O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
At O
other O
times O
the O
housekeeper O
was O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O


magnificent O
mansion O
— O
had O
four B-CARDINAL
covers O
daily B-DATE
for O
her O
table O
; O
was O
visited O
by O
the O


clergy O
and O
the O
most O
respectable O
people O
of O
the O
county O
— O
was O
the O
lady O
of O


Gauntly B-PERSON
, O
in O
fact O
; O
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
last O
housekeepers O
before O
Mrs. O
Pilkington B-PERSON
had O


married O
rectors O
of O
Gauntly B-PERSON
: O
but O
Mrs. O
P. B-PERSON
could O
not O
, O
being O
the O
aunt O
of O
the O


present O
Rector O
. O
The O
place O
was O
not O
to O
be O
hers O
yet O
; O
but O
she O
might O
go O
down O
on O
a O


visit O
to O
Mrs. O
Pilkington B-PERSON
, O
and O
see O
whether O
she O
would O
like O
to O
succeed O
her O
. O


What O
words O
can O
paint O
the O
ecstatic O
gratitude O
of O
Briggs B-PERSON
! O
All O
she O
stipulated O


for O
was O
that O
little O
Rawdon B-PERSON
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
come O
down O
and O
see O
her O
at O
the O


Hall B-PERSON
. O
Becky B-PERSON
promised O
this O
— O
anything O
. O
She O
ran O
up O
to O
her O
husband O
when O
he O
came O


home O
, O
and O
told O
him O
the O
joyful O
news O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
glad O
, O
deuced O
glad O
; O
the O
weight O


was O
off O
his O
conscience O
about O
poor O
Briggs B-PERSON
’s O
money O
. O
She O
was O
provided O
for O
, O
at O


any O
rate O
, O
but O
— O
but O
his O
mind O
was O
disquiet O
. O
He O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
all O
right O


somehow O
. O
He O
told O
little O
Southdown B-LOC
what O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
had O
done O
, O
and O
the O
young O


man O
eyed O
Crawley B-GPE
with O
an O
air O
which O
surprised O
the O
latter O
. O


He O
told O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
of O
this O
second B-ORDINAL
proof O
of O
Steyne B-ORG
’s O
bounty O
, O
and O
she O
, O
too O
, O


looked O
odd O
and O
alarmed O
; O
so O
did O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
. O
 O
She O
is O
too O
clever O
and O
— O
and O
gay O
to O


be O
allowed O
to O
go O
from O
party O
to O
party O
without O
a O
companion O

 O
both O
said O

 O
You O


must O
go O
with O
her O
, O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
wherever O
she O
goes O
, O
and O
you O

must O

have O


somebody O
with O
her O
— O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
girls O
from O
Queen B-PERSON
’s O
Crawley B-GPE
, O
perhaps O
, O
though O


they O
were O
rather O
giddy O
guardians O
for O
her O
. O
 O


Somebody O
Becky B-PERSON
should O
have O
. O
But O
in O
the O
meantime O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
honest O


Briggs B-PERSON
must O
not O
lose O
her O
chance O
of O
settlement O
for O
life O
; O
and O
so O
she O
and O
her O


bags O
were O
packed O
, O
and O
she O
set O
off O
on O
her O
journey O
. O
And O
so O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
Rawdon B-PERSON
’s O


out O
- O
sentinels O
were O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
enemy O
. O


Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
went O
and O
expostulated O
with O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
upon O
the O
subject O
of O


the O
dismissal O
of O
Briggs B-ORG
, O
and O
other O
matters O
of O
delicate O
family O
interest O
. O
In O


vain O
she O
pointed O
out O
to O
him O
how O
necessary O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON


for O
her O
poor O
husband O
; O
how O
cruel O
it O
would O
be O
on O
their O
part O
to O
deprive O
Briggs B-PERSON


of O
the O
position O
offered O
to O
her O
. O
Cajolements B-PERSON
, O
coaxings B-GPE
, O
smiles O
, O
tears O
could O


not O
satisfy O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
and O
he O
had O
something O
very O
like O
a O
quarrel O
with O
his O
once O


admired O
Becky B-PERSON
. O
He O
spoke O
of O
the O
honour O
of O
the O
family O
: O
the O
unsullied O


reputation O
of O
the O
Crawleys B-ORG
; O
expressed O
himself O
in O
indignant O
tones O
about O
her O


receiving O
those O
young O
Frenchmen B-NORP
— O
those O
wild O
young O
men O
of O
fashion O
, O
my O
Lord O


Steyne B-PERSON
himself O
, O
whose O
carriage O
was O
always O
at O
her O
door O
, O
who O
passed O
hours B-TIME


daily B-DATE
in O
her O
company O
, O
and O
whose O
constant O
presence O
made O
the O
world O
talk O
about O


her O
. O
As O
the O
head O
of O
the O
house O
he O
implored O
her O
to O
be O
more O
prudent O
. O
Society O


was O
already O
speaking O
lightly O
of O
her O
. O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O
though O
a O
nobleman O
of O
the O


greatest O
station O
and O
talents O
, O
was O
a O
man O
whose O
attentions O
would O
compromise O


any O
woman O
; O
he O
besought O
, O
he O
implored O
, O
he O
commanded O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
to O
be O


watchful O
in O
her O
intercourse O
with O
that O
nobleman O
. O


Becky B-PERSON
promised O
anything O
and O
everything O
Pitt B-PERSON
wanted O
; O
but O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
came O
to O


her O
house O
as O
often O
as O
ever O
, O
and O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
anger O
increased O
. O
I O
wonder O
was O


Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
angry O
or O
pleased O
that O
her O
husband O
at O
last O
found O
fault O
with O
his O


favourite O
Rebecca B-PERSON
? O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
visits O
continuing O
, O
his O
own O
ceased O
; O
and O
his O


wife O
was O
for O
refusing O
all O
further O
intercourse O
with O
that O
nobleman O
, O
and O


declining O
the O
invitation O
to O
the O
Charade O
- O
night O
which O
the O
Marchioness B-ORG
sent O
to O


her O
; O
but O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
thought O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
accept O
it O
, O
as O
his O
Royal O


Highness O
would O
be O
there O
. O


Although O
he O
went O
to O
the O
party O
in O
question O
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
quitted O
it O
very O
early O
, O


and O
his O
wife O
, O
too O
, O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
come O
away O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
hardly O
so O
much O
as O
spoke O


to O
him O
or O
noticed O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
declared O
her O
behaviour O
was O


monstrously O
indecorous O
, O
reprobated O
in O
strong O
terms O
the O
habit O
of O
play O
- O
acting O


and O
fancy O
dressing O
, O
as O
highly O
unbecoming O
a O
British B-NORP
female O
; O
and O
after O
the O


charades O
were O
over O
, O
took O
his O
brother O
Rawdon B-PERSON
severely O
to O
task O
for O
appearing O


himself O
, O
and O
allowing O
his O
wife O
to O
join O
in O
such O
improper O
exhibitions O
. O


Rawdon B-PERSON
said O
she O
should O
not O
join O
in O
any O
more O
such O
amusements O
: O
but O
indeed O
, O


and O
perhaps O
from O
hints O
from O
his O
elder O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
he O
had O
already O


become O
a O
very O
watchful O
and O
exemplary O
domestic O
character O
. O
He O
left O
off O
his O


clubs O
and O
billiards O
. O
He O
never O
left O
home O
. O
He O
took O
Becky B-PERSON
out O
to O
drive O
: O
he O
went O


laboriously O
with O
her O
to O
all O
her O
parties O
. O
Whenever O
my O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
called O
, O
he O


was O
sure O
to O
find O
the O
Colonel O

And O
when O
Becky B-PERSON
proposed O
to O
go O
out O
without O
her O


husband O
, O
or O
received O
invitations O
for O
herself O
, O
he O
peremptorily O
ordered O
her O
to O


refuse O
them O
; O
and O
there O
was O
that O
in O
the O
gentleman O

manner O
which O
enforced O


obedience O

Little O
Becky B-PERSON

If O

Whether O

she O

always O
a O

was O
attentive O

 O
How O

it O

 O

would O

you O

He O

all O


those O

 O


When O
Rawdon B-PERSON
read O
over O
this O
letter O
, O
he O
turned O
so O
red O
and O
looked O
so O
savage O
, O


that O
the O
company O
at O
the O
table O
d’hôte O
easily O
perceived O
that O
bad O
news O
had O


reached O
him O

All O

to O
think O

what O
he O
suspected O

Leaving O
the O
room O
hurriedly O
, O


he O
ran O
into O
his O

— O
opened O
his O
desk O
, O
wrote O
two B-CARDINAL
hurried O

In O

he O
entreated O

He O
went O
back O

the O
dining O

room O
after O
dispatching O
his O
messenger O
, O
and O
called O


for O
more O
wine O
. O
He O
laughed O
and O
talked O
with O
a O
strange O
boisterousness O
, O
as O
the O


people O
thought O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
laughed O
madly O
at O
his O
own O
fears O
, O
and O
went O
on O


drinking O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
; O
listening O
all O
the O
while O
for O
the O
carriage O
which O
was O
to O


bring O
his O
fate O
back O
. O


At O
the O
expiration O
of O
that O
time O
, O
wheels O
were O
heard O
whirling O
up O
to O
the O


gate O
— O
the O
young O
Janitor B-ORG
went O
out O
with O
his O
gate O

keys O
. O
It O
was O
a O
lady O
whom O
he O


let O
in O
at O
the O
bailiff O
’s O
door O
. O


 O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
trembling O
very O
much O
. O
He O
, O
with O
a O
knowing O
look O
, O


locked O
the O
outer O
door O
upon O
her O
— O
then O
unlocked O
and O
opened O
the O
inner O
one O
, O
and O


calling O
out O
, O
 O
Colonel O
, O
you O
’re O
wanted O
, O
 O
led O
her O
into O
the O
back O
parlour O
, O
which O


he O
occupied O
. O


Rawdon B-PERSON
came O
in O
from O
the O
dining O
- O
parlour O
where O
all O
those O
people O
were O


carousing O
, O
into O
his O
back O
room O
; O
a O
flare O
of O
coarse O
light O
following O
him O
into O


the O
apartment O
where O
the O
lady O
stood O
, O
still O
very O
nervous O
. O


 O
It O
is O
I O
, O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O
in O
a O
timid O
voice O
, O
which O
she O
strove O
to O
render O


cheerful O
. O
 O
It O
is O
Jane B-PERSON
. O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
was O
quite O
overcome O
by O
that O
kind O
voice O
and O


presence O
. O
He O
ran O
up O
to O
her O
— O
caught O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
— O
gasped O
out O
some O


inarticulate O
words O
of O
thanks O
, O
and O
fairly O
sobbed O
on O
her O
shoulder O
. O
She O
did O
not O


know O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
emotion O
. O


The O
bills O
of O
Mr. O
Moss B-PERSON
were O
quickly O
settled O
, O
perhaps O
to O
the O
disappointment O


of O
that O
gentleman O
, O
who O
had O
counted O
on O
having O
the O
Colonel O
as O
his O
guest O
over O


Sunday B-DATE

; O
and O
Jane B-PERSON
, O
with O

happiness O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O


carried O
away O
Rawdon B-PERSON
from O
the O
bailiff O

house O
, O
and O
they O
went O
homewards O
in O
the O


cab O
in O
which O
she O

Poor O

 O


 O
I O

But O
as O
for O

I O
might O
as O
well O
hope O
to O

the O

It O
is O


madness O
, O
sheer O
madness O
, O
to O
think O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
. O
You O
must O
come O
to O
a O


compromise O
. O
It O
’s O
a O

thing O
for O
the O

everybody O

it O

There O
was O
George B-PERSON

, O
Lord O
Ragland B-PERSON

went O
through O
the O
Court B-ORG
last B-DATE


week I-DATE
, O
and O
was O
what O
they O
call O
white O

washed O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
Lord O
Ragland B-PERSON
would O
not O


pay O
a O
shilling O
for O
him O
, O
and O
— O
— O
 O


 O
It O
’s O
not O
money O
I O
want O
, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
broke O
in O
. O
 O
I O
’m O
not O
come O
to O
you O
about O


myself O

Never O
mind O
what O
happens O
to O
me O
— O
— O
 O


 O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
, O
then O
? O
 O
said O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
somewhat O
relieved O
. O


 O
It O
’s O
the O
boy O
, O
 O
said O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
husky O
voice O
. O
 O
I O
want O
you O
to O
promise O
me O


that O
you O
will O
take O
charge O
of O
him O
when O
I O
’m O
gone O
. O
That O
dear O
good O
wife O
of O
yours O


has O
always O
been O
good O
to O
him O
; O
and O
he O
’s O
fonder O
of O
her O
than O
he O
is O
of O
his O
… O
— O
Damn O


it O
. O
Look O
here O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
— O
you O
know O
that O
I O
was O
to O
have O
had O
Miss O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O
money O
. O
I O


was O
n’t O
brought O
up O
like O
a O
younger O
brother O
: O
but O
was O
always O
encouraged O
to O
be O


extravagant O
and O
kep O
idle O
. O
But O
for O
this O
I O
might O
have O
been O
quite O
a O
different O


man O
. O
I O
did O
n’t O
do O
my O
duty O
with O
the O
regiment O
so O
bad O
. O
You O
know O
how O
I O
was O
thrown O


over O
about O
the O
money O
, O
and O
who O
got O
it O
. O
 O


 O
After O
the O
sacrifices O
I O
have O
made O
, O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
I O
have O
stood O
by O


you O
, O
I O
think O
this O
sort O
of O
reproach O
is O
useless O
, O
 O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
said O
. O
 O
Your O


marriage O
was O
your O
own O
doing O
, O
not O
mine O
. O
 O


 O
That O
’s O
over O
now O
, O
 O
said O
Rawdon.—That O
’s O
over O
now O
. O
 O
And O
the O
words O
were O


wrenched O
from O
him O
with O
a O
groan O
, O
which O
made O
his O
brother O
start O
. O


 O
Good O
God O
! O
is O
she O
dead O
? O
 O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O
voice O
of O
genuine O
alarm O
and O


commiseration O
. O


 O
I O
wish O

I O

was O
, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
replied O
. O
 O
If O
it O
was O
n’t O
for O
little O
Rawdon B-PERSON


I O
’d O
have O
cut O
my O
throat O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
— O
and O
that O
damned O
villain O
’s O
too O
. O
 O


Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
instantly O
guessed O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
surmised O
that O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
was O
the O


person O
whose O
life O
Rawdon B-PERSON
wished O
to O
take O
. O
The O
Colonel O
told O
his O
senior O


briefly O
, O
and O
in O
broken O
accents O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
case O
. O
 O
It O
was O
a O


regular O
plan O
between O
that O
scoundrel O
and O
her O
, O
 O
he O
said O
. O
 O
The O
bailiffs O
were O


put O
upon O
me O
: O
I O
was O
taken O
as O
I O
was O
going O
out O
of O
his O
house O
: O
when O
I O
wrote O
to O


her O
for O
money O
, O
she O
said O
she O
was O
ill O
in O
bed O
, O
and O
put O
me O
off O
to O
another O
day O
. O


And O
when O
I O
got O
home O
I O
found O
her O
in O
diamonds O
and O
sitting O
with O
that O
villain O


alone O
. O
 O


He O
then O
went O
on O
to O
describe O
hurriedly O
the O
personal O
conflict O
with O
Lord O


Steyne B-PERSON
. O
To O
an O
affair O
of O
that O
nature O
, O
of O
course O
, O
he O
said O
, O
there O
was O
but O
one B-CARDINAL


issue O
; O
and O
after O
his O
conference O
with O
his O
brother O
, O
he O
was O
going O
away O
to O
make O


the O
necessary O
arrangements O
for O
the O
meeting O
which O
must O
ensue O
. O
 O
And O
as O
it O
may O


end O
fatally O
with O
me O
, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
said O
with O
a O
broken O
voice O
, O
 O
and O
as O
the O
boy O
has O


no O
mother O
, O
I O
must O
leave O
him O
to O
you O
and O
Jane B-PERSON
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
— O
only O
it O
will O
be O
a O
comfort O


to O
me O
if O
you O
will O
promise O
me O
to O
be O
his O
friend O
. O
 O


The O
elder O
brother O
was O
much O
affected O
, O
and O
shook O
Rawdons B-ORG
hand O
with O
a O


cordiality O
seldom O
exhibited O
by O
him O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
passed O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
shaggy O


eyebrows O
. O
 O
Thank O
you O
, O
brother O
, O
 O
said O
he O
. O
 O
I O
know O
I O
can O
trust O
your O
word O
. O
 O


 O
I O
will O
, O
upon O
my O
honour O
, O
 O
the O
Baronet O
said O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
and O
almost O
mutely O
, O


this O
bargain O
was O
struck O
between O
them O
. O


Then O
Rawdon B-PERSON
took O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
the O
little O
pocketbook O
which O
he O
had O


discovered O
in O
Becky B-PERSON
’s O
desk O
: O
and O
from O
which O
he O
drew O
a O
bundle O
of O
notes O
which O


it O
contained O
. O
 O
Here O
’s O
six B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
, O
 O
he O
said—you O
did O
n’t O
know O
I O
was O
so O
rich O
. O


I O
want O
you O
to O
give O
the O
money O
to O
Briggs B-PERSON
, O
who O
lent O
it O
to O
us O
— O
and O
who O
was O
kind O


to O
the O
boy O
— O
and O
I O
’ve O
always O
felt O
ashamed O
of O
having O
taken O
the O
poor O
old O
woman O
’s O


money O
. O
And O
here O
’s O
some O
more O
— O
I’ve O
only O
kept O
back O
a B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
— O
which O
Becky B-PERSON
may O


as O
well O
have O
, O
to O
get O
on O
with O
. O
 O
As O
he O
spoke O
he O
took O
hold O
of O
the O
other O
notes O


to O
give O
to O
his O
brother O
, O
but O
his O
hands O
shook O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
agitated O
that O
the O


pocket O
- O
book O
fell O
from O
him O
, O
and O
out O
of O
it O
the O
thousand B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
pound I-QUANTITY
note O
which O
had O


been O
the O
last O
of O
the O
unlucky O
Becky B-PERSON
’s O
winnings O
. O


Pitt B-PERSON
stooped O
and O
picked O
them O
up O
, O
amazed O
at O
so O
much O
wealth O
. O
 O
Not O
that O
, O
 O


Rawdon B-PERSON
said—I I-PERSON
hoped O
to O
put O
a O
bullet O
into O
the O
man O
whom O
that O
belongs O
to O
. O
 O
He O


had O
thought O
to O
himself O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
fine O
revenge O
to O
wrap O
a O
ball O
in O
the O


note O
, O
and O
kill O
Steyne B-ORG
with O
it O
. O


After O
this O
colloquy O
the O
brothers O
once O
more O
shook O
hands O
and O
parted O
. O
Lady O


Jane B-PERSON
had O
heard O
of O
the O
Colonel O
’s O
arrival O
and O
was O
waiting O
for O
her O
husband O
in O


the O
adjoining O
dining O
- O
room O
, O
with O
female O
instinct O
, O
auguring O
evil O
. O
The O
door O
of O


the O
dining O
- O
room O
happened O
to O
be O
left O
open O
, O
and O
the O
lady O
of O
course O
was O
issuing O


from O
it O
as O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
brothers O
passed O
out O
of O
the O
study O
. O
She O
held O
out O
her O
hand O


to O
Rawdon B-GPE
, O
and O
said O
she O
was O
glad O
he O
was O
come O
to O
breakfast O
; O
though O
she O
could O


perceive O
, O
by O
his O
haggard O
unshorn O
face O
, O
and O
the O
dark O
looks O
of O
her O
husband O
, O


that O
there O
was O
very O
little O
question O
of O
breakfast O
between O
them O
. O
Rawdon B-PERSON


muttered O
some O
excuses O
about O
an O
engagement O
, O
squeezing O
hard O
the O
timid O
little O


hand O
which O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
reached O
out O
to O
him O
. O
Her O
imploring O
eyes O
could O


read O
nothing O
but O
calamity O
in O
his O
face O
; O
but O
he O
went O
away O
without O
another O


word O
. O
Nor O
did O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
vouchsafe O
her O
any O
explanation O
. O
The O
children O
came O
up O


to O
salute O
him O
, O
and O
he O
kissed O
them O
in O
his O
usual O
frigid O
manner O
. O
The O
mother O


took O
both O
of O
them O
close O
to O
herself O
, O
and O
held O
a O
hand O
of O
each O
of O
them O
as O
they O


knelt O
down O
to O
prayers O
, O
which O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
read O
to O
them O
, O
and O
to O
the O
servants O
in O


their O
Sunday B-DATE
suits O
or O
liveries O
, O
ranged O
upon O

on O
the O
other O

of O
the O


hissing O

. O
Breakfast O
was O
so O
late O
that O
day O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
the O


delays O
which O
had O
occurred O
, O
that O
the O
church O

bells O
began O
to O
ring O
whilst O
they O


were O
sitting O
over O
their O
meal O
: O
and O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
was O
too O
ill O
, O
she O
said O
, O
to O
go O


church O
, O
though O
her O
thoughts O
had O
been O
entirely O
astray O
during O
the O
period O
of O

Rawdon B-PERSON

 O
What O

 O
No O

 O


 O
It O

about O
my O

The O

 O
I O

 O
he O


began:—indeed O
there O

Colonel O

so O
lightly O
was O
his O

esteemed O
by O

the O

; O
but O
seeing O
the O

look O
with O


which O
Rawdon B-PERSON
answered O
the O

, O
Macmurdo B-GPE
did O
not O

 O
Is O
there O
no O

 O
the O

 O
Is O
it O

. O
 O
 O
Think O
of O
his O
only O
finding O
her O
out O
now O
, O
 O
the O
Captain O
thought O


to O
himself O
, O
and O
remembered O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
particular O

at O

Mrs. O

 O
There O

no O

one B-CARDINAL
out O

it O
, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
replied—and O
there O

only O
a O

out O

it O
for O

of O

, O
Mac B-PERSON

 O


 O
Serve O

 O
Macmurdo B-ORG

 O
Who O

 O
It O

Mac B-PERSON
, O
 O
said O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
quite O
overcome O
; O
and O
, O
covering O


his O
face O
with O
his O
hands O
, O
he O
gave O
way O
to O
an O
emotion O
, O
the O
sight O
of O

caused O
the O

opposite O

 O
You O

I O

Rawdon B-PERSON

, O
half B-CARDINAL


inarticulately O
. O
 O
Damme B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
I O
followed O
her O
like O

 O
He O
then O
fiercely O

incoherently O
, O
and O
with O
an O


agitation O
under O
which O
his O

had O
never O

 O


 O
It O
may O

, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
answered O
sadly O
; O
 O
but O
this O
do O

 O


and O
he O
showed O
the O

 O
The O
Captain O
could O
not O
but O

had O
a O
very O
ugly O

. O


Whilst O

Rawdon B-PERSON

Rawdon B-PERSON

the O

Captain O

In O
a O
postscript O
the O
Captain O
stated O
that O
he O
had O
in O
his O
possession O
a O


bank O
- O
note O
for O
a O
large O

, O
which O
Colonel O

reason O
to O

And O

no O

He O
would O
be O
sold O


up O
and O
turned O
out O

his O
shop O

his O
house O
, O
because O
he O
had O
trusted O
to O
the O


Crawley B-PERSON
family O
. O
His O
tears O
and O
lamentations O
made O
Becky B-PERSON
more O
peevish O
than O

 O
You O

I O
declare O

This O
audacious O
statement O
caused O
Raggles O
and O
the O
other O
personages O
present O
to O


look O
at O
one O
another O
with O
a O
wild O
surprise O
, O
and O
with O
it O
Rebecca B-PERSON
left O
them O
. O
She O


went O
upstairs O
and O
dressed O
herself O
this O
time O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
her O
French B-NORP


maid O
. O
She O
went O
into O
Rawdon B-GPE
’s O
room O
, O
and O
there O
saw O
that O
a O
trunk O
and O
bag O
were O


packed O
ready O
for O
removal O
, O
with O
a O
pencil O
direction O
that O
they O
should O
be O
given O


when O
called O
for O
; O
then O
she O
went O
into O
the O
Frenchwoman B-NORP
’s O
garret O
; O
everything O
was O


clean O
, O
and O
all O
the O
drawers O
emptied O
there O
. O
She O
bethought O
herself O
of O
the O


trinkets O
which O
had O
been O
left O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
felt O
certain O
that O
the O
woman O


had O
fled O
. O
 O
Good O
Heavens O
! O
was O
ever O
such O
ill O
luck O
as O
mine O
? O
 O
she O
said O
; O
 O
to O
be O


so O
near O
, O
and O
to O
lose O
all O
. O
Is O
it O
all O
too O
late O
? O
 O
No O
; O
there O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
chance O


more O
. O


She O
dressed O
herself O
, O
and O
went O
away O
unmolested O
this O
time O
, O
but O
alone O
. O
It O
was O


four B-TIME
o’clock I-TIME
. O
She O
went O
swiftly O
down O
the O
streets O
( O
she O
had O
no O
money O
to O
pay O
for O


a O
carriage O
) O
, O
and O
never O
stopped O
until O
she O
came O
to O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
’s O
door O
, O
in O


Great B-FAC
Gaunt I-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O
Where O
was O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
? O
She O
was O
at O
church O
. O
Becky B-PERSON


was O
not O
sorry O
. O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
was O
in O
his O
study O
, O
and O
had O
given O
orders O
not O
to O
be O


disturbed O
— O
she O
must O
see O
him O
— O
she O
slipped O
by O
the O
sentinel O
in O
livery O
at O
once O
, O


and O
was O
in O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
room O
before O
the O
astonished O
Baronet O
had O
even O
laid O
down O


the O
paper O
. O


He O
turned O
red O
and O
started O
back O
from O
her O
with O
a O
look O
of O
great O
alarm O
and O


horror O
. O


 O
Do O
not O
look O
so O
, O
 O
she O
said O
. O
 O
I O
am O
not O
guilty O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
dear O
Pitt B-PERSON
; O
you O
were O
my O


friend O
once O
. O
Before O
God O
, O
I O
am O
not O
guilty O
. O
I O
seem O
so O
. O
Everything O
is O
against O


me O
. O
And O
O O
! O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
! O
just O
when O
all O
my O
hopes O
were O
about O
to O
be O


realized O
: O
just O
when O
happiness O
was O
in O
store O
for O
us O
. O
 O


 O
Is O
this O
true O
, O
what O
I O
see O
in O
the O
paper O
then O
? O
 O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
said O
— O
a O
paragraph O
in O


which O
had O
greatly O
surprised O
him O
. O


 O
It O
was O
true O
. O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
told O
me O
on O
Friday B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
the O
night O
of O
that O
fatal O


ball O
. O
He O
has O
been O
promised O
an O
appointment O
any O
time O
these B-DATE
six I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O
Mr. O


Martyr B-PERSON
, O
the O
Colonial B-ORG
Secretary O
, O
told O
him O
yesterday B-DATE
that O
it O
was O
made O
out O
. O


That O
unlucky O
arrest O
ensued O
; O
that O
horrible O
meeting O
. O
I O
was O
only O
guilty O
of O
too O


much O
devotedness O
to O
Rawdon B-GPE
’s O
service O
. O
I O
have O
received O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
alone O
a O


hundred B-CARDINAL
times O
before O
. O
I O
confess O
I O
had O
money O
of O
which O
Rawdon B-GPE
knew O
nothing O
. O


Do O
n’t O
you O
know O
how O
careless O
he O
is O
of O
it O
, O
and O
could O
I O
dare O
to O
confide O
it O
to O


him O
? O
 O
And O
so O
she O
went O
on O
with O
a O
perfectly O
connected O
story O
, O
which O
she O
poured O


into O
the O
ears O
of O
her O
perplexed O
kinsman O
. O


It O
was O
to O
the O
following O
effect O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
owned O
, O
and O
with O
perfect O
frankness O
, O


but O
deep O
contrition O
, O
that O
having O
remarked O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
partiality O
for O
her O


( O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
which O
Pitt B-PERSON
blushed O
) O
, O
and O
being O
secure O
of O
her O
own O
virtue O
, O


she O
had O
determined O
to O
turn O
the O
great O
peer O
’s O
attachment O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O


herself O
and O
her O
family O
. O
 O
I O
looked O
for O
a O
peerage O
for O
you O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
said O


( O
the O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
again O
turned O
red O
) O
. O
 O
We O
have O
talked O
about O
it O
. O
Your O
genius O


and O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
interest O
made O
it O
more O
than O
probable O
, O
had O
not O
this O
dreadful O


calamity O
come O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
all O
our O
hopes O
. O
But O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
own O
that O
it O
was O


my O
object O
to O
rescue O
my O
dear O
husband,—him O
whom O
I O
love O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
ill O


usage O
and O
suspicions O
of O
me,—to O
remove O
him O
from O
the O
poverty O
and O
ruin O
which O


was O
impending O
over O
us O
. O
I O
saw O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
partiality O
for O
me O
, O
 O
she O
said O
, O


casting O
down O
her O
eyes O
. O
 O
I O
own O
that O
I O
did O
everything O
in O
my O
power O
to O
make O


myself O
pleasing O
to O
him O
, O
and O
as O
far O
as O
an O
honest O
woman O
may O
, O
to O
secure O
his O
— O
his O


esteem O
. O
It O
was O
only O
on O
Friday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
that O
the O
news O
arrived O
of O
the O
death O
of O


the O
Governor O
of O
Coventry B-GPE
Island I-GPE
, O
and O
my O
Lord O
instantly O
secured O
the O


appointment O
for O
my O
dear O
husband O
. O
It O
was O
intended O
as O
a O
surprise O
for O
him,—he O


was O
to O
see O
it O
in O
the O
papers O
to O
- O
day O
. O
Even O
after O
that O
horrid O
arrest O
took O
place O


( O
the O
expenses O
of O
which O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
generously O
said O
he O
would O
settle O
, O
so O
that O


I O
was O
in O
a O
manner O
prevented O
from O
coming O
to O
my O
husband O
’s O
assistance O
) O
, O
my O
Lord O


was O
laughing O
with O
me O
, O
and O
saying O
that O
my O
dearest O
Rawdon B-PERSON
would O
be O
consoled O


when O
he O
read O
of O
his O
appointment O
in O
the O
paper O
, O
in O
that O
shocking O


spun O
— O
bailiff O
’s O
house O
. O
And O
then O
— O
then O
he O
came O
home O
. O
His O
suspicions O
were O


excited,—the O
dreadful O
scene O
took O
place O
between O
my O
Lord O
and O
my O
cruel O
, O
cruel O


Rawdon B-PERSON
— O
and O
, O
O O
my O
God O
, O
what O
will O
happen O
next O
? O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
dear O
Pitt B-PERSON
! O
pity O
me O
, O
and O


reconcile O
us O
! O
 O
And O
as O
she O
spoke O
she O
flung O
herself O
down O
on O
her O
knees O
, O
and O


bursting O
into O
tears O
, O
seized O
hold O
of O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
, O
which O
she O
kissed O


passionately O
. O


It O
was O
in O
this O
very O
attitude O
that O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
returning O
from O
church O
, O


ran O
to O
her O
husband O
’s O
room O
directly O
she O
heard O
Mrs. O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
was O


closeted O
there O
, O
found O
the O
Baronet O
and O
his O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O


 O
I O
am O
surprised O
that O
woman O
has O
the O
audacity O
to O
enter O
this O
house O
, O
 O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON


said O
, O
trembling O
in O
every O
limb O
, O
and O
turning O
quite O
pale O
. O
( O
Her O
ladyship O
had O


sent O
out O
her O
maid O
directly O
after O
breakfast O
, O
who O
had O
communicated O
with O


Raggles O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON

household O

who O
had O
told O
her O
all O

a O
great O


deal O
more O
than O
they O
knew O
, O
of O
that O
story O
, O
and O
many O
others O
besides O
. O
) O
 O
How O
dare O


Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
to O
enter O
the O
house O
of O
— O
of O
an O
honest O
family O
? O
 O


Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
started O
back O
, O
amazed O
at O
his O
wife O
’s O
display O
of O
vigour O
. O
Becky B-PERSON
still O


kept O
her O
kneeling O
posture O
, O
and O
clung O
to O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
. O


 O
Tell O
her O
that O
she O
does O
not O
know O
all O
. O
Tell O
her O
that O
I O
am O
innocent O
, O
dear O


Pitt B-PERSON
, O
 O
she O
whimpered O
out O
. O


 O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
my O
love O
, O
I O
think O
you O
do O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
injustice O
, O
 O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON


said O
; O
at O
which O
speech O
Rebecca B-PERSON
was O
vastly O
relieved O
. O
 O
Indeed O
I O
believe O
her O
to O


be O
— O
— O
 O


 O
To O
be O
what O
? O
 O
cried O
out O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
, O
her O
clear O
voice O
thrilling O
, O
and O
her O
heart O


beating O
violently O
as O
she O
spoke O
. O
 O
To O
be O
a O
wicked O
woman O
— O
a O
heartless O
mother O
, O
a O


false O
wife O
? O
She O
never O
loved O
her O
dear O
little O
boy O
, O
who O
used O
to O
fly O
here O
and O


tell O
me O
of O
her O
cruelty O
to O
him O
. O
She O
never O
came O
into O
a O
family O
but O
she O
strove O


to O
bring O
misery O
with O
her O
, O
and O
to O
weaken O
the O
most O
sacred O
affections O
with O
her O


wicked O
flattery O
and O
falsehood O
. O
She O
has O
deceived O
her O
husband O
, O
as O
she O
has O


deceived O
everybody O
; O
her O
soul O
is O
black O
with O
vanity O
, O
worldliness O
, O
and O
all O


sorts O
of O
crime O
. O
I O
tremble O
when O
I O
touch O
her O
. O
I O
keep O
my O
children O
out O
of O
her O


sight O
. O
I O
— O
— O
 O


 O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON
! O
 O
cried O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
starting O
up O
. O
 O
This O
is O
really O
language O
— O
— O
 O


 O
I O
have O
been O
a O
true O
and O
faithful O
wife O
to O
you O
, O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
 O
Lady O
Jane B-PERSON


continued O
, O
intrepidly O
; O
 O
I O
have O
kept O
my O
marriage O
vow O
as O
I O
made O
it O
to O
God O
, O
and O


have O
been O
obedient O

gentle O
as O
a O
wife O
should O
. O
But O
righteous O
obedience O
has O


its O
limits O
, O
and O
I O
declare O
that O
I O
will O
not O
bear O
that O
— O
that O
woman O
again O
under O


my O
roof O
: O
if O
she O
enters O
it O

I O
and O
my O

will O
leave O
it O

She O
is O
not O


worthy O
to O
sit O
down O
with O
Christian B-NORP
, O
people O
. O
You O
— O
you O
must O
choose O
, O
sir O

between O


her O

me O
; O
 O
and O
with O
this O
my O
Lady O
swept O
out O

fluttering O
with O


her O

audacity O
, O
and O
leaving O

not O

As O
for O

out O

and O
before O

left O
him O

Macmurdo B-GPE

He O

him O

There O
can O
scarcely O
be O

lower O

perhaps O

than O
his O

he O
was O
quite O
contented O

such O

perhaps O
, O


discontented O
at O

very O

 O
still O

Curzon B-FAC

Is O
the O

Has O

Upon O

his O

 O
I O
declare O
I O
think O
that O


your O

Mr. O


Macmurdo B-PERSON

 O
Mr. O


Wenham B-PERSON

with O

 O
I O

 O
I O

 O
Mr. O

continued O
with O
great O
solemnity O
; O


 O
I O
was O
sent O

my O
Lord O

found O
him O
in O

I O
need O
hardly O

Colonel O

I O


say O
to O
your O

it O
was O
a O
cruel O
advantage O
you O
took O
of O
that O
strength O

Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
. O
It O
was O
not O
only O
the O
body O
of O
my O
noble O
and O
excellent O
friend O


which O
was O
wounded O
— O
his O
heart O
, O
sir O
, O
was O
bleeding O
. O
A O
man O
whom O
he O
had O
loaded O


with O
benefits O
and O
regarded O
with O
affection O
, O
had O
subjected O
him O
to O
the O
foulest O


indignity O
. O
What O
was O
this O
very O
appointment O
, O
which O
appears O
in O
the O
journals O
of O


to O
- O
day O
, O
but O
a O
proof O
of O
his O
kindness O
to O
you O
? O
When O
I O
saw O
his O
Lordship O
this O


morning O
I O
found O
him O
in O
a O
state O
pitiable O
indeed O
to O
see O
: O
and O
as O
anxious O
as O
you O


are O
to O
revenge O
the O
outrage O
committed O
upon O
him O
, O
by O
blood O
. O
You O
know O
he O
has O


given O
his O
proofs O
, O
I O
presume O
, O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
? O
 O


 O
He O
has O
plenty O
of O
pluck O
, O
 O
said O
the O
Colonel O
. O
 O
Nobody O
ever O
said O
he O


had O
n’t O
. O
 O


 O
His O
first B-ORDINAL
order O
to O
me O
was O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
of O
challenge O
, O
and O
to O
carry O
it O


to O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
. O
One B-CARDINAL
or O
other O
of O
us O
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
 O
must O
not O
survive O
the O


outrage O
of O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME

 O


Crawley B-PERSON
nodded O
. O
 O
You O
’re O
coming O
to O
the O
point O
, O
Wenham B-ORG
, O
 O
he O
said O

 O
I O
tried O
my O
utmost O
to O
calm O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
. O
Good O
God O
! O
sir O
, O
 O
I O
said O
, O
 O
how O
I O


regret O
that O
Mrs. O
Wenham B-PERSON
and O
myself O
had O
not O
accepted O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
’s O


invitation O
to O
sup O
with O
her O
! O
 O


 O
She O
asked O
you O
to O
sup O
with O
her O
? O
 O
Captain O
Macmurdo B-PERSON
said O
. O


 O
After O
the O
Opera B-ORG
. O
Here O
’s O
the O
note O
of O
invitation O
— O
stop O
— O
no O
, O
this O
is O
another O


paper O
— O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
it O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
of O
no O
consequence O
, O
and O
I O
pledge O
you O
my O


word O
to O
the O
fact O
. O
If O
we O
had O
come O
— O
and O
it O
was O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
of O
Mrs. O
Wenham B-PERSON
’s O


headaches O
which O
prevented O
us O
— O
she O
suffers O
under O
them O
a O
good O
deal O
, O
especially O


in O
the B-DATE
spring I-DATE
— O
if O
we O
had O
come O
, O
and O
you O
had O
returned O
home O
, O
there O
would O
have O


been O
no O
quarrel O
, O
no O
insult O
, O
no O
suspicion O
— O
and O
so O
it O
is O
positively O
because O
my O


poor O
wife O
has O
a O
headache O
that O
you O
are O
to O
bring O
death O
down O
upon O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
of O


honour O
, O
and O
plunge O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
excellent O
and O
ancient O
families O
in O
the O


kingdom O
into O
disgrace O
and O
sorrow O
. O
 O


Mr. O
Macmurdo B-PERSON
looked O
at O
his O
principal O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
man O
profoundly O


puzzled O
: O
and O
Rawdon B-PERSON
felt O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
rage O
that O
his O
prey O
was O
escaping O
him O
. O


He O
did O
not O
believe O
a O
word O
of O
the O
story O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
how O
discredit O
or O
disprove O


it O
? O


Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
continued O
with O
the O
same O
fluent O
oratory O
, O
which O
in O
his O
place O
in O


parliament O
he O
had O
so O
often O
practised—I O
sate O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
or O
more O
by O
Lord O


Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
bedside O
, O
beseeching O
, O
imploring O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
to O
forego O
his O
intention O


of O
demanding O
a O
meeting O
. O
I O
pointed O
out O
to O
him O
that O
the O
circumstances O
were O


after O
all O
suspicious O
— O
they O
were O
suspicious O
. O
I O
acknowledge O
it,—any O
man O
in O
your O


position O
might O
have O
been O
taken O
in O
— O
I O
said O
that O
a O
man O
furious O
with O
jealousy O
is O


to O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
a O
madman O
, O
and O
should O
be O
as O
such O
regarded O
— O
that O
a O


duel O
between O
you O
must O
lead O
to O
the O
disgrace O
of O
all O
parties O
concerned O
— O
that O
a O


man O
of O
his O
Lordship O
’s O
exalted O
station O
had O
no O
right O
in O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
when O
the O


most O
atrocious O
revolutionary O
principles O
, O
and O
the O
most O
dangerous O
levelling O


doctrines O
are O
preached O
among O
the O
vulgar O
, O
to O
create O
a O
public O
scandal O
; O
and O


that O
, O
however O
innocent O
, O
the O
common O
people O
would O
insist O
that O
he O
was O
guilty O
. O


In O
fine O
, O
I O
implored O
him O
not O
to O
send O
the O
challenge O
. O
 O


 O
I O
do O
n’t O
believe O
one B-CARDINAL
word O
of O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
 O
said O
Rawdon B-PERSON
, O
grinding O
his O


teeth O
. O
 O
I O
believe O
it O
a O
d O
— O
— O
lie O
, O
and O
that O
you O
’re O
in O
it O
, O
Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON

If O
the O


challenge O
do O
n’t O
come O
from O
him O
, O
by O
Jove B-PERSON
it O
shall O
come O
from O
me O
. O
 O


Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
turned O
deadly O
pale O
at O
this O
savage O
interruption O
of O
the O
Colonel O
, O


and O
looked O
towards O
the O
door O
. O


But O
he O
found O
a O
champion O
in O
Captain O
Macmurdo B-PERSON
. O
That O
gentleman O
rose O
up O
with O
an O


oath O
, O
and O
rebuked O
Rawdon B-PERSON
for O
his O
language O
. O
 O
You O
put O
the O
affair O
into O
my O


hands O
, O
and O
you O
shall O
act O
as O
I O
think O
fit O
, O
by O
Jove B-PERSON
, O
and O
not O
as O
you O
do O
. O
You O


have O
no O
right O
to O
insult O
Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
with O
this O
sort O
of O
language O
; O
and O
dammy B-ORG
, O


Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
, O
you O
deserve O
an O
apology O
. O
And O
as O
for O
a O
challenge O
to O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
, O


you O
may O
get O
somebody O
else O
to O
carry O
it O

I O
wo O

If O
my O

after O
being O


thrashed O

chooses O
to O
sit O
still O
, O
dammy B-PERSON
let O
him O
. O
And O
as O
for O
the O
affair O


with O
— O
with O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O
my O
belief O
is O
, O
there O
’s O
nothing O
proved O
at O
all O
: O
that O


your O
wife O
’s O
innocent O
, O
as O
innocent O
as O
Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
says O
she O
is O
: O
and O
at O
any O


rate O
, O
that O
you O
would O
be O
a O
d O
— O
fool O
not O
to O
take O
the O
place O
and O
hold O
your O


tongue O
. O
 O


 O
Captain O
Macmurdo B-PERSON
, O
you O
speak O
like O
a O
man O
of O
sense O
, O
 O
Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
cried O
out O
, O


immensely O
relieved—I O
forget O
any O
words O
that O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
has O
used O
in O
the O


irritation O
of O
the O
moment O
. O
 O


 O
I O
thought O
you O
would O
, O
 O
Rawdon B-PERSON
said O
, O
with O
a O
sneer O
. O


 O
Shut O
your O
mouth O
, O
you O
old O
stoopid O
, O
 O
the O
Captain O
said O
, O
good O
- O
naturedly O
. O
 O
Mr. O


Wenham B-PERSON
ai O
n’t O
a O
fighting O
man O
; O
and O
quite O
right O
, O
too O
. O
 O


 O
This O
matter O
, O
in O
my O
belief O
, O
 O
the O
Steyne B-ORG
emissary O
cried O
, O
 O
ought O
to O
be O
buried O


in O
the O
most O
profound O
oblivion O
. O
A O
word O
concerning O
it O
should O
never O
pass O
these O


doors O
. O
I O
speak O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
my O
friend O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
Colonel O
Crawley B-PERSON
, O


who O
persists O
in O
considering O
me O
his O
enemy O

 O


 O
I O
suppose O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
wo O
n’t O
talk O
about O
it O
very O
much O
, O
 O
said O
Captain O


Macmurdo B-PERSON
; O
 O
and O
I O
do O

see O
why O
our O
side O
should O
. O
The O
affair O
ai O
n’t O
a O
very O


pretty O
one O

any O
way O
you O
take O
it O
; O
and O
the O
less O
said O
about O
it O
the O
better O
. O
It O
’s O


you O
are O
thrashed O
, O
and O
not O
us O
; O
and O
if O
you O
are O
satisfied O
, O
why O
, O
I O
think O
, O
we O


should O
be O
. O
 O


Mr. O
Wenham B-PERSON
took O
his O
hat O
, O
upon O
this O
, O
and O
Captain O
Macmurdo B-PERSON
following O
him O
to O


the O
door O
, O
shut O
it O
upon O
himself O
and O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON
’s O
agent O
, O
leaving O
Rawdon B-GPE


chafing O
within O
. O
When O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
were O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
Macmurdo B-GPE
looked O
hard O
at O


the O
other O
ambassador O
, O
and O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
anything O
but O
respect O
on O
his O


round O

 O
You O
do O
n’t O
stick O
at O
a O
trifle O

Mr. O

, O
 O
he O
said O
. O


 O
You O
flatter O
me O
, O
Captain O
Macmurdo B-PERSON

 O
answered O
the O
other O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
. O
 O
Upon O


my O
honour O
and O
conscience O
now O
, O
Mrs. O
Crawley B-PERSON
did O
ask O
us O
to O
sup O
after O
the O


Opera B-WORK_OF_ART

 O


 O
Of O
course O
; O
and O
Mrs. O

had O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
head O

I O
say O

I O
’ve O

a O

I O

I O
will O
put O

in O
an O

for O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON

My O
man O
sha O
n’t O
fight O
him O
. O
But O
we O
had O
rather O
not O
take O
his O
money O
. O
 O


 O
It O
was O
all O
a O
mistake,—all O
a O
mistake O
, O
my O
dear O
sir O
, O
 O
the O
other O
said O
, O
with O


the O
utmost O
innocence O
of O
manner O
; O
and O
was O
bowed O
down O
the O
Club B-ORG
steps O
by O
Captain O


Macmurdo B-PERSON
, O
just O
as O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
ascended O
them O
. O
There O
was O
a O
slight O


acquaintance O
between O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
gentlemen O
; O
and O
the O
Captain O
, O
going O
back O
with O


the O
Baronet O
to O
the O
room O
where O
the O
latter O
’s O
brother O
was O
, O
told O
Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O
in O


confidence O
, O
that O
he O
had O
made O
the O
affair O
all O
right O
between O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON

the O
Colonel O

Sir O
Pitt B-PERSON
was O
well O
pleased O
, O
of O
course O
, O
at O
this O
intelligence O
; O
and O


congratulated O
his O
brother O
warmly O
upon O
the O
peaceful O
issue O
of O
the O
affair O
, O


making O
appropriate O
moral O
remarks O
upon O
the O
evils O
of O
duelling O
, O
and O
the O


unsatisfactory O
nature O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
settlement O
of O
disputes O
. O


And O
after O
this O
preface O
, O
he O
tried O
with O
all O
his O
eloquence O
to O
effect O
a O


reconciliation O
between O
Rawdon B-PERSON
and O
his O
wife O
. O
He O
recapitulated O
the O
statements O


which O
Becky B-PERSON
had O
made O
, O
pointed O
out O
the O
probabilities O
of O
their O
truth O
, O
and O


asserted O
his O
own O
firm O
belief O
in O
her O
innocence O
. O


But O
Rawdon B-PERSON
would O
not O
hear O
of O
it O
. O
 O
She O
has O
kep O
money O
concealed O
from O
me O
these O


ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
 O
he O
said O
. O
 O
She O
swore O
, O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
only O
, O
she O
had O
none O
from O
Steyne B-ORG

She O
knew O
it O
was O
all O
up O

directly O
I O
found O
it O
. O
If O
she O
’s O
not O
guilty O
, O
Pitt B-PERSON
, O


she O
’s O
as O
bad O
as O
guilty O
; O
and O
I O
’ll O
never O
see O
her O
again,—never O

 O
His O
head O
sank O


down O
on O
his O
chest O

he O
spoke O
the O
words O

he O
looked O
quite O
broken O

sad O

 O
Macmurdo B-ORG

shaking O
his O

Rawdon B-PERSON
Crawley I-PERSON
resisted O

some O

the O
idea O

taking O
the O
place O
which O


had O
been O
procured O
for O
him O
by O
so O
odious O
a O

was O
also O
for O
removing O


the O
boy O
from O
the O
school O
where O
Lord O
Steyne B-PERSON

interest O
had O
placed O
him O
. O
He O
was O


induced O

however O

to O
acquiesce O
in O
these O
benefits O
by O
the O
entreaties O
of O
his O


brother O
and O
Macmurdo B-PERSON
: O
but O
mainly O
by O
the O
latter O
pointing O
out O
to O
him O
what O
a O


fury O
Steyne B-ORG
would O
be O
in O
, O
to O
think O
that O
his O

When O

by O

Latin B-NORP

a O

who O
could O
buy O
up O
half B-CARDINAL

He O
would O
mourn O
now O

in O
a O

that O
his O

When O

pretending O
to O
understand O
little O
George B-PERSON
when O
he O


spoke O
regarding O
them O

He O
made O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
blunders O

showed O
his O

many O
a O

It O
did O
not O

the O

had O
for O

senior O

A O
quick O
brain O
and O
a O
better O

elsewhere O
showed O
the O
boy O
very O


soon O
that O
his O
grandsire O
was O
a O
dullard O
; O
and O
he O
began O
accordingly O
to O
command O


him O

to O
look O
down O
upon O
him O
; O
for O
his O
previous O
education O
, O
humble O

contracted O
as O
it O

had O
made O

no O

about O


him O

whose O

was O
so O
pure O

so O
meek O

that O
she O

not O

Young B-PERSON
Georgy I-PERSON
lorded O
over O
this O
soft O

nature O
: O

the O
contrast O
of O


its O

of O
the O

Whilst O
his O

do O
believe O
every B-TIME

of O
the O
sad O

this O
young O

had O
a O
number O
of O
pleasures O

administered O
to O
him O

made O
him O

at O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
piece O

she O

She O
had O

with O

a O

in O

he O


pulled O
a O

for O
the O

that O

begged O
George B-PERSON

 O

 O
as O
Mr. O

loved O

the O
young O

Hart B-FAC

The O

an O

a O

descanted O
upon O
the O

the O

of O

there O

so O
that O
audiences O
would O
gather O

him O

he O


spoke O

and O
all O
Bloomsbury B-ORG
highly O
admired O
him O
as O
a O
prodigiously O

man O

And O
whenever O
he O
spoke O
( O
which O
he O
did O
almost O

, O
he O
took O
care O
to O


produce O
the O
very O
finest O

longest O
words O
of O
which O
the O
vocabulary O
gave O
him O


the O
use O

rightly O
judging O

that O
it O
was O
as O
cheap O
to O
employ O
a O
handsome O

sonorous O
epithet O

The O

. O
Very O
true O
; O
but O
think O
how O
mysterious O

often O
unaccountable O
it O


is O
— O
that O

So O
I O
must O
own O

that O
without O

on O
the O

something O


akin O

Amelia B-PERSON

in O

all O

she O


did O
not O

I O

The O

They O
buried O
Amelia B-PERSON

mother O
in O
the O
churchyard O
at O
Brompton B-GPE
; O
upon O
just O
such O
a O


rainy O
, O
dark O
day O
, O
as O
Amelia B-PERSON
recollected O
when O
first B-ORDINAL
she O
had O
been O
there O
to O


marry O
George B-PERSON
. O
Her O
little O
boy O
sate O
by O
her O
side O
in O
pompous O
new O
sables O
. O
She O


remembered O
the O
old O
pew O
- O
woman O
and O
clerk O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
away O
in O
other O


times O
as O
the O
parson O
read O
. O
But O
that O
she O
held O
George B-PERSON
’s O
hand O
in O
her O
own O
, O


perhaps O
she O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
change O
places O
with O
… O
Then O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
she O


felt O
ashamed O
of O
her O
selfish O
thoughts O
, O
and O
prayed O
inwardly O
to O
be O
strengthened O


to O
do O
her O
duty O
. O


So O
she O
determined O
with O
all O
her O
might O
and O
strength O
to O
try O
and O
make O
her O
old O


father O
happy O
. O
She O
slaved O
, O
toiled O
, O
patched O
, O
and O
mended O
, O
sang O
and O
played O


backgammon O
, O
read O
out O
the O
newspaper O
, O
cooked O
dishes O
, O
for O
old O
Sedley B-PERSON
, O
walked O


him O
out O
sedulously O
into O
Kensington B-FAC
Gardens I-FAC
or O
the B-FAC
Brompton I-FAC
Lanes I-FAC
, O
listened O


to O
his O
stories O
with O
untiring O
smiles O
and O
affectionate O
hypocrisy O
, O
or O
sate O


musing O
by O
his O
side O
and O
communing O
with O
her O
own O
thoughts O
and O
reminiscences O
, O
as O


the O
old O
man O
, O
feeble O
and O
querulous O
, O
sunned O
himself O
on O
the O
garden O
benches O
and O


prattled O
about O
his O
wrongs O
or O
his O
sorrows O
. O


What O
sad O
, O
unsatisfactory O
thoughts O
those O
of O
the O
widow O
were O
! O
The O
children O


running O
up O
and O
down O
the O
slopes O
and O
broad O
paths O
in O
the O
gardens O
, O
reminded O
her O


of O
George B-PERSON
who O
was O
taken O
from O
her O
: O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
George B-PERSON
was O
taken O
from O
her O
: O
her O


selfish O
, O
guilty O
love O
, O
in O
both O
instances O
, O
had O
been O
rebuked O
and O
bitterly O


chastised O
. O
She O
strove O
to O
think O
it O
was O
right O
that O
she O
should O
be O
so O
punished O
. O


She O
was O
such O
a O
miserable O
wicked O
sinner O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
alone O
in O
the O


world O
. O


I O
know O
that O
the O
account O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
solitary O
imprisonment O
is O


insufferably O
tedious O
, O
unless O
there O
is O
some O
cheerful O
or O
humorous O
incident O
to O


enliven O
it,—a B-NORP
tender O
gaoler B-PERSON
, O

Perhaps O
the O

guessed O
who O
was O
the O


stout O

called O
upon O
Georgy B-PERSON
at O
his O

in O

with O
our O

Major O
Dobbin B-PERSON

It O
was O
another O

never O

had O
directed O

such O

that O
he O


arrived O

his O

a O
state O
of O

it O
was O
thought O
for O
many O

many O

that O

farther O

the O

Here O

as O
the O
poor O

lay O
tossing O

the O
people O
who O
watched O


him O
might O

heard O
him O
raving O
about O
Amelia B-PERSON

The O
idea O
that O
he O
should O
never O


see O
her O
again O
depressed O
him O
in O
his B-TIME
lucid I-TIME
hours I-TIME

He O
thought O
his O
last B-DATE

was O


come O

he O
made O
his O
solemn O

The O

He O
desired O

a O


little O

which O
, O
if O
the O

from O
Amelia B-PERSON

blood O

the O

almost O

Captain O

and O
so O
weak O

prostrate O
, O
that O
his O
friend O
who O
had O
tended O
him O
through O
his O


illness O
, O
prophesied O
that O
the O
honest O
Major O
would O
never O
survive O
the O

and O
that O
he O
would O
pass O
some B-TIME

over O
the O

down O

him O
the O

But O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
sea O

or O
the O
hope O
which O
sprung O
up O
in O


him O
afresh O
, O
from O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
that O
the O
ship O
spread O
her O
canvas O
and O
stood O
out O
of O


the O
roads O
towards O

home O
, O

our O
friend O
began O
to O
amend O
, O
and O
he O
was O
quite O


well O
( O
though O
as O
gaunt O
as O
a O
greyhound O
) O
before O
they O
reached O
the O
Cape B-LOC
. O
 O
Kirk B-PERSON


will O
be O
disappointed O
of O
his O
majority O
this O
time O
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
: O
 O
he O


will O
expect O
to O
find O
himself O
gazetted O
by O
the O
time O
the O
regiment O
reaches O
home O

 O


For O
it O
must O
be O
premised O
that O
while O
the O
Major O
was O
lying O
ill O
at O
Madras B-GPE
, O
having O


made O
such O
prodigious O
haste O
to O
go O
thither O
, O
the O
gallant O

, O
which O
had O
passed O


many O
years O
abroad O
, O
which O
after O
its O
return O
from O
the B-GPE
West I-GPE

had O
been O


baulked O
of O
its O
stay O

the O
Waterloo B-GPE
campaign O

and O
had O
been O
ordered O


from O
Flanders B-GPE
to O
India B-GPE
, O
had O
received O
orders O
home O

and O
the O
Major O
might O
have O


accompanied O
his O
comrades O
had O
he O
chosen O
to O
wait O
for O
their O
arrival O
at O


Madras B-GPE

Perhaps O
he O
was O
not O
inclined O
to O
put O
himself O
in O
his O
exhausted O
state O
again O


under O
the O
guardianship O
of O
Glorvina B-GPE

 O
I O
think O
Miss O
O’Dowd B-PERSON
would O
have O
done O
for O


me O
, O
 O
he O
said O
, O
laughingly O
, O
to O
a O
fellow O

passenger O
, O
 O
if O
we O
had O
had O
her O
on O


board O

when O

me O

she O
would O
have O
fallen O

depend O

it O

carried O
you O
in O
as O
a O

 O


For O
indeed O
it O
was O
no O
other O
than O
our O
stout O

was O
also O
a O

on O

the O

had O


their O
effect O
upon O
Waterloo B-PERSON
Sedley I-PERSON

A O
voyage O

was O
pronounced O


necessary O
for O
him O

having O
served O
his O
full O
time O
in O
India B-GPE

had O
fine O


appointments O

had O
enabled O
him O
to O
lay O
by O
a O
considerable O

he O


was O
free O

resume O


that O

which O
his O
seniority O

entitled O
him O

He O
was O
rather O
thinner O

saw O
him O

had O
gained O
in O
majesty O

solemnity O

He O
had O
resumed O
the O
mustachios O

his O

swaggered O
about O

Mr. O

In O

it O

the O

how O
