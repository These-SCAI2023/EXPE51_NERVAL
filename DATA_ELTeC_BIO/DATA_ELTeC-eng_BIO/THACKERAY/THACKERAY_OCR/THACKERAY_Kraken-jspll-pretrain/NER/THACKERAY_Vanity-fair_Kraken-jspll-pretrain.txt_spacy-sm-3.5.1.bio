Mr. O

Some O
cynical O
Frenchman B-NORP

has O

: O
the O
one O

the O
other O
who O
condescended O
to O
be O

the O
low O
is O

: O
perhaps O
on O

Perhaps O
some O

infatuated O
swain O
has O
ere O

for O
modesty O
, O

consigning O

a O
poison O
on O

little O

George B-PERSON

twice O

thrice O
- O
low O
many O
times O
Amelia B-GPE

scarcely O

She O
sate O
quite O
unnoticed O
in O
her O
corner O
, O
except O
when O
|
| O
Rawdon B-GPE
came O
up O
with O
some O
words O
of O
clumsy O
conversation O
: O
and O
later O
in O
|
| O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
Captain O
Dobbin B-PERSON
made O
so O
bold O
as O
to O
bring O
her O
refresh- O

| O
months B-DATE
and O
sit O
beside O
her O
. O
He O
did O
not O
like O
to O
ask O
her O
why O
she O
was O
so O
sad O
; O
|
| O
but O
as O
a O
pretext O
for O
the O
cars O
which O
were O
filling O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
she O
told O
him O
|
| O
that O
Mrs. O
Crowley B-PERSON
had O
alarmed O
ler O
by O
telling O
her O
that O
George B-PERSON
would O
go O
on O
|
| O
playing O
. O
|
| O
It O
is O
furious O
, O
when O
a O
man O
is O
bent O
upon O
play O
, O
by O
what O
clumsy O
rogues O

he O
will O
allow O
himself O
to O
be O
cheated O

'' O
Dobbin B-PERSON

; O

Emmy B-PERSON
said O
, O

` O
Indeed O
. O
'' O
She O
was O
thinking O
of O
something O
else O

It O
was O
to O
the O
loss O
of O

the O
money O

At O

She O
was O

going O

did O
not O
even O
coalesced O
to O
come O

say O
good O

bye O
to O

The O
poor O
girl O
let O
her O
husband O
come O

go O
without O
saying O

an O
word O
, O
and O
her O
head O
fell O
on O
her O
breasts O
. O
Dobbin B-PERSON
had O
been O
called O
away O
, O
|
| O
and O
was O
whispering O
deep O
in O
conversation O
with O
the O
general O
of O
the O
division O
, O
|
| O
his O
friend O

had O
not O

this O
last O
parting O

George B-PERSON
went O
away O
then O

with O
the O
bouquet O
; O

when O
he O
gave O
it O
to O
the O

, O
there O
lay O
a O
note O
, O
coiled O

like O

snake O
among O
the O
flowers O
. O
Rebecca B-PERSON
's O
eye O
caught O
it O
at O
once O
. O
She O
|
| O
had O
been O
used O
to O
deal O
with O
notes O
in O
early O
life O
. O
She O
put O
out O
her O
hand O
and O
|
| O
took O
the O
nosegay O
. O
He O
saw O
by O
her O
eyes O
as O
they O
get O
, O
that O
she O
was O
aware O
|
| O
what O
she O
should O
find O
there O
. O
Her O
husband O
hurried O
her O
away O
, O
still O
too O

intent O
upon O
his O
own O
thoughts O

seemingly O
, O
to O
take O
note O

any O
marks O
of O

recognition O
which O
might O
pass O
between O
his O
friend O

These O

were O
, O
however O
, O

trifling O

became O

George B-PERSON
her O
hand O
with O

her O
usual O
quick O

made O
a O
curtsey O

walked O
away O

George B-PERSON
bowed O
over O
the O

nothing O

it O

I O
wonder O

it O
because O

are O
cowards O
in O

that O
they O
admire O

so O

place O

, O
at O
the O

George B-PERSON

not O
without O
a O
feeling O

of O
shame O
( O
although O
his O
wife O

hold O
on O
him O
had O
been O

feeble O
) O
, O
that O
he O

should O
have O
been O
detained O
there O
so O
long O
. O
The O
same O
feeling O

was O
amongst O

Mrs. O

She O
asked O

she O
referred O
them O
pointedly O

Mrs. O

Sla O

never O
ventured O

well O

Sle O
would O
not O

her O

she O
was O
not O

might O

And O
whenever O

she O

such O
a O
sarcastic O

whom O
he O

the O

when O

she O
was O
uneasy O

that O

little O

the O

so O

that O
the O
widow O

|

heart O
thrilled O
as O
she O
held O
him O
to O
it O
; O
and O
he O
would O
often O
ask O
the O
cause O
|
| O
of O
her O
tears O
. O
It O
was O
because O
of O
his O
likeness O

his O
father O
, O
she O
did O
not O

scruple O
to O

She O
talked O
constantly O
to O
him O
about O
this O
dead O
father O
, O
|

and O
spoke O
of O
her O
love O
for O
George B-PERSON
to O
the O
innocent O
and O
wondering O
child O
; O
|
| O
much O
more O
than O
she O
ever O
had O
done O
to O
George B-PERSON
himself O
, O
or O
to O
any O
confidante O

of O
her O

To O
her O

she O

talked O

matter O
: O
shrink- O

in O
from O
baring O
her O
heart O
to O
them O
. O
Little O
George B-PERSON
very O
likely O
could O
under- O
|
| O
stand O
no O
better O
than O
the O
; O
but O
into O
his O
ears O
she O
poured O
her O
sentimental O
|
| O
secrets O
unreservedly O
, O
and O
into O
his O
only O
. O
The O
very O
joy O
of O
this O
woman O
was O
|
| O
a O
sort O
of O
grief O
, O
or O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
its O
expression O
was O
tears O
. O
Her O
|
| O
sensibilities O
were O
so O
weak O
and O
tremulous O
, O
that O
perhaps O
they O
ought O
not O
to O
|
| O
be O
talked O
about O
in O
a O
book O
. O
I O
was O
told O
by O
Dr. O
Pestler B-PERSON
, O
( O
now O
a O
most O
|
| O
flourishing O
lady O

physician O

with O
a O

of O
speedy O
knighthood O
, O
and O
a O
house O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
square O
, O
) O
that O
her O
|
| O
grief O
at O
weaning O
the O
child O
was O
a O
sight O
that O
would O
have O
unmanned O
a O
Herod B-PERSON
. O
|
| O
He O
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
and O
his O
wife O
was O
mortally O
jealous O
|
| O
of O
Mrs. O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
then O
and O
long O
afterwards O
. O
|
| O
Perhaps O
the O
Doctor O
's O
lady O
had O
good O
reason O
for O
her O
jealousy O
: O
most O
|
| O
women O
shared O
it O
, O
of O
those O
who O
formed O
the O
small O
circle O
of O
Amelia B-GPE
's O
|
| O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
were O
quite O
angry O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
the O
|
| O
other O
sex O
regarded O
her O
. O
For O
almost O
all O
men O
who O
came O
near O
her O
loved O
|
| O
her O
; O
though O
no O
doubt O
they O
would O
be O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
She O
was O
|
| O
to O
brilliant O
, O
nor O
witty O
, O
nor O
wise O
overcome O
, O
nor O
extraordinarily O
handsome O
. O
|
| O
But O
wherever O
she O
went O
she O
touched O
and O
charmed O
every O
one O
of O
the O
male O
|
| O
sex O
, O
as O
invariably O
as O
she O
awakened O
the O
scorn O
and O
inerelulity O
of O
her O
own O
|
| O
sisterhood O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
her O
weakness O
which O
was O
her O
principal O
charm:- O
|
| O
a O
kind O
of O
sweet O
submission O
and O
softness O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
appeal O
to O
each O
|
| O
man O
she O
met O
for O
his O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
in O
the O

though O
she O
spoke O

to O

the O

Her O

that O

my O

mistaken O

it O

his O
behaviour O

Colonel O

he O

began O

, O
perhaps O
, O

it O

indeed O
never O
succeeded O

Probably O

quite O
astonished O

Gaunt B-FAC

knowing O
that O
with O
him O
for O

Mrs. O

would O
|

not O
try O
to O
force O
her O

and O
she O
looked O
curiously O
at O
the O
superscriptions O

of O
all O
the O
letters O
which O
arrived O
for O
Sir O

, O
lest O
he O

his O
sister O

in O

should O
be O
corresponding O

Not O

that O
Rebecca B-PERSON
could O
have O
written O

she O
a O

she O
did O
not O
try O

to O
write O
to O
Pitt B-PERSON
at O
his O
own O

house O
, O
and O
after O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
attempts O
consented O
to O
his O
demand O
that O
the O

should O
be O
carried O

The O
fact O
was O
, O
that O
Pitt B-PERSON

had O
been O
poisoned O
against O
her O

A O

astonished O
