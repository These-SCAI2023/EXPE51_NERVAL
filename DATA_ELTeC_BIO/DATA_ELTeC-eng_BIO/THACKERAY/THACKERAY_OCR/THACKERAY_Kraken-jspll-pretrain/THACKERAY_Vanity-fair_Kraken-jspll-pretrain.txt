BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
As the MAnager of the Performance sits before the
curtain on the boards, and looks into the Fair, a feeling of
profound melancholy comes over him in his survey of the
bustling place. There is a great quantity of eating'and drink-
in, making love and lilting, laughing and the contrary,
smoking, cheating, fighting, dancing, and fiddling: there are
bullies pushing about, bucks ogling the women, knives picking
pockets, policemen on the look-out, quacks (other quacks,
plague take them l) bawling in front of their booths, and yokels
looking up at the installed dancers and poor old rouge
tumblers, while the light-fingered folk are operating upon their
pockets behind. Yes, this is VErY FAIn; not a moral place
certainly; nor a merry one, though very noisy. Look at the
faces of the actors and buffoons when they come off from their
business; and Tom Fool washing the paint off his checks before
he sits down to dinner with his wife and the little Jack
Puddings behind the canvass. The curtain will be up presently,
and he will be turning over head and heels, and crying,
How are you of ''
A man with a reflective turn of mind, walking through
viii
BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
an exhibition of this sort, will not be oppressed, I take it, by
his own or other people's hilarity. An episode of humour or
kindness touches and amuses him here and there;-a pretty
child looking at a gingerbread stall; a pretty girl blushing
whilst her lower talks to her and chooses her fairing; poor Tom
Fool, yonder behind the wagon, mumbling his bone with the
honest family which lives by his tumbling;-but the general
impression is one more melancholy than faithful. When you
come home, you sit down, in a sober, contemplative, not
unchnaritable frame of mind, and apply yourself to your books
or your business.
I have no other moral than this to tag to the present
story of  Vanity Fair'' Some people consider Fairs immoral
altogether, and eschew such, with their servants and families:
perhaps they are right. But persons who think otherwise and
are of a day, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood, may perhaps
like to step in for half an hour and look at the performances.
There are scenes of all sorts; some dreadful combats, some
grand and lofty horse-riding, some scenes of high life, and some
of very middling indeed; some love making for the sentimental,
and some light comic business: the whole accompanied by
appropriate scenery, and brilliantly illuminated with the
Author's own candles.
What more has the Manager of the Performance to say ?'-
To acknowledge the kindness witli which it has been received
in all the principal towns of England through which the Show
has passed, and where it has been most favourably noticed
by the respected conductors of the Public Press, and by the
Nobility and Gentry. He is proud to think that his Puppets
have given satisfaction to the very best company in this empire.
BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
The famous little Becky Puppet kas been pronounced to be
uncommonly flexible in the joints and lively on the wire: the
Amelia Doll, though it has had a smaller circle of admirers,
has yet been cared and dressed with the greatest care by
the artist : the Dobbin Figure, though apparently clumsy, yet
dances in a very amusing and natural manner: the Little Boys'
Dance has been liked by some; and please to remark the richly
dressed figure of the Wicked Nobleman, on which no expense
has been spared, and which Old Nick will fetch away at the
end of this singular performance.
And with this, and a profound bow to his patrons, the
MAnager retires, and the curtain rises.

its teens, and on one sun-pliny
morning in June, there drove
up to the great iron gate of Miss
Pinkerton's academy for young
Ladies, on Chiswick Mall, a large
family coach, with two fut horses
in blazing harness, driven by a
fat coaching in a three-cornered
hat and win, at the rate of four
miles an hour. A black servant,
who reposed on the box beside
the fat cochrane, unfurled his
bandy legs as soon as the equip-
page drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's shining brass plate, and s he
pulled the bell, at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of
the narrow windows of the stately old brick house. Nay, the acute
observer might have recognised the little red nose of good-naturel Miss
Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising or some geranium-pots in the window
of that lady's own drawing-room.
' It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister,'' said Miss Jemima. Sambo, the
black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coaching has a new rel
waistcoat.''
` Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss
Begley's departure, Miss Jemima P'' asked Miss Pinkerton herself, that
majestie lady: the emiramis of IIammersmith, the friend of Doctor
Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Capone herself.
 The girls were up at four this morning, packing her tanks, sister,'i
replied Miss Jemima; '`we have made her a bow-pot.''
vANITY FAIR.
 Say a bouquet, sister Jemima, 'tis more genteel.''
 Well, a book as big almost as a way-stack; I have put up two
bottles of the gillyflower-water for Mrs. Sedley, and the receipt for
making it, in Amelia's bor.''
''And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of Miss Sedley's

account. This is it, is it Very good-ninety-three pounds, four ship-
lings. Be kind enough to address it to John Sedlcy, Esquire, and to see
this billet which I had written to his lady.''
In Miss Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister, Miss Pinker-
ton, was an object of as deep veneration, as would have been a letter from
a sovereign. Only when her pupils quieted the establishment, or when
they were about to be married, and once, when poor Miss Birch died of
the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to write personally to the
parents of her pupils; and it was Jemima's opinion that if anything cold
console Mrs. Birch for her daughter's loss, it would be that pious and
eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced the event.
In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's `` millet'' was to the following
effect:-
 7he Mall, Holistic, June 15, 168-.
` MAx,-After her six years' residence at the Man, I have the
honour and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Scdley to her parents,
I
A NOEL WITHOUT A HER0.
as a young lady not worthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished
and refined circle. Those virtues which characterise the young English
gentleman, those accomplishments which become her birth and station,
will not be found wanting in the viable Miss Selley, whose industry
and obedience hae endeared her to her instructors, and whose delightful
sweetness of temper has charmed her aged and her fulfil companions.
'`In music, in dancing, in orthography, in every variety of embroidery
and needle-work, she will be found to have realised her friends' fodet
dishes. In geography there is still much to be desired; and a careful
and undeviating use of the backboard, for four hours daily during the
next three years, is recommended as necessary to the requirement of that
dignified deportment and carriage, so requisite for every young lady of fashion.
 In the principles of religion and morality, Miss edley will be found
worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of1
The Great Leicograpler, and the patronage of the ndmirnbhle Mrs. Cha-
one. In leaving the MAll, Miss Anglia carries with her the hearts of her
companions, and the affectionate regards of her mistress, who has the
honour to subscribe herself,
Malam,
 Your most obliged humble servant,
BABBAA PINETON.''
eP.S. Miss Sharp accompanies Miss Sedley. It is particularly re-
request that Miss Sharp's stay in russell Square may not excel ten days.
The family of distinction with whom she is engaged, desire to avail them-
seles of her services as soon as possible,''
The letter completed, Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name,
and Miss Sedley's, in the fly-leaf of a Johnson's Dictionary-the inter-
testing work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on their
departure from the Mall. On the cover was inserted a copy of `` Lines
addressed to a young lnty on quitting Miss Pinkerton's school, at the
Mall ; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson.'' In fact, the Lcci-
biographer's nme was always on the lips of this majestic woman, and a
visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune.
Being commanded by her elder sister to get ``the Dictionary'' from the
cupboard, Miss Jemims hd extracted two copies of the hook from the
receptacle in question. When Miss Pinkerton had finished the inscrip-
tion in the first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air, handed her
the second.
 or who is this, Miss Jemima ?'' said Miss Pinkerton, with awful
boldness.
 or Becky Sharp,'' answered Jemima, trembling very much, and
blushing over her withered face and neck, as she turned her back on
her sister. For Becky Sharp : she's going too.''
MISS JEMIMA .'' exelsimcd Miss Pinkerton, in to largest capitals.
``Are you in your senses? Replace the Ordinary in the closet, and neer
venture to take such a liberty in future.''
WII, sister, it's only two-and-inference, and poor Becky will be
miserable if she won't get one.''
n 2
VANITY AIIb.
Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,'' said Miss Pinkerton. And so
capturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly
tlurried aud nervous.
MIss Sedley's papa was a merchant in London, nan s man of some
called; whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil, for whom Miss ink-
eaton had done, as she thought, quite enough, without conferring upon her
at parting, the high honour of the bDixonary.
Although Schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more or less
than churchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person
reports this life, who is really deserving of all the prices the stone-cutter
carvcs over his bones; who is a good Christian, a good parent, child, wife or
husband; who actually does leave a disconsolute family to mourn his loss;
so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs every now and then,
that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bestowed by the disinterested
instructor. Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular
species; and deserved not only all that Miss pinkerton said in her praise, 
but had many charming qualities which that pompous old Minerva of a
woman could not see, from the differences of rank and age between her
pupil and herself.
For she could not only sing like a mark, or a Mrs. Billington, and dance
like Hillisberg or 'prison; and embroidery beautifully; and spell as well as
the Ordinary itself; but she had such a kindly, smiling, tender, gentle,
generous heart of her own, ns won the love of everybody who cme near
er, from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery, and the
one-eyed catwoman's daughter, who was permitted to end her wares once
a week to the young ladies in the Mall. She had twelve intimate and
bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies. Even envious Miss
Briggs never spoke ill of ler: high and mighty Miss Culture (Lord Dexter's
grand-daughter) allowed that her figure was genteel: and as for MIss
nitz, the rich woolly-haired mulatto from S5t. Kitt's, on the day Amelia
went away, she was in such a passion of tens, that they were obliged to
send for Dr. TFlops, and half satisfy her with salvolatile. Miss Pinkerton's
uttachcnt was, as may be supposed, from the high position and eminent
virtues of that lady, calm nd liguified; but Miss Jemima had already
blubberecl several times at the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear
of her sister, would have gone off in downright hysterics, like the heiress
(who pail double) of St. Kitt's. Such luxury of grief, however, is only
allowed to parlour-boarders. Honest Jemima lad all the bills, and the
washing, and the mendiug, and the puddings, and the plate and crockery,
and the servants to superintend. But why speak about her It is
probable that we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end
of time, and that when the great filligrec iron gates are once closed on
her, she and her awful sister will never issue tlerefrom into this little
world of history.
But as we are to see a great deal of Amelia, there is no harm in saying
at the outset of our acquaintance, that she was one of the best and densest
creatures that ever lived; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in
novels, which (and the latter especially) abound in villains of the most
sombre sort, that we are to have for a constant companion, so guilelcss

and good-naturel a person. As she is not a heroine, there is no need to
describe her person ; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short
than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a
heroine; but her face flushed with rosy health, and her lips with the
freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes, which sparkled with the
brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled with
tears, and that was a great deal too often ; for the silly thing would cry
over a dead canary-bird, or over a mouse, that the cat haply had seized
upon, or over the end of n novel, were it ever so stupid; and is for saying
an unkind word to her, were any one hard-hearted enough to do so,-
why, so much the worse for them. Even Miss Pinkerton, the austere
and god-like woman, ceased scolding cr after the first time, and though
she no more comprehended sensibility than she did Algebra, gave all
masters and teachers particular orders to trent Miss Sedley with the utmost
gentleness, as harsh treatment was injurious to her.
So that when the day of departure cme, between her two customs of
laughing and crying, Miss Sedley was greatly pulled how tract. She was
glad to go home, and yet most woefully sad at leaving school. For turkey
days before, little Laura Martin, the orphan, followed her about, like a
little dog. She had to make and receive at least fourteen presents,-to
make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week: ``Send my letters
under cover to my grandpa, the Earl of Dexter,'' said Miss Satire (who,
by the way was rather shabby) : `` Never mind the posture, but write every
day, you dear darling,'' said the impetuous and woolly-headed, but gene-
ous anl affectionate Miss Swartz; and little Laura Martin (who was just
in round and) took her friend's land and said, looking up in her face
wistfully, `Amelia, when I write to you I skull cull you Mamma.'' Al

will pronounce to be excessively foolish, trivial, paddling, and ultra-sent-
mental. es; I can see Jones at this minute (rather flushed with his point
of mutton and half-pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scoring under
the words `` foolish, paddling,'' &c., and adding to them his own remark
of `` quite true'' Well, he is a lofty ma of genius, and admires the great
nd heroic in life and novels; and so and better take warning and go
elsewhere.
Well, then. The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, and bonnet-
boxes of Miss Sedley having been arranged by Mr. Sambo in the carriage,
together with a very small and weather-beaten old cow's-skin trunk
with Miss Sharp's card neatly filed upon it, which was delivered by
mbo with a grin, and picked by the cochrane with a corresponding
sneer-tho hour for parting come; and the grief of that moment was
considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton
addressed to her pupil. Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to
philosophies, or that it named her in any way with a calmness, the result
of argument; but it was intolerable dull, porous, and tedious; and
having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss Sedley
did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions of private
grief. A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawing-
room, as on the solemn occasions of the visit of parents, and these refresh-
ments being partaken of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to depart.
 You 'll go in and say good by to Miss Pinkerton, Becky '' said Miss
Jemima to a young lady of whom nobody took any notice, and who was
coming down stairs with her own handbook.
 I suppose I must,'' said Miss Sharp calmly, and much to the wonder
of Miss Jemima; and the latter having knocked at the door, and receiving
permission to come in, Miss Sharp advanced in a very unconcerned man-
ner, and said in French, and with a perfect accent, ``Mademoiselle, je views
vous faire mes adieux.''
 Miss Pinkerton did not understand French; she only lireetel those
who did: but biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and Roman-
used head, (on the to of which figured a large and solemn turban,) she
said, `` Miss Sharp, I wish to a good morning.'' As the llammersmitl
Semiramis spoke, she waved one hand both by way of adieu, and to give
Miss Honor an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the land which
was left out for that purpose.
Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile and bow,
and quite declined to accept the proffered honour; on which Semirmis
tossed up ler turban more indignantly than ever. In fact, it was a little
battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter was worsted.
Heaven bless you, my child,'' said she, embracing Amelia, and scowling
the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp. ` Come away, Becky,''
said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great alarm, and the
drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.
Then came the struggle and parting below. Words refuse to tell it.
All the servants were there in the hall-all the car friends-all the young
ladies-the dancing-master who had just arrived; and there was such a
scuffling, and hugging, and kissing, and crying, with the hysterical years

Miss Sedley was almost as flurries at the act of defiance as Miss Jemima
had been; for, consider, it was but one minute that she had left school,
and the impressions of six years are not got over in that space of time.
Nay, with some persons those ages and terrors of youth last for ever and
ever. I know, for instance, an old gentleman of sixty-eight, who said
to me one morning at breakfast, will a very fitted countennce,  I
dreamed last night that I was flogged by Dr. ine.'' Funny had carried
him back five and fifty years in the course of that evening. Dr. Raine and

had been at thirteen. If the Doctor, with a large birch, had appeared
bodily to him, even at the age of threescore and eight, and had said in
awful voice, ` Boy, take down your pants Well, well, Miss
Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination.

 Why, do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back
to the black-hole '' said Rebecca, laughing.
 No : but--''

I may never set eyes on it again. I wish it were in the bottom of the

in the lower schoolroom, and to talk French to the Misses, until I grew
sick of my mother-tongue. But that talking French to Miss pinkerton
was capital fun, wasn't it She doesn't know a word of French, and was
too proud to confess it. I believe it was that which made her part with
one; and so thunk Heaven for French. ie la France 1 ioe l'empereur l
ise Bonaparte''
O Rebecca, Rebecn, for shame'' cried Miss Seley ; for this was
the greatest blasphemy Rebecca had as yet uttered; and in those days, in
England, to say ``Long live Bonaparte I'' was as much as to say ``Long
live Lucifer1''  IIow can you-how sure you have such wicked,
vengeful thoughts''
` Revenge may be wicked, but it 's natural,'' answered Miss rebecca.
 I 'm no angel.'' And, to say the truth, she certainly was not.
For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which
took place as the conch rolled long lazily by the river side) that though
Miss Rebecca Sharp has twice had occasion to thank Heaven, it has been,
in the first place, for ridding her of some person whom she hated, and
secondly, for enabling her to bring her enemies to some sort of perplexity
or confusion ; neither of which are very amiable motives for religious
gratitude, or such as would be put forward by persons of a kind and
place disposition. Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the least kind or
playable. All the world used her ill, said this young misanthropist (or
nisogynuist, for of the world of men she can be pronounced as yet to have
had but little experience), and we may be pretty certain that the persons
of either sex whom all the world treats ill, deserve entirely the treatment
they get. The world is a looking-glass, and gives bulk to every man the
reflection of his own face. fRom at it, and it will in turn look sourly
pon you: luangh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion ; and
so let all young persons take their choice. This is certain, that if the
world neglected Miss Sharp, she never was known to have done a good
action in behalf of anybody; nor can it be expected that twenty-four
young ladies should all be as amiable as the heroine of this work, Miss Selley
(what we have selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured
of all, otherwise what on earth was to have prevented us from putting up
Miss Swartz, or Miss Crump, or Miss Hopkins, as heroine in her place?)
it could not be expected that every one should be of the humble and gentle
temper of Miss Amelia Sedley; should take every opportunity to vanquish
rebecca's hard-headedness and ill-humour; and, by a thousand kind words
and offices, overcome, for once at least, her hostility to her kind.
Miss Sharp's father was an artist, and in that quality had given lessons
of drawing at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man; a pleasant
companion; a careless student; with a great propensity for running into
debt, and a partiality for the tavern. When he was drunk, he used to
eat his wife and daughter; and the next morning, with a headache, he
used to oil at the world For its neglect of his genius, and abuse, with a
good deal of cleverness, and sometimes with perfect reason, the fools, his
brother painters. As it was with the utmost difficulty that he could keep
himself, and as he owed money for a mile round Soho, where he lived, he

thought to better his circumstances by marrying a young woman of the
French nation, who was by profession an opera-girl. The humble calling
of her female parent, Miss Sharp never alluded to, but used to state subset-
bluntly that the Entrechats were a noble family of Gascony, and took
great pride in her descent from them. And curious it is, that as she
advanced in life this young lady's ancestors increased in rank and
splendour.
Rebecca's mother had had some education somewhere, and her daughter
spoke French with purity and a Parisian accent. It was in those days
rather a rare accomplishment, and led to her engagement with the orthodox
Miss Pinkerton. For her mother being dead, her father, finding him-
self not likely to recover, after his third attack of delirium streets, wrote
a manly and pathetic letter to Miss Pinkerton, recommending the orphan
child to her protection, and so descended to the grave, after two bailiffs
had quarrelled over his corpse. Rebecca was seventeen when she came to
Chiswick, and was bound over as an article pupil; her duties being to
talk French, as we have seen, and her privileges to live cost free, and,
with a few guineas a year, to gather scraps of knowledge from the professors
who attended the school.
She was small and slight in person; pale, sandy-hired, and with eyes
habitually cast down: when they looked up they were very large, odd, and
attractive; so attractive, that the Reverend Mr. Crisp, fresh from Oxford,
and curate to the Vicar of Chiswick, the Reverend M. Flowerdew, fell in
love with Miss Sharp; being shot dead by a glance of her eyes which was
fired all the way across Chiswiek Church from the school-pew to the
reading-desk. This infatuated young man used sometimes to take tes
with MIss Pinkerton, to whom he had been presented by his mamma, and
actually proposed something like marriage in an intercepted note, which
the one-eyed applewoman was charged to deliver. Mrs. Crisp was sum-
money from Buxton, and abruptly carried off her darling boy; but the
idea, even, of such an eagle in the Chiswick dovecot caused a great flutter
in the breast of Miss Pinkerton, who would have sent away Miss Sharp, but
that she was bound to her under a forfeit, and who never could thoroughly
believe the young lady's protestations that she had never exchanged a single
word with Mr, Crisp, except under her own eyes on the two occasions
when she had met him at tea.
By the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the establishment,
Rebecca Sharp looked like a child. But she had the dismal precocity of
poverty. Many a dun had she talked to, and turned away from her father's
door; many a tradesman had she conxed and wheeled into good-humour,
and into the granting of one meal more. She sate commonly with her
father, who was very proud of her wit, and heard the talk of many of his
wild companions-often but ill suited for a girl to hear. But she never
had been a girl, she said; she had been a woman since she was eight years
old. O why did Miss Pinkerton let such a dangerous bird into her cage
The fact is, the old lady thought Rebecca to be the weakest creature in
the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought her to
Chiswick, used Rebecca to perform the part of the ingenae. She thought
her n modest and innocent little child; and only a year before the arrange-

ment by which Rebecca had been admitted into her house, and when Rebecca
was sixteen years old, Miss Pinkerton majestically, and with little speech,
made her a present of a doll-which was, by the way, the confiscated pro-
party of iss Swindle, discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school-
hours. How the father and daughter laughed ass they trudged home
together after the evening party, (it was on the occasion of the speeches,
when all the professors were invited,)and how Miss Pinkerton would have

managed to make out of her doll She used to go through dialogues

to ask Referee if Miss Pinkerton was at home: she was well known to

honour to pass a few days at Chiswick; after which she brought bak

he catastrophe come, and she was brought to the Mall as to her home.
The rigid formality of the place suffocated her: the prayers and the meals,
the lessons and the walls, which were arranged with a convention reg-
clarity, oppressed her almost beyond endurance: and she looked back to
the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in Soho with so much
regret, that everybody, herself included, fancied she ws consumed with
grief for her father. She had a little room in the garret, where the maids
heard her walking and sobbing at night; but it was with rage, and not
with grief. She had not been much of a dissembler, until now her lonely-
ness taught her to feign. She had never mingled in the society of women:
her father, reprobate as he was, was a man of talent ; his conversation
was a thousand times more agreeable to her than the talk of such of her
own sex as she now encountered. The pompous vanity of the old school-
mistress, the foolish good-humour of her sister, the silly chat and scandal
of the elder girls, and the frigid correctness of the goverucsses equally
annoyed her; and she had no soft maternal heart, this unlucky girl, other-
wise the rattle and talk of the younger children, with whose care she was
chiefly entrusted, might have soothed and interested her; but she lived
among them two years, and not one was sorry that she went away. he
gentle tender-hearted Amelia Sedley was the only person to whom she could
attach herself in the least ; and who could help attaching herself to Amelia?
The happiness-the superior advantages of the young women round
about her, grave rebecca inexpressible pangs of envy.  What airs that
girl gives herself, because she is in Earl's granddaughter,'' she sunid of one.
How they cringe and bow to that Creole, because of her hundred
thousand pounds I am a thousand times clever and more charming
than that creature, for all her wealth. I am as well bred as the Earl's
granddaughter, for all her fine pedigree; and yet every one passes me by
here. And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their
gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?'' She
determined at any rate to get free from the prison in which she found
herself, and now began to act for herself, and for the first time to make
connected plans for the future.
She took advantage, therefore, of the means of study the place offered
her; and as she was already a musician and a good linguist, she spceedily
went through the little course of study which was considered necessary for
ladies in those days. TIer music she practised incessantly, and one day,
when the girls were out, and she had remained at home, she was over-
heard to play a piece so well, that Minerva thought wisely, she could
spare herself the expense of a master for the juniors, and intimated to
Miss Sharp that she was to instruct them in music for the future.
The girl refused; and for the first time, and to the astonishment of the
majestic mistress of the school. `I am here to speak French with the
children,'' Rebecca said abruptly, ``not to teach the music, and save
money for you. Give mo money, and I will teach them.''
Minerva was obliged to yield, and, of course, disliked her from that day.
 For five-and-thirty years,'' she said, and with great justice, I never

have seen the individual who has dared in my own house to question my
authority. I have nourished a viper in my bosom.''
 A viper-a fiddlestick,'' said Miss Sharp to the old july, almost find-
dug with astonishment. ``You took me because I was useful. There is no
question of gratitude between us. I hate this place, and want to leave it,
I will do nothing here, but what I am obliged to do.''
It was in vain that the old lady asked her if she was aware she was
speaking to Miss Pinkerton rebecca laughed in her face, with n torrid
sarcastic demoniacal laughter, that almost sent the schoolmistress into fits.
Give me a sum of money,'' said the girl, ``and get rid of me-or, if you
like better, get me a good place as governess in a nobleman's family-you
can do so if you please.'' And in their further disputes she always
returned to this point, ` Gct me a situation-we hate each other, and I
m ready to go.''
Worthy Miss Pinkerton, although she had a Ronan nose and a turban,
and was as tall as a grenadier, and had been up to this time an irresistible
princess, had no will or strength like that of her little apprentice, and in
vain did battle against her, and tried to overawe her. Attempting once
to sold her in public, Rebecca hit upon the before-mentioned plan of
answering her in French, which quite routed the old woman. In order to
maintain authority in her school, it became necessary to remove this rebel,
this monster, this serpent, this firebrand; and hearing about this time
that Sir Pitt Crowley's fully was in want of a governess, she actually
recommended Miss Sharp for the situation, firebrand and serpent as she
was. ''I cannot, certainly,'' she said, ''find fault with Miss Ship's con-
duct, except to myself; and must allow that her talents and accom-
punishment are of a high order. As for and the head goes, at least, she
does credit to the educational system pursue at y establishment.''
And so the schoolmistress reconciled the recommendation to her on-
science, and the indentures were cancelled, and the apprentice was free.
The battle here described in a few lines, of course, lasted for some months.
And as MIss Selley, being now seventeen years of age, was about to lcavc
school, and had a friendship for Miss Sharp, (`` 'is the only point in
Amelia's behaviour,'' said Minerva, '`which has not been satisfactory to
her mistress,'') Miss Sharp was invited by her friend to pass a week with
her at home, before she entered upon her duties as governess in a private
Family.
Thus the world began for these two young ladies. For Amelia it was
quite a new, fresh, brilliant world, with all the bloom upon it. It was not
quite a new one for Rebecca-(indeed, if the truth must be told with
respect to the Crisp affair, the tart-woman hinted to somebody who took
nn affidavit of the fact to somebody else, that there was a great deal more
than was made public regarding Mr. Crisp unl Miss Sharp, and that his
letter was in danger to another letter). But who can tell you the rcnl truth
of the matter At all events, if becca was not beginning the world,
she was beginning it over again.
By the time the young ladies reached Kensington turnpike, Amelia had
not forgotten her companions, but had driel her tears, and hud bushel

spied her as he was riding by, and said, ``A dem fine gl, gall'' and
before the carriage arrived in Russell Square, a great deal of conversation
has taken place about the drawing-room, and whether or not young ladies
wore powder as well as hoops when presented, and whether she was to
have that honour: to the Lord Mayor's ball she knew she was to go.
And when at length home was reached, Miss Amelia Sedley skipped out on
Sambo's arm, as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole big city
of London. Both he and coaching agreed on this point, and so did her
father and mother, and so did every one of the servants in the house, as
they stood bobbing, and curteeying, and smiling, in the hall, to welcome
their young mistress.
You may be sure that she showed Rebecca oer every room of the
house, and everything in every one of her drawers ; and her books, and
her piano, and her dresses, and all her necklaces, brooches, laces, and
gimcracks. She insisted upon Rebecca accepting the white carnelian and
the turquoise rings, and a sweet spirited muslin, which was too small for
her now, though it would fit her friend to a nicety; and she determined
in her heart to ask her mother's permission to present her white Cashmerc
shawl to her friend. Could she not spare it? and had not her brother
Joseph just brought her two from India?
When Rebecca saw the two magnificent Cashmere shawls which Joseph
Sedley had brought,home to his sister, she said, with perfect truth, ``that
it must be delightful to have a brother,'' and easily got the city of the
tender-hearted Amelia, for being alone in the world, an orphan without
friends or kindred.
:Not alone,'' said Amelia, ``' you know, Rebecca, I shall always be your
friend, and love you as a sister-indeed I will.''
`'Ah, but to have parents, as you have-kind, rich, affectionate parents,
who give you everything you ask for; and their love, which is more pre-
pious than all1 My poor papa could give me nothing, and I had but twa

Perhaps she had mentioned the fact already to rebecca, but that young

lady did not appear to have remembered it; indeed, vowed and protested
that she expected to see a number of Antlia's nephews and nieces. She
was quite disappointed that Mr. Sedley was not married; she was sure
Amelia had said he was, and she doted so on little children.
I think you must have had enough of them at Chiswick,'' sail Amelia,
rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friend's part; and indeed
in later days Miss Sharp would never have committed herself so far as to
advance opinions, the untruth of which would have been so easily detected.
But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet, unused to the art
of deceiving, poor innocent creature and making her own experience in
her own person. The meaning of the above series of queries, as trans-
later in the heart of this ingenious young woman, was simply this:-`If
Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why should I not marry him
I have only a fortnight, to be sure, but there is noharmintrying.'' And she
determined within herself to make this laudnble attempt. She redonbled
her caresses to Amelia; she kissed the white cornelia necklace as she put
it on; and owed she would never, never port with it. When the dinner-
bell rang she went down stairs with her arm around her friend's waist, as
is the habit of young ladies. She was so agitated at the drawing-room
door, that she could hardly find courage to enter. ` Feel my heart, how
it beats, dear1'' nid she to her friend.
 No, it doesn't,'' said Amelia. `' Come i, don't be frightened. Papa
wont do you any harm.,''

hid his entire face almost in his neekcloths at this apparition.
It's only your sister, Joseph,'' sait Amelia, laughing and shaking the
two fingers which he held out. :I 've come hoe fr good you know;
and this is my friend, Miss Sharp, whom you have heard me mention,.''
No, neer, upon my work,'' said the head under the neckcloth, shak-
ing very much,-`` that is, yes,-what nominally cold weather, Miss;''-
and herewith he fell to poking the fire with all his might, although it was
in the middle of June.
 He's very handsome,'' whispered Rebecca to Amelia, rather loud.
 Do you think so:'' said the latter,  I 'lL tell lim.''
Drying l not for worlds,'' sail Miss Sharp, starting back us timid
as a fun. She had previously made a respectful virgin-like curtsey tao
the gentleman, and her modest eyes gazed so perseveringly on the carpet
that it was a wonder how she should have found an opportunity to see him.
 Thank you for the beautiful shawls, brother,'' said Amelia to the fire-
poker. ``Are they not beautiful, Reserve ?''
O heavenly'' said Miss Sharp, and her eyes went from the carpet
straight to the chandelier.
joseph still continued a huge flattering at the power and tongs, puffing
and blowing the while, and turning as red as his yellow face would allow
him. I can't mkc you such handsome presents, Joseph,'' continued his
sister, ``but while I was at school, I have considered for you a very
beautiful pair of braces,''
 Good And l Amelia,'' erie the brother, in serious alarm, `` what do
you mean?'' and plunging with all his might at the ball-rope, that article
of furniture came away in his hand, and increased the honest follow's con-
fusion.  For heaven's sake sce if my buggy 's at the door. I can't wait.
I must go. D- that groom of mine. I must go.''
At this minute te father of the family walked in, rattling lis seals like
a true British merchant.  What's the matter, Month '' says he.

in his way.
Joseph nt this burst out into a wild fit of laughter; in which, encounter-
ing thc eye of MIss Sleep, he stopped all of a sudden, as if he had been shot.

you. Have you nul emmy been quarrelling already with Joseph, that he
wants to be off ''
`I promise Botany, of our service, sir,''soil Joseph, ``to dine with him.''
O fe1 didn't you tell your mother you would dine here''
But in this press it 's impossible.''
 Look at him, isn't he lnlsome enough to dine anywhere, Miss
Sharp?''
On which, of course, Miss Sharp looked at her friend, and they both set
off in a fit of laughter, highly agreeable to the old gentleman.
 Did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at Miss Pinkerton's''
continued he, following up his advantage.
 Gracious heavens Father,'' cried Joseph.
e There now, I have hurt his feelings. Mra. Selley, y dear, I have
hurt your son's feelings. I have alludes to his buckskins. Ask Miss
Sharp if I haven't Come, Joseph, be friends with Miss Sharp, and let
us all go to dinner.''
 There's a pillar, Joseph, just as you like it, and Papa has brought
home the best turlot in Billingsgate.''
 Come, come, sir, walk down stairs with Miss Sharp, and I will follow
with these two young women,'' sil the filer, and he took an arm of wife
nd daughter and walked merrily off.

MIss Sharp had no kind parent to arrange these delicate matters for her,

do her very best to secure the husband, who was even more necessary for
her than for her friend. She had a vivid imagination; she had, besides,
read the ``Arabian Nights'' and `` Guthrie's Geography,'' and it is a fact,
that while she was dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia
whether her brother was very rich, she had built for herself a most magna-
office castle in the air, of which she was mistress, with a husband some-
where in the background (she had not seen him as yet, and his figure
would not therefore be very distinct); she had arrayed herself in an infinity
of shawls, turbans, and diamond necklaces, and had mounted upon an
elephant to the sound of the march in Bluebeard, in order to pay a visit of
ceremony to the Grand Mogul. Charming Alnaschar visions l it is the
happy privilege of youth to construct you, and many a fanciful young
creature besides Rebecca Sharp, has indulged in these delightful any-dreams

Joseph Sedley was twelve years older than his sister Amelia. He was in
the East India Company's Civil service, and his name appeared, at the
period of which we write, in the Bengal division of the East India Register,
as collector of Boggley Wouldn, an honourable and lucrative post, as every-
body knows: in order to know to what higher posts Joseph rose in the
service, the reader is referred to the same periodical.
Boggley Wollah is situated in a fine, lonely, marshy, jungle district,
famous for suite-shooting, and where not infrequently you may flush a
tiger. Ramgunge, where there is a magistrate, is only forty miles off,
and there is a cavalry station about thirty miles farther; so Joseph wrote
home to his parents, when he took possession of his colleetorship. lIe
had lived for about eight years of his life, quite alone, at this charm-
aug place, scarcely seeing a Christian face, except twice a year, when the
detachment arrived to carry off the revenues which he had collected, to
Calcutta.
Luckily, at this time he caught a liver complaint, for the cure of which
he returned to Europe, and which was the source of great comfort
and amusement to him in his native country. He did not lie with his
family while in London, but had lodgings of his own, like a gay young
bachelor. Before he went to India he was too young to partake of the
delightful pleasures of a man about town, and plunged into them on his
return, with considerable assiduity. He drove his horses in the l'ark;
he dined nt tlc fashionable taverns, (for the Oriental Club was not as
yet invented); he frequented the theatres, as the mode was in those days,
or made his appearance at the opera, laboriously attired in tights and a
cocked hat.
On returning to India, and ever after, he used to talk of the pleasure of
this period of his existence with great enthusiasm, and give you to under-
stand that he and lBrummel were the leading bucks of the day. But he
was as lonely here as in his jungle at Boggley Wollah. lIe scarcely kue
n single soul in the metropolis: and were it not for his doctor, and the
society of his blue-pill, and his liver complaint, he must have died of lone-
lines. He was lazy, peevish, and a bon-vioant;: the appearance of a lady
frightened him beyond measure; hence it was but seldom that he joined
the paternal circle in Russell Square, where there was plenty of guilty, and

where the jokes of his good-natural old father frightened his amor-propre.
His bulk caused Joseph much anxious thought and alarm; now and then
he would make a desperate attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat;
but his insolence and love of good living speedily got the better of these
endeavours at reform, and he found himself again at his three meals a day.
lIe never was well dressed; but he took the highest pains to adorn his
big person, and passed many hours daily in tlt occupation. His valet
made a fortune out of his wardrobe : his toilet-table was covered with as
any pomatums and sciences as ever were employed by an old beauty:
he has tried, in order to give himself n west, very girth, stay, and wrist-
bund then invented. Like ost fat men, he woud have his clothes made
too tight, and took care they should be of the most brilliant colours
and youthful cut. When dressed at length, in the afternoon, he would
issue forth to take a drive with nobody in the park; and then would come
back in order to dress again and go and dine with nobody nt the Piazza
Coffee-House. lIe was as vain as a girl; and perhaps his extreme shyness
was one of the results of his extreme unity. If Miss Recent can get the
better of him, and at her first entrance into life, she is a young person of
no ordinary cleverness.
The first move showed considerable skill. Wen she called Scdley n
very handsome man, she knew that Amelia would tell her mother, who
would probably tell Joseph, or who, at any rate, would be pleased by tlc
compliment paid to her son. All mothers are. If you and told Unicorns
that her son Caliban was as handsome as Apollo, she would have been
pleased, witch as she was. Perhaps, too, Joseph Sedley would overhear
the compliment-Rebecca spoke loud enough-and he did her, and (think-
in in his heart that he was a very fine man,) the praise thrilled through
every fibre of his big body, and made it tingle with pleasure. Then, how-
ever, came a recoil. `` Is the girl making fun of me'' he thought, and
straight he bounced towards the hell, anne was for retreating, as we
have seen, when his father's jokes and his mother's entrenties caused him
to pause and stay where he was. Ie conducted the young lady down to
dinner in a dubious and agitated frame of ind. :Does she really think
I am handsome'' thought he, `` or is she only making game of me'' WE
have talked of Joseph Scley being as vain as a girl. Heaven help us the
girls have only to turn the tables, and say of one of their own scx, ' She is
as vain as a man,'' s they will have perfect reason. The bearded crca-
tubes are quite as eager for praise, quite as fucking over their toilettes, quite
as proud of their personal advantages, quite as conscious of their powers of
fascination, as any couette in the world.
Down stirs, then, they went, Joseph very real and blunshing, Rebecca
very modest, and holding her green eyes downwards. She was dressed
in white, with bare shoulders ns white and snow-the picture of youth,
unprotected innocence, and humble virgin simplicity. ` I must be very
quiet,'' thought Rebeee, `` and very much interested about India.''
Now we have heard how Mrs. Sedley hud prepared n fine curry for her
son, just as he liked it, and in the course of dinner a portion of this dish
was offered to Rebecca. : What is it?'' sail she, turning an appealing
look to Mr. Joseph.

he paternal laugh was echoed by Joseph, who thought the joke capital.
The ladies only filed a little. hey thought poor greece suffered tou
such. She would have liked to choke old Sedley, but she swallowed her
mortilication as well as she had the abominable curry before it, and as
soon as she could speak, said, with a comical, good-humoured air-
``I ought to have remembered the pepper which the Princess of Persia
puts in the cream-tarts in the Arabian Nights. Do you put cayce
into your cream-tarts in India, sir%''
Old Sclley began to laugh, and thought Rebecca was a good-humoured
girl. Joseph simply sail- Cream-tarts, Miss:? Our crem is very and

tale many scores of times to his apothecary, r. Gallop, when he came to
inquire about the liver and the blue-pill.
Being an invalid, Joseph Sedley contented himself with a bottle of claret
besides his Madeira at dinner, and he managed a couple of plates full of
strawberries and cream, and twenty-four little rout cues, that were lying
neglected in a plate near him, and certainly (for novelists have the privilege
of knowing everything), he thought a great deal about the girl up stairs.

oon Joe's panie lasted for to or three
days; during which he did not visit
the louse, nor during that period did
Miss Rebecca ever mention his name.
She was all respectful gratitude to
Mrs. Sedley; delighted beyond mea-
sure nt the bazaars; and in a whirl of
wonder at the theatre, whither the
good-natured lady took her. Onc
day, Amelia had a head-ache, and
could not go upon some party of
pleasure to which the two young
people were invited: nothing could
induce her friend to go without her.
 Whntl you who have shown the
poor orphan what happiness and love are for the first time in her life-
quit you' never.'' and the green eyes looked up to Icven and filled
with tears ; and Mrs. Seley could not but own that her daughter's friend
had a charming kind heart of her own.
As for Mr. Sedley's jokes, Rebecca lugled at them with a cordialiy
und perseverance which not a little pleased aud softened that good-natured
gentleman. Nor was it with the chiefs of the family alone that Miss
Sharp found favour. She interested Mrs. Blenkinsop by clicking the
deepest sympathy in the raspberry-jam preserving, which operation was
then going on in the HOusekeeper's room ; she persisted in calling Sama
 Sir,'' and ` Mr. Snmbo,'' to the delight of that attendant; and she
apologised to the lady's maid for giving her trouble in venturing to ring
the bell, with such sweetness and humility, that the Servants' Hall is
almost as charmed with her as the Drawing Room.
Once, in looking over some drawings which Amelia and sent from
school, rebecca suddenly cme upon one which caused her to burst into
tears and leave the room. It was on the day when Joe Scdley made his
second appearance.
Amelia hastened after her friend to know the cause of this display of
feeling, and the good-natural girl came back without her companion,
rather affected too.  You know, her father was our drawing-master.
Mamma, at Chiswick, and used to do all the best parts of our drawings,''

` 1 'm better, now,'' said the girl, with the sweetest smile possible,
taking good-natured Mrs, Sedley's extended hand and kissing it respect-
fully.  How kind you all are to me. All,'' sle added, with a laugh,
``except you, Mr. Joseph.''

per-dish at dinner, the first day I ever saw you you are not so good to
me as dear Amelia,''

 Perhaps there was not enough citron juice in it;-no, there was not.''
 And the chili P 
I3y Jove, how they made you cry out.'' said Joe, caught by the ride-
rule of the circumstance, and exploding in a fit of laughter which ended
quite suddenly, as usual.
I shall take care how I let you choose for me another time,'' said
Rebecca, as they went down again to dinner. `I didn't think men were
fond of putting poor harmless girls to pain.''
BY Gad, Miss Rebecca, l1 wouldn't hurt you for the world.''
 No,'' said she, `` I owe you wouldn't;'' and then she gave him over
so gentle a pressure with her little hand, and drew it back quite frightened,
and looked first for one instant in his face, and then down at the carpet-
rods; and I am not prepared to say that Joe's heart did not thump at
this little involuntary, timid, gentle motion of regard on the part of the
simple girl.
It was an advance, and as such, perhaps, some ladies of indisputable
correctness and gentility will condemn the action as immodest; but, you
see, poor dear rebecca had all this work to do for herself, If a person
is too poor to keep a servant, though ever so elegant, he must sweep his own
rooms : if a dear girl has no dear Manmma to settle matters with the young
man, she must do it for herself. And oh, what a mercy it is that these
women do not exercise their powers oftener1 We can't resist them, if
they do. Let them slow ever so little inclination, and men go down on
their knees at one: old or ugly, it is all the same. And this I set down

absolute hump, may marry who snE LIEs. Only let us be thankful
that the darlings are like the beasts of the field, and don't know their own
power. They would overcome us entirely if they did.
`Egan :'' thought Joseph, entering the dining-room, '`I exactly begin
to feel as I did at Medium with Miss Cutler.'' Many sweet little appeals,
half tender, alf joeular, did Miss Sharp make to him about the dishes at
dinner; for by this time she was on a footing of considerable familiarity
with the family, and as for the girls, they loved each other like sisters.
oung unmarried girls always do, if tlc arc in a house together for ten
days.
As if bent upon dancing Rebecca's plans in every way-what must
Amelia do, but remind her brother of a promise made last lister holidays
-When I was a girl at school,'' said she, laughing--a promise that he,
Joseph, would take her to Vauxhall.  Now,'' he said, `` the Rebecca
is with us, will be the very time.''
O, delightful 1'' said Rebecca, going to clap her hands; but she re-
collected herself, and paused, like a modest creature, as she was.

' and that a woman of your years and size is to count cold, in such an

``Let Joe go,'' sil his father, laughing.  He's in enough.'' A1
which speech even Mr. Sambo at the sideboard burst out laughing, and
good fat Joe felt inclined to become a barricade almost.
 Unto his stays l'' continued the pitiless old gentleman.  Fling some
water in his face, Miss Sharp, or carry him up stairs : the dear creature's

If he stand this, Sir, I 'm d-1'' roared Joseph.
Order Mr. Jos's elephant, Sambo1'' cruel the father. `Send to
Exeter 'Change, Sambo;'' but seeing Jos realy almost to cry with vera-
tion, the old joker stopped his laughter, and sail, holding out his hand to
his son, ` It's all fair on the Stock-Exchange, Jos,-and, Sambo, never
find the elephant, but give me and Mr. Jos a glass of Champagne. Boney
himself hasn't got such in his cellar, my boy1''
A goblet of Champagne restored Joseph's equanimity, and before the
bottle was emptied, of which as an invalid he took two-thirds, he had
green to take the young ladies to Vauxhall.
The girls must have a gentleman apiece,'' said the old gentleman.
'`Jos will be sure to leave EMmy in the crowd, he will be so taken up with
Miss Sharp here. Send to 86, and ask George Osborne if he'll come.'
At this, I don't know in the last for walt reason, Mrs. Sedlcy looked
at her husband and laughed. Mr. Sedley's eyes twiukled in a manner
indescribably roguish, and he looked at Amelia,; and Amelia hanging
down her head, brushed as only young ladies of seventeen know how to
lush, and as Miss rebecca Sharp never brushed in her life-at least not

since she was eight years old, and when she was caught stealing jam one

her father; `` and let George Osborne see what n beautiful hand-writing

That was years ago,'' said Amelia.
It seems like yesterday, don't it, John?'' soil Mrs. Sedley to her his-
band; and that night in a conversation which took place in a front room
in the second-floor, in a sort of tent, hung round with chintz of a rich and
fantastic India pattern, and double' with cnlico of a tender rose-colour; in
the interior of which species of marquee was a feather-bed, on which were
two pillows, on which were two round red faces, one in a laced nightcap, and
one in n iimle cotton one, ending in a tassel :-in a curtain lecture, I
sny, MIrs. Sedley took her husband to task for his cruel conduct to poor
Joc.
It was quite wicked of you, Mr. Sedley,'' said she, ``to torment tlc
poor boy so.''
My denr,'' said the cotton-tasscel in defence of his conduct, `' Jos is
a great deal rainer than you ever were in your life, and that 's saying u
good deal. Though, some thirty years ago, in the year seventeen hundred

say no. But I 've no patience with Jos nnl his dnndifiel modesty. It is

of himself, and what a fine fellow he is. I doubt, Ma'am, wc shall have

with great energy.
e Why not she as well as another, Mrs. ScdleyP The girl's a white
face at any rate. IT don't care who marries him. Lct Joe please
himself.''
And presently the voices of the two speakers were hushed, or were
replaced by the gentle but romantic music of the nose; and save when
the church bells tolled the hour and the watchman called it, all was silent
at the house of John Sculley, Esquire, of russell Square, and the Stock
Exchange.
When morning came, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley no longer thought
of executing her threats with regard to Miss Shop; for though nothing
is more keen, nor more common, nor more justifiable, than maternal
jealousy, yet she could not bring herself to suppose that the little, humble,
grateful, gentle governess, would dare to look up to such a magnificent
ersonage as the Collector of Boggley Wollah. The petition, to, for an
extension of the young lady's leave of absence had already been despatched,
and it would be difficult to find a pretext for abruptly dismissing her.

VANITY PAIR.
And as if all things conspired in four of the gentle Rebecca, the very
clements (although she was not inclined at first to acknowledge their
action in her behalf) interposed to aid her. For on the evening appointed
for the auxhall party, George Osborne having come to dinner, and the
elders of the house having departed, according to invitation, to dine with
Alderman Balls, at Higlbury Barn, there came on such a thunder-storm
as only happens on Vauxhall nights, and as obliged the young people,
performed, to remain at home. Mr. Osborne did not seem in the last is-
appointed at this occurrence. Ho and Joseph Sedley drank a fitting

of which Sedley told a number of is best Indian stories ; for he was ex-
extremely talkative in man's society ;-and afterwards Miss Amelia Sedley
did the honours of the drawing-room; and these four young persons
passed such a comfortable evening together, that they declared they were
rather goal of the thunder-storm than otherwise, which had caused them
to put off their visit to Vauxhall.
Osborne was Sedley's godson, and had been one of the family any time
these three-and-twenty years. At six weeks old, he had received from
John Sedley a present of a silver cup; at six months old, a coral with
gold whistle and bells; from his youth, upwards, hs was ``tied'' reg-
early by the old gentleman at Christmas: and on going back to school,
he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by Joseph edley, when the
latter was a big, staggering, hobbadyhoy, and George an impudent urchin
of ten years old. In a word, George was as familiar with the family s
such daily acts of kindness and intercourse could make him.

the tassel of your Hessian boots, and how Miss-hem l-how Amelia
rescued me from a betting, by falling down on her knees and crying out
to her brother Jos, not to bent little George P''
Jos remembered this remarkable circumstance perfectly well, but vowed
that he had totally forgotten it.
 Well, do you remember coming own in a gig to Dr. Swishtail's, to
see mc, before you went to India, and giving me half a guinea and a it
on the head I always had an idea that you were at least seven feet
high, and was quite astonished at your return from India to find you no
taller than myself.''
lOw good of Mr. Sedley to go to your school nnl give you the
money 1'' exclaimed Rebecca, in accents of extreme delight,
 es, and after I had cut the tassel of his boots too. Boys never
forget the tips at school, nor the givers.''
I delight in Hessian boots,'' said Rebecca. Jos Selley, who admired
his own legs prodigiously, aud always work his ornamental saussure, was
extremely pleased at this remark, though he drew his legs under his chair
as it was made.

'I shan't have time to do it here,'' said rebecca.  I 'll do it when-
when I am god.'' And she dropped her voice, and looked so sad and
pirates, that everybody felt how cruel her lot was, and how sorry they
would be to part with her.
O that you could stay longer, car Rebecca,'' said Amelia.
 Why ?'' answered the other, still more sadly. `` That I may be only
the more unep-unwilling to lose you'' And she turned away her
heel. Amelia began to give way to that natural infirmity of tears which,
we have said, was one of the defects of this silly little thing. George
Osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity; and
Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a high out of his big chest, as he
cast his eyes down towards his favourite Hessian boots.
Let us have some music, Miss Sedley-Amelia,'' sail George, who
felt at that moment an extraordinary, almost irresistible impulse to seize
the above-mentioned young woman in his arms, and to kiss her in the free
of the company; and she looked at him for a moment, and if I should say
that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time, I should
perhaps be telling an untruth, for the fact is, that these two young people
had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose, and their banks
had, as it were, being read in their respective families any time these ten
years. They went off to the piano, which was situated, as pianos usually
are, in the back drawing-room; and as it was rather lark, Miss Amelia, in
the most unaffected way in the world, put her hand into Mr. Osborne's,
who, of course, could see the way among the chris and ottomans a great
deal better than she could. But this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley
teite-d-tete ith Rebecca, at the drawing-room table, where the latter was
occupied in getting a green silk purse.
 There is no need to ask family secrets,'' said Miss Sharp.  Those
two have told theirs,''
As soon as he gets his company,'' said Joseph, ``I believe the affair is
settled. George Osborne is as good a fellow as ever breathe.''
``And your sister te dearest creature in the world,'' said Rebecca.
`Happy the man who wins her' With this, Miss Sharp gue a great
sigh.
When two unmarried persons get together, and talk upon such delicate
subjects as the present, a great deal of confidence and intimacy is presently
established between them. here is no need of giving a special report of
the conversation which now took place between Mr. Sclc and the young
lady; for the conversation, as many bce judged from the foregoing specimen,
was not especially witty or content; it seldom is in private societies, or
anywhere except in very high-flown and ingenious novels. As there was
music in the next room, the talk was carried on, of course, in a low and
becoming tone, though, for the matter of that, the couple in the next apart-
ment would not have been disturbed had the talking been ever so loud, so
occupied were they with their own pursuits.
most for the first time in his life, Mr. Selley found himself talking,
without the least timidity or hesitation, to n person of the other sex. MIss

VANITY FAIR.
Ielccca asked him a great number of questions about India, which gave
him an opportunity of narrating many interesting anecdotes about that
country and himself. HE described the balls at Government House, and
the manner in which they kept themselves cool in the lot weather, with
punks, tactics, and other contrivances; and he was very witty regarding
the number of Scotchen whom Lord Into, the Governor-General,
patronised; and then he described a tiger hunt ; and the manner in which
the mahout of his elephant had been pulled off his seat by one of the
infuriated animals. IIow delighted Miss quebec was at the Government
balls, and how she laughed at the stories of the sCotch aides-de-camp, and
called Mr. Sedley a sad wicked satirical creature; and how frightened she
was at the story of the elephant. For your mother's sake, dear Mr.
Sedley,'' she said, ` for the sake of all your friends, promise never to go on
one of those horrid expeditions,''
 Pooh, pool, Miss Sharp,'' said he, pulling up his shirt-collars; `` thc
danger makes the sport only the pleasant.'' He had never been but one
at a tiger-hunt, when the accident in question occurred, and when he was
half killed-not by the tiger, but by the fright. And as he talked on, le
grew quite bol, and actually had the audacity to ask Miss Rebecca for
whom she was knitting the green silk purse? He was quite surprised and
delighted at his own graceful familiar manner.
For any one who wants a purse,'' replied Miss Rebecca, looking at
him in the most gentle winning way. Sedley was going to make one of
the most eloquent speeches possible, and has begun, `TO Miss Sharp,
how-'' when soe song which was performed in the other room came to
an end, and caused him to hear his own voice so distinctly that he stopped,
flushed, and blew his nose in great agitation.
Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence P'' whispered
Mr. Osborne to Amelia. : Why, your friend has worked miracles.''
 The more the better,'' said Miss Maclin; who, like almost all women
who are worth a pin, was a match-maker in her heart, and would have been
delighted that Joseph should carry back a wife to India. She had, too, in
the course of this few days' constant intercourse, warmed into a most
tender friendship for Rebecca, and discovered a million of virtues and
amiable qualities in her which she had not perceived when they were at
Chiswick together. or the affection of young ladies is of a rapid growth
as Jack's bean-stalk, and reaches up to the sky in night. It is no blame
to them that after marriage this Sehxueuelt nach der Lille subsides. It is
what sentientalists, who deal in very big words, cull a yearning after the
Ideal, and simply means that women are commonly not satisfied until they
have husbands and children on whom they may centre affections, which
are spent elsewhere, as it were, in small change.
Having expended her little store of songs, or having stayed long enough
in the back drawing-room, it now appeared proper to Miss Amelia to ask
her friend to sing. ` You would not have listened to me,'' she said to
Mr. Osborne, (though she knew she was telling a fbi,) ``had you heard
rebecca first,''
I gic Miss Sharp warning, though,'' said Osborne, `' that, right or
wrong, I consider Miss Amelia Sedley the first singer in the world.''

You shall her,'' sid Amelia; md Joseph Sedley was actually polite
enough to carry the candles to the piano. Osborne hinted that he should
like quite as well to sit in the dark; but Miss Sedley, laughing, declined
to bear him company any farther, and the two accordingly followed Mr.
Joseph. Rebecca sng far better than her friend, (though of course
Osborne was free to keep his opinion,) and exerted herself to the utmost,
and, indeed, to the wonder of Amelia, who had never known her perform
so well. She sang a French song, which Joseph did not understand in the
last, and which George confessed he did not understand, and then a
number of those simple ballads which were the fashion forty years ago,
and in which British tars, our King, poor san, blue-eyed Mary, and the
like, were the principal themes. They are not, it is said, very brilliant, is
a musical point of view, but contain numberless good-natured, simple
appeals to the affections, which people understood better than the ill-

Conversation of a sentimental sort, befitting the subject, was carried on

the seams of which his great big bones were bursting-as the representative
of so many pounds of ten, candles, sugar, mottlel-soup, plums, (of which a
very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the establishment), and
other commodities. A dreadful by it was for young Dobbin when one of

young waves, usher and all, who rightly considered that the selling of goods
by retail is a shameful and infamous practice, meeting the contempt and
scorn of all real gentlemen.
``Your father's only a merchant, Osborne,'' Dobbin said in private to
the little boy who had brought down the storm upon him. At which
the utter replied haughtily, ` My father's a gentleman, and keeps his
carriage;'' and Mr. William Dobbin retreated to an remote outhouse in
the play-ground, where he passed a half-holiday in the bitterest sadness

you degrade, estrange, torture, for the sake of a little loose arithmetic, and
miserable dog-latin
Now, William Dobbin, from an incapacity to acquire the rudiments of
the above language, as they are propounded in that wonderful book the
Eton Latin Grammar, was compelled to remain among the very last of
Doctor Swishtail's scholars, and was `taken down' continually by little
fellows with pink faces and pinafores when he marched up with the lower
form, a giant amongst them, with his dowucast, stupefiedlook, his dogs-eared
primer, and his tight corduroys. lEigh and low, all made fun of him.
Tley sewed up those corduroys, tight as they were. They cut his bed-
strings. They upset buckets and benches, so that he might break his
shins over them, which he never failed to do. Tley sent him parcels,
which, when opened, were found to contain the paternal soap and candles.
There was no little fellow but had his acer and joke at Dobbin; and he
bore everything quite patiently, and was entirely dumb and miserable.
Cuff, on the contrary, was the great chief and dandy of the Swishtail
Seminary. He smuggled wine in. He fought the town-boys. Ponies
used to come for him to ride home on Saturdays. He had his top-boots
in his room, in which he used to hunt in the holidays. He had a gold
repeater : and took cuff like the Doctor. He had been to the Opera,
and knew the merits of the principal actors, preferring Mr. Keen to Mr.
kemble. He could knock you off forty Latin verses in an hour. He would
make French poetry. What else didn't he know, or couldn't he do They
said even the Doctor himself was afraid of him.
Cuff, the unquestioned king of the school, ruled over his subjects, and
bullied them, with splendid superiority. This one blacked his shoes: that
toasted his bread, others would fag out, and give him all at cricket
during whole summer afternoons. ` Figs' was the fellow whom he despised
most, and with whom, though always abusing him, and sneering at him,
he scarcely ever condescended to hold personal communication.
One day in private, the two young gentlemen had had a difference. Figs,
alone in the school-room, was blundering over a home latter; when Cuff,
entering, bade him go upon some message, of which tarts were probably
the subject.
 I can't,'' says Dohbin; ``I want to finish my letter.''
 You can't 2'' says Mr, Cuff, laying hold of that document, (in which
many words were scratched out, many were mis-spelt, on which had been
spent I don't know how much thought, and labour, and tears; for the poor
fellow was writing to his mother, who was fond of him, although she was
a grocer's wife, and lived in a back parlor in hames-street), `` you can't2'
says Mr. Cuf:  ` I should like to know why, pray Cnn't you write to

 Well, now will you go'' says the other.

No, I won't. Don't strike, or Ill last you,'' roars out Dobbin,
springing to s leiden instead, and looking so wicked, that Mr. Cuf
paused, turned down his coat sleeves again, put his hands into his pockets,
and walked away with a sneer. But he never meddled personally wirth the
grower's boy after that: though we must do him the justice to say he also
spoke of Mr. Dobhin with contempt behind his back.
some time after this interview, it happened that Mr. Cuff, on a sun-
shiny afternoon, was in the neighbourhood of poor William Dobbin, who
was lying under a tree in the play-ground, spelling over a favourite copy
of the Arabian Nights which he had-apart from the rest of the school,

If people would but leave children to themselves; if teachers would
cease to bully them; if parents would not insist upon directing their
thoughts, and dominating their feelings-those feelings and thoughts

Well, William Dobbin had for one forgotten the world, and was away

recalled and the Fairy Periban in that delightful cavern where the
Prince found her, and whether we should all like to make a tour; when
slrill cries, as of a little fellow weeping, woke up his pleasant reverie;
and, looking up, he saw Cuff before lim, belahouring a little boy.
It was the lad who had reached upon him about the grocer's part; but
he bore little malice, not at least towards the young and small.  How
dare you, sir, break the bottle2'' says Cuff to the little urchin, swinging
a yellow cricket-stump over him.
The boy had been instructed to get over the play-ground wall (at n
selected spot where the broken-glass had been removed from the top, and
niches mate convenient in the brick); to run a quarter of a mile; to purchase
n pint of rum-shub on credit; to brave all the Doctor's outlying spies,
and to clamber back into the play-ground again; during the performance
of which feat, his foot had slept, and the bottle was broken, and the shrub
had been spilt, and his pantaloons had been damaged, and he appeared
before his employer a perfectly guilty and trembling, though harmless,
wretch.
How dare you, sir, break it'' says Cuff; `' you blundering little thief.
You drank the shrub, and now you pretend to have broken the bottle.
1Sold out your hand, sir.''
Down came the stump with a great heavy thump on the chill's hand.
A onn followed. Dobbin looked up. Tho Prince Peribanou had fled
into the inmost cavern with Prince Ahmed: the Roc and whisked away
Sinbad the Sailor out of the Valley of Diamonds out of sight, far into the
clouds: and there was every-day life before honest William; and a big boy
beating a little one without cause.
 Hold out your other hand, sir,'' roars Cuf to his little school-fellow,
whose face was distorted with ain. Dobbin quivered, and gathered him-
self up in his narrow old clothes.

I can't tell what his motive was. Torture in a public school is as much
licensed as the knout in Russia. It would be ungentlemanlike (ina
manner) to resist it. Perhaps Dobbin's foolish soul revolted against that
exercise of tyranny; or perhaps he had a wandering feeling of revenge in
his mind, and longer to measure himself against that splendid bully and
tyrant, who had all the glory, pride, pomp, circumstance, banners flying,
drums beating, guards saluting, in the place. WHatever may have been
his incentive, however, up he sprang, and screamed out, ``IIold off, Cuff;
don't bully that child any more; or I'll-''
 Or you'll, what'' Cuff asked in amazement at this interruption.

ee I 'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life,'' Dobbin
said, in reply to the first part of Cuff's sentence; and little Osborne,
gasping and in tears, looked up with wonder and ineredulity nt seeing this
amazing champion put up suddenly to defend him : while Cuff's nstonish-
ment was scarcely less. Fancy our late monarch George III, when he
heard of the revolt of the North American colonies: fancy brien Goliath
when little David stepped forward and claimed a meeting; and you have
the feelings of Mr. Reginald Cuff when this encounter was proposed to him.
 After school,'' says he, of course; after a pause and a look, as much as
to say, `Make your will, and communicate your best wishes to your friends
between this time and that'
'As you please,'' Dobbin said.  You must be my bottle-holder,
Osborne.''
Well, if you like,'' little Osborne replied; for you see his ppa ket n
carriage, and he was rather based of his champion.
Yes, when the hour of battle came, he was almost ashamed to say,'' Go
it, Figs ;'' and not a single other boy in the place uttered that cry for the
first two or three rounds of this famous combat; at the commencement of
which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on his fiuce, and as
light and as gay as if he was at a ball, planted his blows upon his adler-
say, and floored that unlucky champion three times running. At each
fall there was a cheer ; and everybody was anxious to have the honour of
offering the conqueror a knee.
What a licking I shall get when it's over,'' young Osborne thought.
picking up his man. : You'd best give in,'' he said to Dobbin; '' it's only
n thrashing, Figs, and you know I'm used to it.'' But Figs, nll whose
limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage, put his
little bottle-holler aside, and went in for a fourth time.
As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed at
himself, and Cuff lad begun the attack on the three preceding decisions,
without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now determined that he
would commence the engagement by a charge on his own part; and accord-
singly, being a left-handed man, brought that arm into action, and hit out
a couple of times with all his might-once at Mr. Cuff's left eye, and once
on his beautiful Roman nose.
Cuff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly.  W1
hit, by Jove,'' says little Osborne, with the air of n connoisseur, lapping
his man on the back. : Gie it him with the left, Figs, my boy,''
Figs's left made terrific play during all the rest of the county. Cff
went down every time. At the sixth round, there were almost as many
fellows shouting out, `` Go it, Figs,'' as there were youths exeluiming, '' Go
it, Cu.'' At the twelfth round the latter champion was all abronl, as the
saying is, and had lost all presence of mind and power of attack or defence.
Figs, on the contrary, was as calm as a quaker. His face being quite pale,
his eyes shining open, and a great cut on his under lip bleeding profusely,
gave this young fellow a fierce and ghastly air, which perhaps struck terror
into many spectators. Nevertheless, his intrepid adversary prepared to
close for the thirteenth time.

I I had the pen of a Napier, or n.Bell's Life, I should like to describe
this combat properly. It was the last charge of the Guard-(that is, it
would have been, only Waterloo had not yet taken place)-it was Ney's
column creating the will of IN Haye Sainte, bristling with ten thousand
bayonets, and crowned with twenty cables-it was the short of the beef-
eating British, as leaping down the hill they rushed to hug the enemy in
the savage arms of battle-in other words, Cuff coming up full of pluck,
but quite reeling and groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on
his adversary's nose, and sent him down for the last time.
I think that will do for him,'' Figs sail, as his opponent dropped as
neatly on the green as I have seen Jack Spot's ball plump into the pocket
at billiards; an the fact is, when time was called, Mr. reginald Cuff was
not able, or did not choose, to stand up again.
And now all the boys set up such a short for Figs as would make you
think he had been their darling champion through the whole battle; and
as absolutely brought Dr. Swishtail out of his study, curious to know the
cause of the uproar. He threatened to flog Figs violently, of course;
but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing his
wounds, stood up and said, `` It's my fault, sir-not Figs'-not Dobbin's.
I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.'' By which magna-
imous speech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping, but got back
ll lis ascendancy over the boys which his defeat had nearly cost him.
Young Osborne wrote home to his parents an account of the transaction.

In consequence of Dobbin's victory, his character roe prodigiously in
the estimation of all his schoolfellows, and the name of Figs which had
been a byword of reproach became as respectable and popular a nickname
as any other in use in the school. ``After all, it's not his fault that his

there got a fair place for lim. It was discovered, that although lull at
classical learning, at mathematics he was uneommonly quick. To the
contentment of all, he passed third in algebra, and got a French prize-book
at the public midsummer examination. on should have seen his mother's
face when Telemaque (that delicious romance) was presented to him by the
Doctor in the face of the whole school and the parents and company, with an
inscription to Guglielmo Dobbin. All the boys clapped hands in token
of applause and sympathy. IIis bushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness,
and the number of feet which he rushed as he went back to his place,
who shall describe or calculate?' Old Dobbin, his father, who no
respected him for the first time, gave him two guineas publicly; most of
which he spent in a general tuck-out for the school: and he came back in
a tail-coat after the holidays.
Dobbin was much too modest a young fellow to suppose that this
happy change in all his circumstances arose from his own generous and
manly disposition: he chose, rom some perverseness, to attribute his good
fortune to the sole agency and benevolence of little George Osborne, to
whom henceforth he vowed such a love and affection as is only felt by
children-such n affection, ns we read in the charming fairy-book,
uncouth Orson had for splendid young Valentine his conqueror. He
flung himself down at little Osborne's feet, and loved him. Even
before they were acquainted, he had admired Osborne in secret. Now he
was his valet, his dog, his man Friday. He believed Osborne to be the
possessor of every perfection, to be the handsomest, the bravest, the most
active, the cleverest, the most generous of created boys. He shared his
money with him: bought him uncountable presents of knives, pencil-cases,
gold seals, toffee, Little Warblcrs, and romantic books, with large coloured
pictures of knights and robbers, in many of which latter you might read
inscriptions to George Medley Osborne, Esquire, from his attached friend
WIlliam Dobbin-the which tokens of homage George received very
graciously, as became his superior merit.
So that when Lieutenant Osborne, coming to Russell square on the
day of the Vauxhall party, said to the ladies, ``Mrs. Sedley, Ma'am, I
hope you have room ; I 've asked Dobbhin of ours to come and dine here,
and go with us to Vauxhall. He's almost as modest as Jos.''
``Modestly pooh,'' said the stout gentleman, casting a easier look
at Miss harp.
:He is-but you are incomparably more graceful, Belly,'' Osborne
added, laughing. 'I met him at the Bedford, when I went to look for
you; and I told him that Miss Amelia was come home, and that we were
all bent on going out for a night's pleasuring; and that Mrs. Sedley had

yellow fever three times; twice at Nassau, and once at St. Kitts.''
 Well, well; yours is quite yellow enough for us. Isn't it, Emmy''
Mrs. Sedley said: at which speech Miss Amelia only male a smile and a
blush; and looking at Mr. George Osborne's pale interesting countenance,
and those beautiful black, curling, shining whiskers, which the young
gentleman himself regarded with no ordinary complacency, she thought in
her little here, that in His Majesty's army, or in the wide world, there
never was such a face of such a hero. I don't care about Captain
Dobbin's complexion,'' she said, ``or about his awkwardness. I shall
always like him, I know;'' her little reason being, that he was the friend
and champion of George.
 There 's not a finer fellow in the service,'' Osborne said, ``nor n bet-
ter officer, though he is not an Adonis, certainly.'' And he looked towards
the glass himself with much naivete',: and in so doing, caught Miss Sharp's
eye fixed keenly upon him, at which he brushed a little, and Rebecca
thought in her heart, ' l, mon eau Monsieur ' I think I have your guge'
-the little artful minxl
That evening, when Amelia came tripping into the drawing-room in a
white muslin frock, prepared for conquest at Vauxhall, singing like n
lnrk, and as fresh as a rose-a very tall unfairly gentleman, with large
hands and feet, and large ears, set off by a closely cropped head of black
hair, nnl in the hideous military frogged coat and .cocked-hit of those
times, advanced to meet her, and made her one of the clumsiest bows that
was ever performed by a mortal.
This is no other than Captain William Dobbin, of His Majesty's-
Regiment of Foot, returned from yellow fever, in the West Indies, to
which the fortune of the service had ordered his regiment, whilst so many
of his gallant comrades were reaping glory in the Peninsula.
He had arrived with a knock so very timid and quiet, that it was iau-
diblc to the ladies upstairs : otherwise, you may be sure Miss Amelia would
never have been so hold as to come singing into the room. As it was, the
sweet fresh little voice went right into the Captain's heart, and nestled
there. When she held out her hand for him to slake, before he eve-
loved it in his own, he paused, and thought- Well, is it possible-are

His history since he left school, until the very moment when we have
the pleasure of meeting him again, although not fully narrated, has yet, I
think, been indicated sufficiently for an ingenious reader by the converse-
tion in the last page. Dobbin, the despised grover, was Alderman Dobbin-
Alderman Dobbin was Colonel of the City Light Horse, then burning with
military armour to resist the French Invasion. Colonel Dobbin's corps,
in which old Mr. Osborne himself was but an indifferent corporal, had
been reviewed by the Sovereign and the Duke of work; and the colonel
and alderman had been knighted. His son had entered the army: and
young Osborne followed presently in the same regiment. They had served
in the West Indies and in Canada. Their regiment had just come home,
and the attachment of Dohbin to George Osborne was as warm and
generous now, as it had been, when the two were schoolboys.
So these worthy people sat down to dinner presently. They talked
about war and glory, and Money and Lord Wellington, and the last
Gazette. In those famous days every gazette had a victory in it, and the

to gallant young men longed to see their own names in the glorious list,
and cursed their unlucky fate to belong to a regiment which had been away
from the chances of honour: Miss Sharp kindled with this exciting talk,
but Miss Sedley trembled and grew quite faint as she heard it. Mr. Jos
told several of his tiger-hunting stories, finished the one about Miss Cut-
ler and Lance the surgeon: helped Rebecca to everything on the table,
and himself gobbled and drank a great deal.
He sprang to open the door for the ladies, when they retired, with the
most killing grace-and coming back to the table, filled himself bumper
after bumper of claret, which he swallowed with nervous rapidity.
He's priming himself,'' Osborne whispered to Dobbin, and at length
the hour and the carriage arrived for Vauxhall.

Thus you see, ladies, low this story might have been written, in the

Newgate as with the palaces of our revered aristocracy, and has seen the
outside of both. But as I don't understand the language or manners of

able novelists, is spoken by the leaders of ton; we must, if you please,

with which we are most familiar. In a word, this chapter about Vanxhall
would have been so exceeding short but for the above little disquisition, that
it scarcely would have deserved to be called a chapter at all. And yet it is
an chapter, and a very important one too. Are not there little chapters in
everybody's life, that seem to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the
history ?
Let us then step into the coach with the RUssell-square party, and be
off to the Gardens. There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp,
who are on the front sent. Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite, between
Captain Dobbin and Amelia.
Very soul in the coach agreed, that on that night, Jos would.propose to
make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley. The parents at home had acquiesced
in the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a feeling
very much akin to contempt for his son. He said he was vain, selfish,
lazy, and effeminate. He could not endure his airs as a man of fashion,
and laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories. `'I shall leave
the fellow half my property,'' he said; ``and he will have, besides, plenty
of his own; but as I am perfectly sure that if you, and I, and his sister
were to be to-morrow he would say `Good Gall' and eat his dinner just
as well as usual, I am not going to make myself anxious about him. Let
im mary whom he likes. It's no affair of mine.''
Amelia, on the other hand, as became a young woman of her prudence
and temperament, was quite enthusiastic for the match. Once or twice.
Jos had been on the point of saying something very important to her, to
which she was not willing to lend an year, but the fat fellow could not be
brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his
sister's disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned
away.
This mystery served to keep Amelia's gentle bosom in a perpetual flutter
of excitement. If she did not speak with Rebecca on the tender subject,
she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations with Mrs.
Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, who dropped some hints to the lady's-maid,
who may have cursorily mentioned it to the cook, who carried the news, I
have no doubt, to all the tradesmen, so that Mr. Jos's marriage was now
talked off by a very considerable number of persons in the Russell-square
world.
It was, of course, Mrs. Selley's opinion that her son would demean
himself by a marriage with an artist's daughter. But, lor', Mn'am,''
cjaculated Mrs, Blenkinsop, `` we was only grocers when we marriedMIr.
., who was a stock-broker's clerk, and we hadn't fie hundred pounds
among us, and we're rich enough now,'' And Amelia was entirely of this
opinion, to which, gradually, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley was brought.
Mr. Selley was neutral. ``Let Jos marry whom he likes,'' he said;
it's no affair of mine. This girl has no fortune; no more hal Mrs.
Sedley. She seems good-humoured and clever, and will keep him in order,
perhaps. Better she, y dear, than a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of
mahogany grandchildren.''
So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebecca's fortunes. She took
Jos's arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sate by him
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous `bulk'' he was, as
he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though nobody snida
word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to understand it.
All she wanted was the proposal, and nhl how Rebecca now felt the
want of a mother s-a dear tender mother, who would have managed the
business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little delicate confidential
conversation, would have extracted the interesting vocal from the bash-
ful lips of the young nl
Such was the state of affairs as the carriage crossed Westminster-bridge.
The party was landed at the Royal Gardens in due time. As the
majestie Jos stepped out of the evening vehicle the crowd gave a cheer
for the fat gentleman, who flushed and looked very big and mighty, as he
walked away with Rebecca under his arm. George, of course, took charge
of Amelia. She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.
I say, Dohbin,'' says George, ``just look to the shnwls and things,
there 's a good fellow,'' And so while he paired off with Miss Sedley, and
Jos squeezed through the gate into the Gardens with Rebecca at his side,
honest Dobbin contented himself by giving an arm to the shawls, and by
paying at the door for the whole party.
He walked very modestly behind them. He was not willing to spoil
sport. About Rebecca and Jos he did not care a fig. But he thought
 Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Osborne, and as he saw that
good-looking couple, threading thc walks to the girl's delight and wonder,
he watched her artless happiness with a sort of further pleasure. Perhaps
he felt that he would have liked to have something on his own arm besides
na shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky young officer carrying this
female further); but William Dobbin was very little addicted to selfish
calculation at all; and so long as his friend was enjoying himself, how
should he be discontented And the truth is, that of all the delights of the
Gardens ; of the hundred thousand extra lamps, which were always lighted;
the fiddlers, in cooked hats, who played ravishing melodies under the gilded
cockle-shell in the midst of the gardens; the singers, both of comic and
sentimental ballads, who charmed the ears there; the country dances,
formed by bouncing cockney and cockneyesses, and executed amidst jump-
ing, thumping, and laughter; the signal which announced that Madame
Saqui was about to mount skyward on a slack-rope ascending to the stars;
the hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage; thc dark walks,
so favourable to the interviews of young lovers; the pots of stout handed
about by the people in the shabby old liverics; and the twinkling boxes,
in which the happy feasters made-believe to eat slices of almost invisible
ham ;-of all these things, and of the gentle Simpson, that kind smiling
idiot, who, I daresay, presided even then over the place-Captain William
goblin did not take the slightest notice.
He carried about Amelia's white cnshmere shawl, and having attended
under the gilt cockle shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of
Borodino, (a savage Cantata against the Corsican start, who had lately
met with his Russian reverses)-Mr. Dobbin tried to him it as he walked
away, and found he was humming-the tune which Amelia Sedley sang
on the stairs, as she came down to dinner.

VANITY AIR.
He burst out laughing at himself; for the truth is, he could sing no
better than an owl.
It is to be understood, as a matter of course, that our young people,
being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn promises to keep
together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards.
Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'was only to meet again at
supper-time, when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the
interval.
What were the adventures of Mr. Osborne and Miss Amelia That is
a secret. But be sure of this-they were perfectly happy, and correct in
their behaviour ; and as they had been in the habit of being together any-
time these fifteen years, their teite-a-trite offered no particular novelty.

in a solitary walk, in which there were not above five score more of couples
similarly straying, they both felt that the situation was extremely tender
and critical, and now or never was the moment, Miss Sharp thought, to
provoke that declaration which was trembling on the timid lips of Mr.
Sedley. They had previously been to the panorama of Moscow, where a
rude fellow, treading on Miss Sharp's foot, used her to fall back with a
little shriek into the arms of Mr, Sedley, and this little incident increased

the tenderness and confidence of that gentleman to such a degree, that he
told her several of his favourite Indian stories over again for, at least,
the sixth time.
 How I should like to see India1'' said Rebecca.
 SHould you '' said Joseph, with a most killing tenderness; anl was
no doubt about to follow up this artful interrogators by a question still
more tender (for he puffed and wanted a great deal, and ebece's hand,
which was placed near his heart, could count the feverish pulsations of
that organ), when, oh, provoking the bell rang for the fireworks, and,
a great scuffling and running taking place, these interesting lovers were
obliged to follow in the stream of people.
Contain Dobbin had some thoughts of joining the party at supper: as,
in truth, he found the Yauxhall segment not particularly lively-but he
paraded twice before the box where the now united couples were met, and
nobody took any notice of him. Covers were laid for four. The mated
pairs were rattling away quite happily, and Dobbin knew he was as clean
forgotten as if he had never existed in this world.
 I should only be de trop,'' said the Captain, looking at them rather
wistfully.  I'd best go and talk to the hermit,''-and so he strolled off
out of the sum of men, and noise, and clutter of the banquet, into the
dark walk, at the end of which lived that well-known pastebonrd Solitary.
It wasn't very good fun for Dobbin-and, indeed, to be alone at Vauxhall,
I have found, from my own experience, to be one of the most dismal
sports ever entered into by a bachelor.
The two couples were perfectly happy then in their box: where the
most delightful and intimate conversation took place. Jos was in his
glory, ordering about the waiters with great majesty. He made the salad;
and uncorked the Champagne; and carved the chickens; and ate and
drank the greater part of the refreshments on the tables. Finally, he
insisted upon having a bowl of rack punch; everybody had rack punch at
Vauxhall.  Waiter, rack punch.''
That bowl of rack punch was the cause of all this history. And why
not a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause Was not a bow1 of
prussic acid the cause of fair Rosamund's retiring from the world? Dna
not a bowl of wine the cause of the demise of Alexander the Great, or at
least, does not Dr,. Lempricre say so -so did this bowl of rock punch
influence the fates of all the principal characters in this ` Novel without a
Hero,'' which we are now relating. It influenced their life, although most
of them did not taste a drop of it.
The young ladies did not drink it; Osborne did not like it; and the
consequence was that Jos, that fat gourmand, drank up the whole con-
tents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking up the whole
contents of the bowl was, a liveliness which at first was astonishing, and
then became almost painful; for he talked and laughed so loud as to
bring scores of listeners round the box, much to the confusion of the
innocent party within it; and, volunteering to sing a song (which he did
in that maudlin high-key peculiar to gentlemen in an inebriated state), he
almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the musicians

applause.
'Brown, Fat unl'' said one; ' Manager, Daniel Lambert I1'' said
another;  What a figure for the tight-rope l'' exclaimed another way, to
the irrepressible alarm of the ladies, and the great anger of Mr. Osborne.
e For Heaven's sake, Jos, let us get up and go,'' cried that gentleman,
and the young women rose.
 Stop, my dearest didlle-idle-darling,'' shouted Jos, now as bold as
a lion, and clasping Miss Rebecca round the waist. Rebecca started, but
she could not get away her hand. The laughter outside redoubled. Jos
continued to drink, to make love, and to sing; and, winning and waving
his glass gracefully to his audience, challenged all or any to come in and
take a sliare of his pitch.

Oh, ignorant young creatures How little do you know the effect of
rank-punch What is the race in the punch, at night, to the rank in the
head of a morning? To this truth I can vouch as a man; there is no
headache in the world like that caused by Vauxhall punch. Through the
lapse of twenty years, i can remember the consequence of two glasses-
two wine-glasses -but two, upon the honour of a gentleman; and Joseph
Sedley, who had a liver complaint, had swallowed at least a quart of the
abominable mixture.
That next morning, which Rebecca thought was to dawn upon her
fortune, found Sedley grouping in agonies which the pen refuses to describe.

only drink with which unhappy gentlemen soothed the fever of their pre-

Osborne found the ex-collector of loggleywollah groaning on the sofa at
his lodgings. bubbin was already in the room, good-naturedly tending
his patient of the right wedlock. 'he two officers looking at the prostrate

gentlemen, with the utensils and gravity of an undertaker, could hardly
keep his countenance in order, as he looked at his unfortunate master.
Mr, Sedley was uncommon wild last night, sir,'' he whispered in
confidence to Osborne, as the latter mounted the stair.  He wanted to
fight the 'ackney-coaching, sir. The Casting was obliged to bring him
up stairs in his harms like a babb.'' A momentary smile flickered oer
Mr. bRush's features as he spoke; instantly, however, they relapsed into
their usual unfathomable calm, as he flung open the drawing-room door,
and announced  MIr. Hosbin.''

For thrashing him last night-didn't he, Robin? You hit out, sir,
like Molyncux. The watclunan says he never saw a fellow go down so
straight. Ask Dobbin.''
You did have a ronnl with the coaching,'' Captain Dobbin sail, ``and
showed plenty of fight too,''
`And that fellow with the white coat at Vnuslall. How Jos drove at
him. IIow the women screamed By Jove, sir, it did a heart good to
see you. I thought you civilians had no pluck; but I 'll never get in your
way when you are in your cups, Jos.''
I believe I 'm very terrible, when I 'm rouse,'' ejaeulated Jos from the
sofa, and made a primate so dreary and ludicrous, that the Captain's
politeness could restrain him no longer, and he and Osborne fire offa
ringing volley of laughter.
Osborne pursued his advantage tirelessly. Hc. thought Jos a milksop.
Ie hal been revolving in his mind the marriage-question pending between
Jos and Rebecca, and was not over-well pleased that a member of a family
into which he, George Osborne, of the -th, was going to marry, should
make a neialliance with little nobody-a little upstart governess. '` You
it, you poor old fellow '' said Osborne.  You terrible Wy, man,
you couldn't stand-you made cvseryboly laugh in the Gardens, though
you were crying yourself. You were maudlin, Jos. Don't you remember
singing a song ''
A what '' Jos asked.
`'A sentimental song, and calling Rosa, Rebeee, what'as her name,
Amelia's little friend-your dearest little, idle, darling?'' And this
ruthless young fellow, seizing hold of Dobbin's hand, acted over the scene,
to the horror of the original performer, and in spite of Dobbin's good-
natured entrenties to him to have mercy.
Why should I spare him P'' Osborne said to his friend's remonstrances,
when they quittel the invalid, leaving him under the hands of Doctor
Gallop.  What the deuce right has he to give himself his patronizing
airs, and make fools of us at VauxhnllP Who's this little school-girl that
is ogling and making love to him? Hung in, the family 's low enough
already, without her. A governess is all very well, but I'd rather have a
lady for my sister-in-law. I 'm a liberal man; but I've proper pride, and
know my own station: let her know hers. And I'll take down that
great hectoring Naboo, and prevent him from being made a greater fool
than he is. That's why I told him to look out, lest she brought an action
against him.''

he saw, at the Sedley Mansion, in two different stories, two heads on the
look-out.
The fact is, Miss Amelia, in the drawing-room balcony, was looking
very eagerly towards the opposite side of the Square, where Mr. Osborne
dwelt, on the watch for the lieutenant himself; and Miss Ship, from her
little bed-room on the second-floor, was in observation until Mr. Joseph's
great form should lace in sight.
 Sister anne is on the watch-tower,'' said he to Amelia, '` but there's
nobody coming;'' andlaughing and enjoying the joke hugely, he described
in the most ludicrous terms to Miss tSedley, the dismal condition of her
brother.
 I think it 's very cruel of you to laugh, George,'' she soil, looking
particularly unhappy; but George only laughed the more at her pirates
and discomfited men, persisted in thinking the joke a ost diverting one,
and when Miss Sharp came dow stairs, battered her with a great deal of
liveliness upon the effect of her chars on the fat civilian.
O Miss Sharp if you could but see him this morning,'' he said-
` morning in his flowered dressing-gow-writhing on his sofa; if you
could but have seen him rolling out his tongue to (iollop the npothecury.''
See whom %'' and Miss Sharp.
 WhomP O whom? Captain Dobbin, of course, to whom we were all
so attentive, by the way, last night.''
We were very unkind to him,'' Emmy said, bluskinug very much.
I--I quite forgot him.''
Of course you did,'' cruel Osborne, still on the laugh. One can't
be always thinking about Dobbin, you know, Amelia. Cau one, Miss
Sharp2''
` Except when he oversee the glass of wine at dinner,'' Miss Sharp soil,
with a haughty air and n toss of the head, ` I never gave the existence of
Captain Dobbin one single moment's consideration.''
 Very good, Miss Sharp, I'll tell him,'' Osborne sail; and as he spoke
Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred towards this
young officer, which he was quite unconscious of having inspired.  It
is to make fun of me, is he : ' thought ebeee. 1Is he linen laughing
about me to Joseph As he frightened him? Perhaps he won't come.''-
A film passed over her eyes, and her heart beat quite thick.
 You 're always joking,'' said sle, smiling as innocently as she could.
 Joke away, Mr. George; there's nobody to second me.'' Anl George
Osborne, as she walked away-and Amelia looked reprovingly at him-
felt some little manly compunction for having inflicted any unnecessary
kindness upon this helpless creature. 'My dearest Amelia,'' said he,
``you are too good-too kind. you don't know the world. I do. Aud
your little friend Miss Sharp must learn her station,''
Don't you think Jos will--''
 Upon my worl, my dear, I don't know. In may, or may not. I'm
not his master. I only know he is a very foolish vin fellow, and put my
ear little girl into  err pinal an world position last night. May
least dildle--lille-darling?'' He was off laughing again; and he did
it so dolly the Emmy hughes too.
YANIS AIR.
All that day Jos never came. But Amelia had no fear about this; for
the little schemer had actually sent away the page, Mr. Sambo's aide-de-
camp, to Mr. Joseph's lodgings, to ask for some book he had promised,
and how he was; and the reply through Jos's man, Mr. Brush, was, that
his master was ill in bed, and had just had the doctor with him. He must
come to-morrow, she thought, but she never had the courage to speak a
word on the subject to Rebecca; nor did that young oman herself allude
to it in any way during the whole evening after the night at Yauxhall.
The next day, however, as the two young ladies sate on the sofa,
pretending to work, or to write letters, or to read novels, Sambo came into
the room with his usual engaging grin, with a packet under his arm, and
a note on a tray. ` Note from Mr. Jos, Miss,'' says Sambo.

DEAR FAMILIAR,-I send you the Orphan of the Forest. I was too
ill to come yesterday. I leave town to-day for Cheltenham. Pray excuse
me, if you can, to the amiable Miss Sharp, for my conduct at Vauxhall,
and entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may have uttered when
excited by that fatal supper. As soon as I have recovered, for my health
is very much shaken, I shall go to Scotland for some months, and am

It was the death-warrant. All was over. Amelia did not dare to look
at REbecca's pale feel and burning eyes, but she drops the latter into her
friend's lap; and got up, and went upstairs to her room, and died her
little heart out.
Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, there sought her presently with congo-
nation; on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially, and relieve herself
a good deal. Don't take on, Miss.  I didn't like to sellout. But none
of us in the house have like her except at fust. I sor ler with my own
eyes reading your In's letters. Winner says she 's always about you
trinket-box and drawers, and everybody's drawers, and she's sure she's
put your white ribbing into her box.''
``I gave it her, I gave it her,'' Amelia said.
But this did not alter Mrs. Bleukinsop's opinion of Miss Sharp. I
don't trust them governesses, Dinner, she remarked to the maid. They
give themselves the hairs and hupstarts of ladies, and their wages is no
better than you for me.''
It now became clear to every soul in the house, except poor Amelia,
that Rebecca should take her departure, and high and low (always with
the one exception) agreed that that event should take place as speedily as
possible. Our good child ransacked nll her drawers, cupbourds, particles,
and gimcraek boxes-passed in review all her gowns, fichus, tags, bobbins,
laces, silk stockings, and fulfill-selecting this thing and that and the other,
to make a little help for Rebecca. And going to er Papa, that generous
bRitish merchant, who had promised to give her as many guineas as she
was years old-she begged the old gentleman to give the money to dear
Rebecca, who must want it, while she lacked for nothing.
She even made George Osborne contribute, and nothing loth (for he was
as free-handed a young fellow as any in the army), he went to Bond
Street, and bought the best hat and spencer that money could buy.
tHat's George's present to you, Rebecca, dear,'' sail Aelia, quite
proud of the sandbox conveying these gifts. e What a taste he has
There 's nobody like him.''
Nobody,'' Rebecca answered. `How thankful I nm to him.'' She
was thinking in her heart, ` It was George Osborne who prevented my
marriage.-And she loved George Osborne accordingly.
She made her preparations for departure with great equanimity; and
accepted all the kind little AMelia's presents, after just the proper degree
of hesitation and reluctance. She vowed eternal gratitude to Mrs. Sedley,
of course; but did not intrude herself upon that good lady too much, who
was embarrassed, and violently wishing to avoid ler. She kissel Mr.
Sicily's hand, when he presented her with the purse; and asked permit-
sion to consider him for the future as her kind, kind friend and protector.
Her behaviour was so affecting that he was going to write her a cheque
for twenty pounds more; but he restrained his feelings: thc carriage was
in failing to take him to dinner: so he tripped away with a ` God bless

Finally came the parting with Miss Amelia, over which picture I intend
to throw a veil. But after a scene in which one person was in earnest
and the other a perfect performer-after the tcnderest caresses, the most
pathetic tears, the smelling-bottle, and some of the very best feelings of
the heart, has been called into requisition-Rebecca and Amelia parted,

LONG the most respected of the
names beginning in C, which the
Court - Guide contained, in the
year 18-, was that of Crawley, Sir
Pitt, Bront, Great Gaunt Street,
and Queen's Crawley, GIants. This
honourable nae had figured con-
stanley also in the 'parliamentary
list for many years, in conjunction
with that of a number of other
worthy gentleman who sent in turns
for the borough.
It is related, with regard to the
borough of Queen's Crawley, tliat
ucen Elizabeth in one of her pro-
presses, stopping at Crawley to
breakfast, was so delighted with
some remarkably fine Hampshire
. beer which was then presented to
her by the Crawley of the day (
handsome gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg), that she forthwitl
erected Crawley into a borough to send two members to Parliament; and
the place, from the day of tlt illustrious visit, took the name of Gulen's
Crawley, which it holds up to the present moment. And though bUy the
lapse of time, and those mutations which ages produce in empires, cities,
and boroughs, queen's Crawley was no longer so populous a place as it
had been in queen Bess's time-nay, was come down to that condition of
borough which used to be denominated rotten-yet, ns Sir Pitt Crawley
would say with perfect justice in his elegant way, ``ROtten be landed-
it produces me a googl fifteen hundred a year.''
Sir Pitt Crawley (named after the great Commoner), was the son of
Walpole Crawley, first Baronet, of the Tape nl sling-Wax Office
in the reign of George II., when he was impeached for speculation, as
were a great number of other honest gentlemen of those days; and
Walpole Crawley was, as need scarcely be said, son of John Churchill
Crawley, named after the celebrated military commander of the reign of
queen anne. The family tree (which lungs up at Gulen's Crowley),

furthermore mentions Charles Stuart, afterwards called Barebones Craw-
ley, son of the Crawley of James the First's time; and finally, queen
Elizabeth's Crawley, who is represented as the foreground of the picture
in his forked beard and armour. Out of his waistcoat, as usual, grows a
tree, on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are in-
scribed. Close by the name of Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet (the subject
of the present memoir), arc written that of his brother, the Reverend
Bute Crawley (the great Commoner was in disgrace when the reverend
gentleman was born), reelor of Craleys-cum-family, and of various
other male and female members of the Crawley family.
Sir Pitt was first married to Gabriel, sixth daughter of Mungo Binkie,
LOrd Binkie, and cousin, in consequence of MIr. dundas. She brought
him two sons: Pitt, named not so much after his father as after the
heaven-born minister; and Rawdon Crawley, from the Prince of Wales's
friend, whom his Majesty George IY. forgot so completely. Many years
after her ldyship's demise, Sir Pitt joel to the altar Rosa, daughter of Mr.
G. Grafton of Sudbury, by whom he had two daughters, for whose
benefit MIss Rebecca Sharp was now engaged as governess. It will be
seen that the young lady was come into a family of very genteel con-
exions, and was about to me in a much more distinguished circle than
that humble one which she had just quieted in Russell Square.
She had received her orders to join her pupils, in a note which was
written upon an old envelope, and which contained the following words:-
Sir Pitt Crawley begs Miss Sharp and baggage may be lear on
Tuesday, as I leaf for nexen's Crawley to-morrow morning early.

rebecca hd neer seen n Bnronet, as far as she knew, and as soon as
she had taken leave of Amelia, and counted the guineas which good-
natured Mr, Sedley had put into a purse for her, and as soon as she had done
wiping her eyes with her handkerchief (which operation she concluded the
very moment the carriage had turned the corner of the street), she began
to depict in her own mind what a baronet must be. I wonder, does he
wear a star2'' thought she, ``or is it only lords that wear stars But
he will be very handsomely dressed in a court suit, with ruffles and his
hair a little powdered, like Mr. Wroughton at Covent Garden. I sup-
pose he will be awfully proud, and that I shall be treated most contempt-
would. Still I must bear my hard lot as well as i can-at least, I
shall be amongst gentlgolks, and not with vulgar city people:'' and she
fell to thinking of her Russell Square friends with that very same philo-
sophicnl bitterness with which, in a certain apologue, the fox is represented
as speaking of the grapes
Having passel through Gaunt Square into Grant Gaunt Street, the
carriage at length stopped at a tall gloomy house between two other tall
gloomy houses, each with a catchment over the middle drawing-room
window; as is the custom of houses in Great Gaunt Street, in which gloomy
locality death seems to reign perpetual. The shutters of the first floor
windows of Si Pitt's mansion were closed-those of the dining-room were
partially open, and the blinds neatly covered up in old newspapers.

John, the groom, who had driven the carriage alone, did not care to
descend to ring the ball; and so prayed a passing milk-boy to perform
that office for him. When the bell was rung, a head appeared between
the intestines of the dining-room shutters, and the door was opened by a
man in drab breaches and waiters, with a dirty old coat, a foul old neck-
cloth lashed round his bristly neck, a shining bald head, a leering red facc,
a pair of twinkling grey eyes, and a mouth perpetually on the grin.

coming away.

rolled itself up, and retired usually under the sidcbasl: the polls
have hi idea their faces behind old sheets of brown paper: the ceiling lamp
is muted up in a dismal sick of brown holland: the window-curtains have
disappeared under all sorts of shabby envelopes : the marble bust of Sir
Walpole Crawley is looking from its black corner at the bare bonds and
the oiled fire-irons, and the empty card-racks over the mantel-piece: the
cellaret has lurked away behind the carpet : the claims are turned up heads
and tails along the walls: and in the dark corner opposite the statue, is an
old-fashioned crabbel knife-box, locked and sitting on a dumb waiter.
Two kitchen chairs, and a round table, and an attenuated old poker and
tongs were, however, gathered round the fire-place, as was a saucepan over
a feeble sputtering fire. There was a bit of cheese and bread, and a tin
candlestick on the table, and a little black porter in a pint-pot.

The lady addressed as Mrs. Tinker, at this moment made her appear-
ance with a pipe and a paper of tobacco, for which she had been despatched
a minute before Miss Sharp's arrival; and she landed the articles over to
Sir Pitt, who had taken his seat by the fire.

There'' replied Mrs. Tinker, flingiag down the coin; ``it 's only

` A frthing a day is seven shillings a year,'' answered the M.P.;
``seven shillings as year is the interest of seen guineas. Take care of your
farthings, old Tinker, and your guineas will come quite nat'ral.''
 You may be sure it's Sir Pitt Crawley, young woman,'' said Mrs.
Ticker, usually; ``because he looks to his farthings. you'll know him
hetter afore long.''
'And like me none the worse, Miss Slip,'' said the old gentleman,
with an air almost of politeness.  I must be just before I'm generous,''

 Over, and never will : it's against a principle. Go and get another
chip from the kitchen, Tinker, if you want to sit down; and then we'll
have a bit of supper.''
Presently the baronet plunged a fork into the saucepan on the fire, and
withdrew from the pot a piece of tripe and un onion, which he divided into
pretty equal portions, and of which he prtook with Mrs. Tinker.  You
see, Miss Sharp, when I'm not here Tinker's on board wages: when
I'm in town she dines with the family. Hawl hawl I' glad Miss
Sharp's not hungry, ain't you, TinkP''  And they fell to upon their frugal
supper.
After supper Sir Pitt Crawley began to smoke his pipe; and when it
became quite dark, he lighted the rushlight in the tin candlestick, and pro-
during from an interminnble pocket a huge mass of powers, began reading
them, and putting them in order.
I'm here on law business, y dear, and that 's low it happens that I
shall have the pleasure of such a pretty travelling companion to-morrow.''
He's always ut law business,'' said Mrs. Tinker, taking up the pot of
porter.

 She was as bad as he,'' said Tinker. `` She took the law of every one of
her tradesmen; and turned away forty-eight footmen in four year.''
`` She was close-very close,'' said the baronet, simply; '' but she was s
arable women to me, and saved me a steward.''-And in this confidential
strain, and much to the amusement of the new-comer, the conversation
continued for n considerable time. Whatever Sir Pitt Crawley's qualities
might be, good or bad, he did not make the least disguise of them. He
talked of himself incessantly, sometimes in the coarsest and vulgarest
Hampshire accent; sometimes adopting the tone of a man of the world.
And so, with injunctions to Miss Sharp to be ready nt five in the morning,
he made her good night. : You 'll sleep with Tinker to-night,'' he said;
It's a big bed, and there's room for two. Ludy Crawley died in it.
Good night.''
Sir Pitt went off after this benediction, and the solemn Tinker, rushlight
in and, led the way up the great bleak stone stairs, past the great dreary
drawing-room doors, with the handles muffled up in paper, into the great
front bed-room, where LAdy Crawley had slept her last. The bed and
chamber ware so funcreal and gloomy, you might have fanceied, not only
that Lady Crawley died in the room, but that her ghost inhabited it.
rebecca sprang about the apartment, however, with the greatest liveliness,
and had seeped into the use wardrobe, and the closets, and the cupboards,

and tried the drawers which were locked, and examined the dreary pictures
and toilette appointments, while the old chairwoman was saying her prayers.

Miss,'' said the old woman.  There 's room for us and a half-dozen of
ghosts in it,'' says Rebecca. : Tell me all about Lady Crawley and Sir
Pitt Crawley, and everybody, my dear Mrs. Tinker.''
But old Tinker was not to be pumped by this little cross-questioner; and
signifying to her tlt bed was a place for sleeping, not conversation, set up
in her corner of the bed such a store as only the nose of innocence cnn
produce. Rebecca lay awake for a long, long time, thinking of the morrow,
and of the new world into which she was going, and of her chases ot
success there. The rushlight flickered in the basin. The mantel-piece
cast up a great black shadow, over half of a mouldy old sampler, which her
defunct ladyship had worked, no doubt, and over two little family pictures
of young lads, one in a college town, and the other in a red jacket like a
soldier. When she went to sleep, rebecca chose that one to dream about.
At four o'clock, on such a rosette summer's morning as even male
Great Gaunt Street look cheerful, the faithful Tinker, having weakened her
bedfellow, and bid her prepare for departure, unarmed and unbolted the
great hall door, (the clanging und clapping whereof startled the sleeping
echoes in the street), and taking her way into Oxford Street, summoned a
coach from a stand there. It is needless to particularize the number of
the vehicle, or to state that the driver was stationed thus early in th
neighbourhood of Swallow Street, in hopes that some young buck, reeling
homeward from the tavern, might need the aid of his vehicle, and pay him
with the generosity of intoxication.
It is likewise needless to say, that the driver, if he had any such hopes
s those above stated, was grossly disappointed; and that the worthy
Baronet whom he drove to the City did not give him one single penny
nore than is fare. It was in vain that Jehu appealed and stormed; that
he flung down Miss Sharp's bandboxes in the gutter at the 'Necks, and
swore he would take the law of his fare.
 You'd better not,'' said one of the ostlers; ` it's Sir Pitt Crawley,''
 So it is, Joe,'' cried the Baronet, approvingly; ``and I'd like to see
the man can do me,''
 So should i,'' said Joe, grinning usually, and mounting the baronet's
baggage on the roof of the conch.
 Keep the box for one, Leader,'' exclaims the Member of Parliament to
the coaching; who replied, ' Yes, Sir Pitt,'' with a touch of his hat, and
rage in his soul, (for he had promised the box to a young gentleman from
Cambridge, who would have given a crown to a certainty), and Miss Sharp
was accommodate with n baek seat inside the carriage, which may be said
to be carrying her into the wide world.
How the young man from Cambridge usually put his fie great fonts in
front ; but was reconciled when little MIss Sharp was made to quit the
carriage, and mount up beside him-when he covered her up in one of his
Benjamins, and became perfectly good-humoured-how the asthmatic
gentleman, the prim lady, who declared upon her sacred honour she had

PLATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.

(Free.-Pitt Crawley.)
MY DEEs, sWEETEST AMELIA,
 With what singled joy and sorrow do I take up the pen to write
to my dearest friends Of, what a change between to-day and yesterday
Now I am friendless and alone; yesterday I was at home, in the sweet
company of a sister, whom I shall ever ever cherish
``I will not tell you in what tears and sadness I passed the fatal night
in which IS separated from you. Iou went on Tuesday to joy and happy
ness, with your mother and your devoted young soldier by your side; and
I thought of you all night, dancing at the Perkins's, the prettiest, I am
sure, of all the young ladies at the Ball. Was brought by the groom in the
old carriage to Sir Pitt Crawley's town house, where, after John the groom

had behaved most rudely and violently to me (alas 'was safe to insult
poverty and misfortune :), I was given over to Sir P,'s care, and made to
pass the night in an old gloomy bed, and by the side of a horrid gloomy
old chairwoman, who keeps the house. I did not sleep one single wink
the whole night.
 Sir Pitt is not what we silly girls, when we used to real Cecilia at
Chiswick, imagined a baronet must have been. Anything, indeed, less
like Lord Orville cannot be imagined. Fancy an old, stumpy, short,
vulgar, and very dirty man, in old clothes and shabby old waiters, who
smokes a horrid pipe, and cooks his own horrid supper in a saucepan.
He speaks with a country accent, and swore a great deal at the old char-
woman, at the hackney watchman who drove us to the in where the coach
went for, and on which I made the journey outside for the greater part
of the day.
I was weakened at daybreak by the chairwoman, and having arrived at
the inn, was at first placed inside the coach. But, when we got to
a place called Leakington, where the rain began to fall very heavily-will
you believe it?-I was forced to come outside ; for Sir Pitt is a proprietor
of the coach, and as a passenger came at Sudbury, who wanted an inside
place, I was obliged to go outside in the rain, where, however, a young
gentleman from Cambridge College sheltered me very kindly in one of his
several great coats.
This gentleman and the guard seemed to know Sir Pitt cry well, and
laughed at him a great deal. They both agreed in calling him an old screen,
which means a very stingy, avaricious person. lle never gives any money
to any body, they said (and this meanness I hate); and the young gentle-
man made me remark that we drove very slow for the last two stages on
the road, because Sir Pitt was on the box, and because he is proprietor of
the horses for this part of the journey. But won't I flog 'em on to
Squashmore, when I take the ribbons ' said the young Cantab. `And
save 'em right, Master Jack,' said the guard. When I comprelended
the meaning of this phrase, and that Master Jack intended to drive the
rest of the way, and revenge himself on Sir Pitt's horses, of course
I laughed too.
`A carriage and four splendid horses, covered with armorial bearings,
however awaited us at Sudbury, four miles from queen's Crawley, and
we made our entrance to the baronet's park in state. There is a fine
avenue of a mile long leading to the house, and the woman at the lodge-
gute (over the pillars of which are a serpent and a move, the supporters of
the Crawley arms,) made us a number of counties as she flung open the
old iron carved doors, which are something like those at odious Chiswick.
 eTher 's an avenue,' said Sir Pitt, `mile long. There's six thousand
pound of timber in them there trees. Do you call that nothing' He
pronounces avenue-evenae, and nothing-think, so droll; and hc and
n Mr. Olson, his hind from Sudbury, into the carriage with him, and
they talked about distracting, and selling up, and draining and subtitling,
and a great deal about tenants and farming-much more than I could
understand. Sam Miles had been caught touching, and Peter Bailey had
gone to the workhouse at last. `Serve him right,' said Sir Peter;  ' him

and his fam'ly has been cheating me on to farm these hundred and fifty
years.' Some old tenant, I suppose, who could not pay his rent. Sir
Pitt might have said `he and his family,' to be sure; but rich bayonets do
not need to be careful about grammar, as poor goernessees must be.
`'`As we passed, I remarked a beautiful church-spire rising above soe old
elms in the park; and before them, in the midst of a law, and some
outhouses, an old red house with tall chimneys covered with ivy, and the
windows shining in the sun.`Is that your church, sir?' I said.
Yes, hang it,' (said Sir Pitt, only he used, dear, a null wicked
weird); ` how's But, HodsonP But 's a brother lute, my dear-my
brother the person. Buy and the Best I cull im, ha, lal'
`LIaison laughed too, and then looking more grave anl nodding his
head, said, `I'm afraid he's better, Sir Pitt. He was out on his poy
yesterday, looking at our corn.'
: Looking after his tithes, hang 'un (only he used the same wicked
word). Will branly and water never kill him he's as tough as old
whatdyecallum-old Methusalem.'
`'Mr. Hodson laughed again. `The young men is home from college.
They'e whipped John Seroggins till he's well nigh dead.'
Who my second keeper!' roared out Sir Pitt.
He was on the person's ground, sir,' replied Mr. Olson; and
Sir Pitt in as fury swore that if ever he caught 'em producing on his
ground, he'd transport 'em, by the lord he would. However, he said,
`1'he sold the presentation of the living, Hodgson ; one of that breed shall
get it I was'not;' and Mr. Hodson said he was quite right: and I have no
doubt from this that the two brothers are at variance-as brothers often
are, and sisters too. Don't you remember the two Miss cratchlcy's at
Chiswick, how they used always to tight and quarrel-and Mary of,
how she was always thumping Louisa'
 Presently, seeing two little boys gathering sticks in the wood, MIr.
Hodson jumped out of the carriage, at Sir Pitt's order, and rushed upon
them with his whip. Pitch into 'em Hodson,' roared the barnet:
`flog their little souls out, and bring 'em up to the house, the vagalonds;
I'll commit 'em as sure as my name's Pitt.' And presently we heard
Mr. Olson's whip lacking on the shoulders of the poor little blubber-
ing wretches, and Sir Pitt, seeing that the malefactors were in custody,
rove on to the hall.
` All the servants were ready to meet us, and

``Here, my dear, I was interrupted last night by a dreadful timing
at my door: and who do you think it was Sir Pitt Crawley in his
night-cap and dressing-gown, such a figure: As I blank away from
such a visitor, he came forward and seized my candle; `no candles after
eleven o'clock, Miss Becky,' said he. ' Go to bed in the dark yo pretty
little hussey (that is what he called me), and unless you wish me to come
for the candle every night, mind and be in bed at eleven.' ANd with this,
he and Mr. Horroecks the butler went off laughing. You may be sure
I shall not encourage any more of their visits. They let loose two immense
blood-hounds at night, which all last night were yelling and howling at

the moon. I call the dog Gorer,' said Sir Pitt,; `he's killed a man that
dog has, and is master of a bull, and the mother I used to call Flora;
but now I calls her Carrier, for she's too old to bite. Haw, haw t'
Before the house of queen's Crawley, which is an odious old-fashioned
red brick mansion, with tall chimneys and gables of the style of been
Bess, there is a terrace flanked by the family dove and serpent, and on
which the great hall door opens. And oh, my dear, the great hall I o
ure is as big and as glum as the great hall in the dear castle of Udolpho.
It has a large fire-place, in which we might put half Miss Pinkerton's
school, and the rate is big enough to roast an on at the very least.
Round the room hang i don't know how many generations of Crawleys,
some with beards and runs, some with huge wigs and toes turned out;
some dressed in long straight stays and goes that look as stiff as
towers, and some with long ringlets, and, oh my denrl scarcely any stays
at all. At one end of the all is the great staircase all in black oak, as
dismal as may be, and on either side are tall doors with stag's heads over
the, leading to the billiard-room and the library, and the great yellow
saloon and the morning-rooms. I think there are least twenty bed-rooms
on the first floor; one of them has the bed in which ucen Elizabeth
alert; and I have been taken by my new pupils though all these fin
apartments this morning. They are not rendered less gloomy, I promise
you, by having the shutters always shut; and there is scarce one of the
apartments, but when the light was let into it, I expected to see a ghost
in the room. We have a school-room on the second floor, with my bed-
room leading into it on one side, and that of the young ladies on the
other. Then there are, Mr. Pitt's partments-Mr. Crawley, he is called-
the oldest son, and Mr. Rawdon Crawley's rooms-he is an officer like
somebody, and away with his regiment. There is no want of room I
assure you. You might lodge all the people in Russell square in the
house, I think, and have space to spare.
bEHalf an hour after our arrival, the great dinner bell was rung, and I
ve down with my two pupils (they are very thin insignificant little
hits of ten and eight years old). I came down in your dear muslin
gown (about which that odious Mrs. Pioneer was so rude, because you
gave it me); for I am to be treated as one of the family, except on com-
many days, when the young ladies and I are to dine up-stairs.
 Well, the great dinner bell rang, and we all assembled in the little
drawing-room where my Lady Crawley sits. She is the second Lady Craw-
ley, and mother of the young ladies. She was an ironmonger's daughter,
and her marriage was thought a great match. She looks as if she had
been handsome once, and her eyes are always weeping for the loss of her
beauty. She is pale and meagre and high-shouldered; and has not a
word to say for herself, evidently. Her step-son, Mr. Crawley, was like-
wise in the room. He was in full dress, as pompous as an undertaker.
He is pale, thin, ugly, silent; he las thin legs, no chest, hay-coloured
whiskers, and straw-coloured hair. He is the very picture of his sainted
mother over the mantel-piece-Griselda of the noble house of Binkie.
 This is the new governess,' Mr. Crawley, said Lady Crawley, coming
forward and taking my hand; ` Miss Sharp.'
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
seO1' said Mr. Crawley, and pushed his head once forward and
began again to read a great pamphlet with which he was busy.
I hope you will be kind to my girl,' said Lady Crawley; 'with her
pink eyes always full of tears.'
lAw Ma, of course she will,' said the eldest: ` and I saw at a
glance that I need not be afraid of that woman.'
My Lady is served,' says the Butler, in black, in an immense white
shirt-frill, that looked as if it had been one of the Queen Elizabeth ruffs
depicted in the hall; and so taking Mr. Crawley's arm, she led the way to
the dining-room, whither I followed with my little pupils in each hand.

Sir Pitt was already in the room with a silver jug. He had just been
to the cellar, and was in full dress too; that is, he had taken his liters
off, and showed his little dump legs in black worsted stockings. The
side-board was covered with glistening old plate-old cups, both gold and
silver ; old solvers and cruel stands, like Rundell and Bridge's shop.
Everything on the table was in silver too, and two footmen, with red hair
and canary-coloured liveries, stood on either side of the side-board.
: Mr. Crawley said a long grade, and Sir Pitt suid amen, and the great
silver dish-covers were removed.
s What have we for dinner, Betsy ?' said the Burnet.
mUtton broth, I believe, Sir Pitt,' answered Lay Crawley.

vANITY FAIR.
Mfouton au nets,' added the Butler gravely, (pronounce, if you please,
moutongonasy); `and the soup is stage de norton a Necrosis. The
side dishes contain pommes de terre au naturel, and closer d l'eau.'
Mutton's mutton,' said the Baronet, ` and a devilish good thing.
WHat ship was it, Horroeks, and when did you kill'
:One of the black-faced Scotch, Sir Pitt: we killed on Thursday.'
 Who took any'
 Steel, of Sudbury, took the saddle and two lega, Sir Pitt; but he says
the last was too young and confounded woolly, Sir Pitt.'
wIll you take some postage 2 Miss ah-MIss Blunt,' said Mr. Really.
Capital Scotch broth, my dear,' said Sir Pitt, ` though they call it
by a French name.'
 I believe it is the custom, sir, in decent society,' said M. Crawley,
haughtily, `to call the dish as I have called it ;' and it was served to us
on silver soup-plates by the footmen in the canary coats, with the luton
au names. Then ` nle and water' were brought, and served to us
young ladies in wine-glasses. I am not a judge of all, but I can say with
a clear conscience I prefer water.
 While we were enjoying our repast, Sir Pitt took occasion to ask what
had become of the shoulders of the mutton ?
I believe they were eaten in the servants' hall,' said my lady, humbly.
They was, my lady,' said Horroeks, `and precious little else we get
there neither.'
:Sir pItt burst into a hoarse laugh, and continued his conversation with
Mr. Iorrocks. That there little black pig of the Kent sow's breed must
be uncommon fat no,'
 It 's not quite busting, Sir Pitt,' said the Butler with the gravest air,
at which Sir Pitt, and with him the young ladies, this time, began to laugh
violently.
Miss Crawley, Miss Rose Crawley,' soil MIr. Crawley, `your laughter
strikes me as being exceedingly out of place.'
e Never mind my Lord,' said the Baronet, `we'll try the worker on
Saturday. Kill 'un on Saturday morning, John Horrocks. Miss Sharp
adores pork, don't you, Miss Sharp?'
And I think this is all the conversation that I remember at dinner.
When the repast was concluded a jug of hot water was placed before Sir
Pitt, with a case-bottle containing, I believe, rum. Mr. IIorrocks servcl
myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine, and a bumper was
poured out for my lady. When he retired, she took from her work-
drawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting; the young ladies
began to play at cribbnge with a dirty pack of cards. We nl but one
candle lighter, but it was in magnificent old siler candlestick, and after a
very few questions from my lady, I had my choice of amusement between
a volume of sermons, and a pamphlet on the corn-laws, which Mr. Crawley
has been reading before dinner.
` So we sat for an hour until steps were learn.
 Put away the cards, girls,' cried a lady, in a great tremor; put
dou Mr. Crawley's books, Miss Shar:' and these orders had been
scarcely obeyed, when Mr. Crawley entered the room.
A N0VEL WITHOUT A PIERO.

 e will resume yesterday's discourse, young ladies,' said he, 'and
you shall each read a page by turns; so that Miss a-Miss Short may
have an opportunity of hearing you;' and the poor girls began to spell a
long visual sermon delivered at bEthesda Chapel, Liverpool, in behalf of
the mission for the Chickasaw Indians. Was it not a charming evening ?
At ten the servants were told to call Sir litt and the household to
prayers. Sir Pitt came in first, very much flushed, and rather unsteady in
his gait; and after him the butler, the cnnurics, Mr, Crawley's man, three
other men, smelling very much of the stable, and four women, one of whom,
I remarked, was very much oer-dressed, and who flung me a look of great
scorn as she plumped down on her knees.
Afer Mr. Crawley had done arranging and expounding, we received
our candles, and then we went to bed; and then I was disturbed in a
writing, as I have described to my dearest sweetest Aelia.
e Good night. A thousand thousand thousand kisses' '
``Saturday.-This morning, at five, I heard the shrieking of the little
black pig. Rose and Violet introduced me to it yesterday; and to the
stables, and to the kennel, and to the gardener, who was picking fit to
send to market, and from whom they begged hard a bunch of hot-house
grapes; but he said that Sir Pitt had numbered every `` Man Jack'' of
them, and it would be as much as his place was worth to give any away.
The darling girls caught a colt in a paddock, and asked me if I would ride,
and began to ride themselves, when the groom, coming with horrid oaths,
drove them away.
``Lady Crawley is always knitting the worstel. Sir Pitt is always tipsy,
every night; and, I believe, sits with Horrocks, the butler. MIr. Crawley
always reads sermons in the evening; and in the morning is locked up in
his study, or else rides to SUdbury, on county business, or to Squashmore,
where he preaches, on Wednesdays and Fridays, to the tenants there.
`' A hundred thousand grateful loves to your dear papa and mamma. Is
your poor brother recovered of his rank-punch? Oh, dear Oh, dear
How men should beware of nickel punch
 Eer and over thine own,
ECc.''
Everything considered, I think it is quite as well for our dear Amelia
Sedley, in Russell Square, that MIss Sharp and she are parted. Rebecca
is a droll funny creature, to be sure: and those descriptions of the poor
lady weeping for the loss of her beauty, and the gentleman ``with lay-
coloured whiskers and straw-coloured hair,'' are very smart, doubtless, and
show a great knowledge of the world. That she might, when on her
knees, have been thinking of something better than Miss IIorroeks's
ribbons, has possibly struck both of us. But my kind reader will place
to remember that these histories in this gaudy yellow covers have
Vanity Fair'' for a title, and that Vanity Fair is a very vain, wicked,
foolish place, full of all sorts of humbugs and Ialsencsses and pretensions.
And while the moralist, who is holding forth on the cover (nn accurate
portrait of your humble servant), professes to wear neither gown nor

bands, but only the very same long-eared livery in which his congregation
is arrayed: yet, look you, one is bound to speak the truth as far as one
knows it, whether one mounts a cap and bells or a shovel-hat; and a
deal of disagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an under-
taking.
I have heard a brother of the story-telling trade, at Naples, preaching
to a pack of good-for-nothing honest lazy fellows by the sea-shore, work
himself up into such n range and passion with some of the villains whose
wicked deeds he was describing and inventing, that the audience could not
resist it; and they and the poet together would burst out into a roar of
months and expectations against the fictitious monster of the tale, so that the
hat went round, and the balochi tumbled into it, in the midst of a perfect
storm of sympathy.
At the little Paris theatres, on the other hand, you will not only hear
the people yelling out ``l gredin / l matre /'' and cursing the tyrant
of the play from the boxes; but the actors themselves positively refuse to
play the wicked parts, such as those of indies fnglais, brutal Cossacks, and
what not, and prefer to appear at a smaller salary, in their real characters
loyal Frenchmen. I set the two stories one against the other, so that you
may see that it is not from mere mercenary motives that the present
performer is desirous to show up and trounced his villains; but because he
has a sincere hatred of them, which he cannot keep down, and which must
find a vent in suitable abuse and bad language.
I warn my ``kind friends,'' then, that I am going to tell a story of harrow-
ing villany and complicated-but, as I trust, intensely interesting-prime.
My rascals are no milk-and-water rascals, I promise you. When we come
to the proper places we won't spare fine language-No, not But when
we are going over the quiet country we must perform be calm. A
tempest in a slop-asin is absurd. We will reserve that sort of thing for
the mighty ocean and the lonely midnight. The present Number will be
very mild. Others-But i will not anticipate those.
And, as we bring our characters forward, I will ask lead, as a man and
a brother, not only to introduce them, but occasionally to step down from
the platform, and talk about then : if they are good and kindly, to love
them and shake them by the hand: if they are silly, to laugh at them
confidentially in the reader's sleeve : if they are wicket and heartless, to
abuse them in the strongest terms which politeness admits of,
Otherwise you might fancy it was I who was sneering at the practice of
devotion, which Miss Sharp finds so ridiculous; that it was I who laughed
good humoured at the reeling old Silenus of a baronet-whereas the
laughter comes from one who has no reference except for prosperity, and
no eye for anything beyond success. Such people there are living and
flourishing in the world-Faithless, Hopeless, Charityless : let us have at
them, dear friends, with might nd main. Some there are, and very suc-
careful too, mere quacks and fools: and it was to combat and expose such
as those, no doubt, that Laughter was male.

with all the friends and intimatcs of her youth, who, of course, could not

rank and abode any persons who were willing to welcome her. Who ever

the Wapshot girls had not the preference in the marriage, and the remain-

As the only endowments with which Nature had gift Lady Crawley
were those of pink cheeks and n white skin, and as she had no sort of

The languid illness of their nma did not, as it may be supposed,
awaken much affection in her little daughters, but they were very happy i
the servants' hall and in the stables; and the Scotch gardener having luckily
a good wife and some good children, they got a little wholesome society
and instruction in his lodge, which was the only education bestowed upon
them until Miss Sharp came.
HIr engagement was owing to the remonstrants of Mr, Pitt Crawley,
the only friend or protector Lady Crawley ever had, and the only person,
besides her children, for whom she entertained a little feeble attachment.
Mr. Pitt took after the noble Clinics, from whom he was descended, and
was a very polite and proper gentleman. When he grew to man's estate,
nnl same bse from Christchurch, he began to reform the blackened disc-
line of the hall, in spite of his father, who stood in we of him. He was
 man of such rigid refinement, that he would have starved rather than
have died without a white week-eloth. Once, when just from college, and
when HIorroeks the butler brought him a letter without placing it premi-
focus on a tray, he gave that domestic a look, and administered to him a
speech so cutting, that IIorrocks ever after trembled before him: the whole
household bowel to him: Lady Crawley's curl-papers came off earlier
when he was a home : Sir it's buddy sites disappeared; and if that
incorrigible old man still adhered to other old habits, he never huddled
himself with rum and water in his son's presence, and only talked to his
ervts in a very reserved and polite manner; and those persons remarked
that Sir Pitt never swore at Lady Crawley while his son was in the room.
It was he who taught the butler to say `` My lady is served,'' und who
insisted on handing her ladyship into dinner. IIe seldom spoke to her,
but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let
her quit the apartment, without rising in the most stately manner to open
the door, and making an elegant low at her egress.
At lEmon he was called Miss Crawley; and there, I am sorry to say, his
younger brother Rawdon used to pick him violently. But though his parts
were not brilliant, he made up for his lack of talent by meritorious industry,

and was never known, during eight years at school, to hc subject to that
punishment, which it is generally thought one but a cherub can escape.
At college his career was of course highly crelitable. And here he pre-
pared himself for public life, intowhich he was to be introduced by the patron-
age of his grandfather, Lord Binkie, by studying the ancient and modern
orators with great passivity, and by speaking unceasingly at the debating
societies. But though he had a fine flux of words, and delivered his little
voice with great pomposity and pleasure to himself, and never advanced
any sentiment or opinion which was not perfectly trite and stale, nd sup-
ported by a Latin quotation:; yet he failed somehow, in spite of a medi-
city which ought to have insured any man n success. He did not even
get the prize poem, which all his friends said he was sure of.
After leaving college he became Private Secretary to Lord Binkie, and
was then appointed Attache to the Legation ut Pupernickel, which post
he filled with perfect honour, and brought home despatches, consisting of
Strasburg pie, to the Foreign Minister of the day. After remaining ten
years Attach (several years after the lamented Lord Binkie's demise), and
finding the advancement slow, he at length gave up the diplomatic service
in some disgust, and began to turn country gentlemen.
He wRote a pamphlet on Malt on returning to England (for he was
an ambitious man, and always like to bE before the public), and took a
strong part in the Negro Emancipation question. Then he became a
friend of MIr. Wilberforce's, whose politics he admired, and had the
famous correspondence with the Reverend Silas Hornblower, on the
Ashgate Mission. He was in Loudon, if not for the Parliament session,
at least in May, for the religions meetings. In the country he was a
magistrate, and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute
of religious instruction. He was said to be paying his addresses to Lady
Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdowu's third laughter, and whose sister,
Lady Emily, wrote those sweet treats, ``The Sailor's True Pinnacle,'' and
tHe Appleton of Pinochle Common,''
Miss sharp's account of his employment at queen's Crawley were not
caricatures. He subjected the servants there to the devotional exercises
before mentioned, in which (and so much the better) he brought his father
to join. He patroniscd an independent meeting-house in Crawley parish,
much to the indignation of his uncle the rector, and to the consequent
delight of Sir Pitt, who was induced to go himself once or twice, which
oecusioned some violent sermons at Crawley parish church, directed point-
blank at the Baronet's old gothic pew there. COntest Sir Pitt, however,
did not feel the force of these discourses, us he always took lis nap during
sermon-time.
Mr. Crawley was very earnest, for the good of the nation and of the
Christian world, that the old gentleman should yield him up his place in
Parliament ; but this the elder constantly refused to do. bOth were of
course too prudent to give up the fifteen hundred a enr which was
brought in by the second seat (at this period filled by MIr. balloon,
with carte-blanche on the Slave question); indeed the family estate was
much embarrassed, and the income drawn from the borough was of great
use to the house of queen's Crawley.

AIRY FAIR.
It and never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawley,
first baronet, for population in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office. Sir
Walpole was a jolly fellow, eager to seize and to spend money (``alien
happens, sui profess,'' as Mr. Crawley would remark with a high), and in
his day beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and hopi-
tality which was maintained at queen's Crawley. The cellars were filled
with burgundy than, the kennels with hounds, and the stables with gallant
hunters; now, such horses as queen's Crawley possessed went to plough,
or ran in the Trafalgar Coach ; and it was with a team of these very
horses, on an off-day, that Miss Sharp was brought to the Hall ; for, book
as he was, Sir Pitt was a stickler for his dignity while at home, and seldom
drove out but with four horses, and, though he dined off boiled mutton,
had always three footmen to serve it.
If mere parsimony would have made a man rich, Sir Pitt Crawley might
have become very wealthy-if he had been an attorney in a country town,
with no capital but his brains, it is very possible that he would have
turned them to good account, and might have achieved for himself a very
considerable influence and competency. But he was unlucky endowed
with a good name and a large though encumlered estate, both of which
went rather to injure than to advance him. HE had a taste for law,
which cost him many thousands yearly; and being a great deal too clever
to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his affairs to
be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all cqally mistrusted. IIe was
such n sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt
tenants; and such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the need to the
ground, whereupon vengeful Nature grudge him the crops which she
granted to more liberal lusbantmen. Ile speculated in every possible
way; he worked mines ; bought canal-shares; horsed coaches; took
goverment contracts, and was the busiest man and magistrate of his
county. As he would not pay honest agents at his granite-quarry, he had
the satisfaction of finding that four overseers ran away, and took fortunes
with them to America. For want of proper precautions, his coal-mines
filled with water : the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon
his hands: and for his coach-horses, every mail proprietor in the kingdom
knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country, from under-
feeding and buying cheap. In disposition he was sociable, and far from
being proud; nay, hc rather preferred the society of a farmer or a horse-
dealer to that of a gentleman, like my Lord, his son: he was fond
of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was never
known to give away a shilling or to do a good action, but was of a
pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his glass
with a tenant and sell him up the next day; or have his laugh with the
poacher he was transporting with equal good humour. lis politeness for
the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca Sharp-in a word,
the whole baronetage, peerage, commoners of England, did not contain a
more cunning, men, selfish, foolish, disreputable old man. That blood-
red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in anybody's pocket except his
own; and it is with grief and pain, that, as admirers of the British
aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to admit the existence of so many ill
qualities in a person whose name is in Debrett.

One great cause why Mr. Crawley hal such a loll over the affections
of his father, resulted from money arrangements. The Burnet owed his
son a sum of money out of the juncture of his mother, which he did not
find it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnant
to paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to discharge his
debts. Miss Sharp calculated (for she bene, as we shall hcnr speedily,
inducted into most of the secrets of the family) that the mere payment of
his creditors cost the honourable baronet several hundreds yearly; but
this was a delight he could not forego ; he had a savage pleasure iu making
the poor wretches wait, and in shifting from court to court mud from term
to her the period of satisfaction. What's the good of being in parliament,
he said, if you must pay your debts Hence, indeed, his position as a
senator was not a little useful to him

state. He was high sheriff, and rode in a golden cone. Gret ministers
and statesmen courted him; and in Vanity lair he had a higher place the

Sir Pitt had an unmarried half-sister who inherited her mother's target for-
tune, and though the Baronet proposed to borrow this money of her on mort-
gage, Miss Crawley declined the offer, and preferred the security of the
funds. She had signified, however, her intention of leaving her inheritanes
between Sir Pitt's second son and the family at the rectory, and lead once
or twice paid the debts of Haddon Crawley in his career at college and
in the army. Miss Crawley was, in consequence, an object of great respect
when she came to queen's Crowley, for she had a balance at her banker's

With the young people, whose applause she thoroughly gained, her

much learning, but, on the contrary, let them have their own way in regard
to cucating themselves; for what instruction is more ineffectual tlan self-

as it were, in playing, to impart a great deal of instruction to Miss Rose

Monsieur Crbillon the roger, whom r immortal poet Gray so much
admired, and of the universal Monsieur de Yolairc. Once, when Mr.

own skill in speaking the French language, (for he was of the world still),
and not a little pleased with the compliments which the governess conti-
nually paid him upon hifieney.
Miss Violet's tastes were, ch the contrary, more rude and boisterous
than those of her sister.- She knew the sequestered spots where the hens

his speech at the uashimaboo-Aid Society; took an interest in his
pamphlet on malt; was often affected, even to tears, by his discourses of
an evening, and would say-`' Oh, thank you, sir,'' with a sigh, and a
look up to heaven, that made him occasionally condensed to shake hands
with her. :Blood is everything, after all,'' would that aristocratic
religionist sny.  How Miss Sharp is awakened by my words, when not
one of the people here is touched. I am too fine for them-too delicate.
I must familiarise my style-but she understands it. Her mother was as
Montmorency.''
Indeed it was from this famous family, as it appears, that Miss Sharp,
by the mother's side, was descended. Of course she did not say that her
mother had been on the stage; it would have shocked Mr, Crawley's
religious scruples. How many noble empire had this horrid revolution
plunged in poverty She had several stories about her ancestors ere she
had been many months in the house; some of which MIr. Crawley hap-
pened to find in D'DOzier's dictionary, which was in the library, and
which strengthened his belief in their truth, and in the high-breeding ol
Rebecca. Are we to suppose from this curiosity and prying into diction-
aries, could our heroine suppose that Mr. Crawley was interested in her -
to, only in a friendly way. Have we not stated that he was attached to
Lady Jane Sheephanks:
He took Rebecca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at
backgammon with Sir Pitt, saying that it was a godless amusement, and
that she would be much better engaged in reading `` Trump's Legacy,''
or  The Blind Wuasherwoman of Moorfelds,'' or any work of a more
serious nature; but Miss hrp sil he lear mother used often the pl
the same game with the old Court de Tristram and the venerable Abb du
Cornet, and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusement.
But it was not only by playing at backgammon with the Baronet, that
the little governess rendered herself agreeable to her employer. She
found many different ways of being useful to him. She real over, with
indefatigable patience, all those law papers, with which, before she came to
queen's Crawley, he had promised to entertain her. She volunteered to
copy many of his letters, and adroitly altered the spelling of them so as
to suit the usages of the present day. She became interested in every-
thing pertaining to the estate, to the farm, the park, the garden, and
the stables; and so delightful a companion was she, that the Baronet
would seldom take his after-breakfast walk without her (and the children
of course), when she would give her advice as to the trees which were to be
lopped in the shrubberies, the garden-bell to be dug, the crops which
were to be cut, the horses which were to go to cart or plough. Before
she had been a year at Queen's Crawley she had quite won the Bnronet's
confidence ; and the conversation at the dinner-table, which before used to
be held between him and Mr, Horrocks the butler, was now almost club-
lively between Sir Pitt and Miss Sharp. She was almost mistress of the
house alien Mr. Crawley was absent, but conducted herself in her new and
exalted situation with such circumspeetion and modesty as not to offend the
authorities of the kitchen and stable, among whom her behaviour was
always exceedingly modest and affable. She was quite a different person

from the haughty, shy, dissatisfied little girl whom we have known pre-
house, and this change of temper proved great prudence, a sincere desire of
amendment, or at any rate great moral courage on her part. WHether it
was the heart which dictated this new system of compliance and humility
adopted by our Rebecca, is to be proved by her after-history. A system
of hypocrisy, which lasts through whole years, is one seldom satisfactorily
practised by a person of one-and-twenty ; however, our readers will recoil-
lect, that, though young in years, our heroine was all in life and experience,
and we have written to no purpose if they have not discovered that she
was a very clever woman.
1he elder and younger son of the house of Crawley were, like the gentle-
man and lady in the weather-box, never at home together-they hated each
other coriully: indeed, Rawdon Crawley, thc dragoon, had a great con-
tempt for the establishment altogether, and seldom came thither except
when his aunt paid her annual visit.
The great good quality of this old lady has been mentioned. She pos-
caused seventy thousand pounds, and has almost adopted Rawlon. She
disliked her elder nephew exceedingly, and despised him as a milksop.
In return he did not hesitate to state that her soul was irretrievably lost,
and was of opinion that his brother's chance in the next world was not a
whit better.  She is a godless women of the world,'' would Mr. Crawley
say; ``she lives with atheists and Frenchmen. My mind shoulders when I
think of her awful, awful situation, and that, near ns she is to the grave, she
should be so given up to vanity, licentiousness, profaneness, and folly.'' In
fact, the old lady declined altogether to hear his hour's lecture of an een-
in; and when she came to queen's Crawley alone, he was obliged to
pretermit his usual devotional exercises.
`` Shut up your sermons, Pitt, when Miss Crawley comes down,'' said
his father; ``she has written to say that she won't stand the preachifying.''
 O, girl consider the servants,''
 The servants be hanged,'' said Sir Pitt; and his son thought even
worse would happen were they deprived of the benefit of his instruction.
 Wy, hang it, Pitt.'' said the father to his remonstrance. You
wouldn't be such a flat as to let three thousand a year go out of the
family ?'
e What is money compared to our souls, sir%'' continued Crawley.
 You mean that the old lady won't leave the money to you ''-and
who knows but it as Mr. Crawley's meaning %
Old Miss Crawley was certainly one of the reprobate. She had a snug
little house in Park Lane, and, as she ate and drank a great deal too much
during the season in London, she went to Harrowgate or Cheltenham for
the summer. She was the most hospitable and jovial of all vestals, and
had been a beauty in her day, she said. (All old women were beauties one
we very well kno.) She was a lel esprit, and n dreadful Radical for
those days. She had been in France (where St. Just, they sy, inspired
her with an unfortunate passion), and loved, ever after, french novels,
French cookery, and french wines. She read voltaire, and had Rousseau
by heart; talked very lightly about divorce, and most energetically of the
rights of women. She had pictures of Mr. Fox in every room in the

house: when that statesman was in opposition, I am not sure that the
ad not flung a main with him; and when he came into office, she took
great credit for bringing over to him Sir Pitt and his colleague for queen's
Crawley, although Sir Pitt would have come over himself, without any
trouble on the honest lady's part. It is needless to say that Sir Pitt was
brought to change his views after the death of the great Whig statesman.
This worthy old lady took a fancy to Rawdon Crawley when a boy,
sent him to Cambridge (in opposition to his brother and Oxford), and, when
the young man was requested by the authorities of the first-named Univer-
sity to quit after a residence of two years, she bought him his commissions
in the Life Guards Green.
A perfect and celebrated ``tool,'' or andy about town, was this
young officer. Boxing, rat-hunting, the fives' court, and four-in-hand
driving were then the fashion of our British aristocracy; and he was an
adept in all these noble sciences. And though he belonged to the house-
holl troops, who, as it was their duty to rally round the Prince Regent,
hd not shown their valour in foreign service yet, Rawlon Crawley had
already (apropos of play, of which he was immoderately fond) fought three
bloody duels, in which he gave ample proofs of his contempt for death.
And for what follows after death,'' would Mr. Crawley observe,
throwing his gooseberry-coloured eyes up to the ceiling. He was always
thinking of his brother's soul, or of the souls of those who differed with
him in opinion: it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give
themselves.
Silly, romantic Miss Crawley, far from being horrified at the courage
of her favorite, always used to pay his debts after his duels; and would
not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality. : He will
now his wild-oats,'' she would,say, '` and is worth far more than that ruling
hypocrite of a brother of his,''

The Reverend Bute
Crawley was a tall,
stately, jolly, shovel-
hatted man, far more
popular in his county than the Baronet lis brother. At college he pulled
stroke-or in the Christchurch boat, and had thrashed all the best cruisers
of the ``town.'' He carried is taste for boxing an athletic exercises
into private life: there was not a fight within twenty miles at which lc
was not present, for a race, for a coursing match, for a regatta, nor
a ball, for an election, for a visitation dinner, nor indeed a good dinner

whenever there was any dinnerparty at Fuddleston, or at Robby, or nt
Wapshot Hull, or at the great lords of the county, with all of whom he
was intimate. IIe had a fine voice; sang `` A southerly wind and a cloudy
sky;'' and give the `'whoop'' in chorus with general applause. He rode
to hounds in a pepper-and-salt rock, and was one of the best fishermen
in the county.
Mrs. Crawley, the rector's wife, was a smart little body, who wrote this
worthy divine's sermons. Being of a domestic turn, and keeping the
house a great deal with her daughters, she ruled absolutely within the
reetory, wisely giving her husband full liberty without. He was welcome
to come and go, and dine abroad as many days as his fancy dictated, for
Mrs. Crawley was a saving woman and knew the price of port wine.
Ler since MIrs. Bute carried of the young rector of Queen's Crawley (she
was of a good family, daughter of the late Lieut.-Colonel Hector MaeTavish,
and she and her mother played for Bute and won him at Hlarrogate), she

his college bills contracted during his father's life time. In the year 170-,
when he was just clear of these incumbrnnces, he gave the odds of
100 to 1 (in twenties) against Kangaroo, who won the Derby. The
rector was obliged to take up the money at a ruinous interest, and had
been struggling eer since. Isis sister helped him with a hundred now
and then, but of course his great hope was in her death-when `hang
it' (as he would say), `Mention nst leave me half her money.'

awdon, it was know, was to come in for the bulk of MIss Crawley's
properly. Lives money transactions-these speculations in life and
death-these silent battles for diversionary spoil-mako brothers very
loving towards each other in Vanity Fair. I, for my part, have down
a five-pound-note to interpose and knock up a half century's attaclunecut
between two brethren; and can't but dire, as I think what a fiuc and
double thing Love is among worldly people.
lt cannot bc supposed that the arrival of such a personage as Rebecca
at ucen's Crawley, and ler gradual establishment in the good graces of
all people there, could be remarked by Mrs. Bute Crawley. Ms. Bute,
who knew how many days the sirloin of beef lasted at the Hall; how
much linen was got ready at the great was; how many peaches were on
the south wall; how many doses her lulyship took when she was ill-for
such points are matters of intense interest to certain persons in the
country-MIrs. But, I say, could not pass over the Hull governess
without making every inquiry respecting her history and character. There
was always the best understanding between the servants at the Rectory
and the Hall. There was always a good glass of sale in the kitchen of lie
former place for the IIall people, whose ordinary drink was very small-
and, indeed, the Rector's lady knew exactly how much melt went to every
barrel of IIall beer-times of relationship existed between the IIall and
Rectory domestic, as between their masters; and through these channels
each film was perfectly well acquainted with the doings of the other.
That, by the way, may be set down as a general remark. When you and
your brother are friends, his doings are indifferent to you. When you
have quarrelled, all his outgoings and incoming you know, as if you
were his spy.
Very soon then after her arrival, Rebecca began to take a regular place in
Mrs. Crawley's bulletin from the HAll. It was to this effect :-``The black
worker's killed-weighed  stone-salted the sides-pig's pudding and
leg of work for dinner. Mr. Camp, from Sudbury, over with Sir Pitt
about putting Joh Blackmore in gaol-Mr. itt at meeting (with all the
names of the people who attended)--my lady as usual-the young ladies
with the governess.''
Then the report would come-the new governess be a rare manager-
Sir Pitt be very sweet on her-Mr, Crawley too--lle be reading tracts to
her-What an abandoned wretch.'' snidl little, eager, active, black-faced
Mrs. Bute Crawley.

Finally, the reports were that the governess had `'` come round''
everybody, wrote Sir Pitt's letters, did his business, managed his
accounts-had the upper hand of the whole louse, my lady, MIr. Crawley,
the girls and all-at which Mrs. Crawley declared she was an artful
hussey, and had some dreadful designs in view. Thus te goings at the
Hall were the great fool for conversation at the Rectory, and MIrs. lUte's
bright eyes spied out everything that took place in the enemy's camp-
everything and a great deal besides.

 Presenting my respectful compliments to Indy Fuddleston, I have
the honour (epistolary) to introduce to her ladyship my two friends, Miss
Tuffin and Miss IIawky.
 Either of these young ladies is per/ect gualifel to instruct in Greek,
Latin, and the rudiments of IIecbrew; in mathematics and history; in
Spanish, French, Italian, and geegrply; in music, vocal and winter-
mental ; in dancing, without the aid of n master; and in the elements of
natural sciences. In the use of the globes both are proficient. In
addition to these, Miss Tuffiu, who is daughter of the late several
Thomas Tuffin, (Fellow of Corpus College, Cambridge,) can instruct in the
Syriac language, and the elements of Constitutional law. But as she is
only eighteen years of age, and of exceedingly pleasing personal appearance,
perhaps this young ludy ay be objectionable in Sir Hudlleston Found
son's family.
Miss Letitia Hawks, on the other hand, is not personally well-favoured.
Who is twenty-nine; her face is much pitted with the small-pox. She has
a halt in hcr gait, rel hair, and a trifling obliquity of vision. Both

P.S. The Miss Ship, whom you mention as governess to Sir Pitt
Crawley, Bart., M.P,, was a pupil of mine, and I have nothing to say in
her disfavour. Though her appearance is disagrceable, we cannot control
the operations of nature: and though her parents were disreputable (her
father being a painter, several times bankrupt; and her mother, as I have
since learned, with horror, a dancer at the Opera); yet her talents are con-
desirable, and I cannot regret that I received cr out of charity. My
dread is, lest the principles of the mother-who was represented to me as
a French Countess, forced to emigrate in the late revolutionary horrors;
but who, as lIL have since found, was a person of the very lowest order and
morals-should at any time prove to be Hereditary in the unhappy young
woman whom I took as an outcast. But her principles have twitter been

coal-mines, canals, with Sir Pitt (whose secretary I am become); after
dinner, Mr. Crawley's discourses or the baronet's backgammon; during both
of which amusements my lady looks on with equal acidity. She has
become rather more interest by being ailing of late, which has brought
a new visitor to the Hall, in the person of a young doctor. Well, my

Crawley is made to put on the brightest pen-grown in her wardrobe, and
y pupils leave off their thick shoes and tight old tartan plisses, and
wear silk stockings and muslin frocks, as fashionable bayonets' daughters
should. Rose cnc in yesterday in a sal plight-the Wiltshire sow (n
enormous pet of hera) ran her down, and destroyed in most lovely flowered

Pitt would anne sworn frightfully, have boxed the poor wrcetch's cnrs, and
put her upon bread and water for a month. All he said was, T'Il were
you out, Miss, when your aunt's gone,' and laughed off the accident as
quite trivial. Let us hope his wr:tl will he passed away before MIss
Crawley's departure. I hope so, for Miss Rose's sake, I am sure. What

mean the baronet and the rector, not oar brothers-but the former, who
hate each other all the year round, become quite loving at Christmas. I wrote
to you last year how the abominable horse-racing rector was in the habit
of preaching clumsy sermons at us at church, and how Sir Pitt stored in
answer-when Miss Crawley arrives there is no such thing as quarreling
heard of-the Hall visits the Rectory, and since oerai-the person and the
baronet talk about the pigs and the poachers, and the county business,
in the most affable manner, and without quarreling in their cups, I believe
-indeed Miss Crawley won't hear of their quarreling, and vows that she
will leave her money to the Shropshire Crawleys if they offend her. If.
they were clever people those Shropshire Crawleys they might have it all,
I think ; but the Shropshire Crley is a clergyman like lis Hampshire
cousin, and mortally offended Miss Crawley (who had fled hitler in a fit
of rage against her impracticable brethren) by some strait-laced notions
of morality. HBo would have prayers in the house, I believe.
 Our sermon-books are shut up whan Mss Crawley arrives, and Mr.
Pitt, whom she dominates, finds it convenient to go to tow. On the
other hand, the young. dundy, good, I believe, is the term, Captain Craw-
lay makes his appearance, and I suppose you would like to know what
sort of a person he is.
eWell, he is a very large young andy. He is six feet high, and
speaks with a great voice; and swears a great deal; and orders about the
servant, who all adore lim nevertheless; for he is very generous of his
money, and the domestic will do anything for him. Last week the
keepers almost killed n bniliff and his man who came down from London
to arrest the Captain, and who were found lurking about the Park wall-
they beat them, ducked them, and were going to shoot them for poachers,
but the baronet interfered.
 The Captain has a hearty contempt for his father, I can see, and calls
him an old put, an old vol, an old cla-bacon, and merciless other
pretty names. He has a dreadful reputation among the ladies. He
brings his hunters home with him, lives with the Squires of the county,
asks whom he pleases to dinner, and Sir pItt dudes not say no, for fear
of offending Miss Crawley, and missing his legacy when she dies of her
apoplexy. Sall I tell you a compliment the Captain pid mef I must,
it is so pretty. One evening we actually had a dance; there was Sir
Hndlleston uddleston and his family, Sir Giles Wapshot and his young
ladies, and I don't know how many more. Well, I heard him say-' By
jove, she 's a neat little silly1' meaning your humble servant; and he did
me the honour to dance two country-dances with me. He- gets on pretty
gnily with the young Squires, with whom he drinks, bets, rides and talks
about hunting and shooting; but he says the country girls ure loves,;
indeed, I don't think he is far wrong. YOu should see the contempt with
which they look down on poor mel When they dance I sit and play
the piano very securely ; but the other night coming in rather flushed
from the dining-room, and seeing me employed in this way, he swore out

 Here they are. 'Is the very image of them. Lieu, adieu1''
When Mrs. Bute Crawley (whose artifices our ingenious Rebecca had
so soon discovered) had procured from Miss Sharp the promise of a visit,
she induced the all-powerful Miss Crawley to make the necessary applied-
tion to Sir Pitt, and the good-naturel old lady, who loved to be gay her-
self, and to see every one gay and happy round about her, was quite
charmed, and ready to establish a reconciliation and intimacy between her
two brothers. It was therefore agreed that the young people of both
92
VANITY 1AIR.
families should visit cach other frequently for the future, and the friend-
ship of course lasted as long as the jovial old mediatrix was there to keep
the peace.
wHy did you ask that scoundrel, Rawdou Crawley, to dine'' said the
Rector to his lady, as they were walking home through the park. Don't
want the fellow. He looks down upon us country people as so many
blaekamoors. He's never content unless he gets my yellow-sealed wine,
which costs me ten shillings a bottle, hang him? Besides, he's such an
infernal character-he 's a gambler-he's a drunkard-he's a profligate
in every way. IIe's killed a man in a duel-he's over heal and ears in
debt, and he's robbed me and mine of the best part of Miss Crawley's
fortune. Waxy says she has him ''-here the Rector shook his fist but the
moon, with something very like an oath, and added, in a melancholious
tone-''-, down in her will for fifty thousand; and there won't be abc
thirty to divide.''
I think she's going,'' said the Rector's wife. `She was very red in
the face when we left dinner. I was obliged to place her.''
`She drank seven glasses of champagne,'' said the reverend gentleman,
in a low voice; ``und filthy champagne it is, too, that my brother poisons
us with-but you women never know what's what.''
Me know nothing,'' said MIrs. Bute Crawley.
``She drank elerry-brandy after dinner,'' continued his Reverence,
'` and took curcao with her coffee. I wouldn't take a glass for a five-
pound note: it kills me with heart-burn. She can't stand it, Mrs.
Crawley-she must go-flesh and blood won't bear it and I lay five to
two, Matilda drops in a year.''
Indulging in these solemn speculations, and thinking about his debts,
and his son Jim at College, and Frank at Woolwich, and the four girls,
who were no beauties, poor things, and would not have a penny but what
they got from the aunt's expected legacy, the Rector and his lady walked
on for a while.
 Pitt can't be such an infemnal villain as to sell tlc reversion of the
living. And that Methodist milksop of an eldest son looks to Prius-
ment,'' continued Mr. Crawley, after a pase.
Sr Pitt Crawley will do anything,'' said the elector's will.  Ie
just get Miss Crawley to make him promise it to James,''
 Pitt will promise anything,'' replied the brother. ` He promised
he 'd pay my college bills, when my father died : he promised he'd build
the new wing to the Rectory: he promised e'd let me have Gibb's field
and the Six-acre Meadow-and much he executed his promises And
it's to this man's son-this scoundrcl, gambler, swindler, murderer of
a lawson Crawley that Mutila leaves the bulk of her money. I say it's
un-Christian. Dy Jove, it is. The infamous dog has got every vice
except hypocrisy, and that belongs to his brother.''
`Hush, my dearest loeb we 're in Sir Pitt's grounds,'' interposed lis
wife.

the Cheshire Trump, by which I lost forty pound? You know he did;
and as for the women, why, you heard that before me, in my own magis-
rates' room--''
``For Heaven's she, Mr. Crawley,'' said the lady, ``spare me the
details.''
`And you ask this villain into your house l'' continued the exasperated
Rector. `` You, the mother of a young family-the wife of a clergyman of
the Church of England. By Jove1
 Bute Crawley, you are a fool,'' said the Rector's wife, seornfully.
 Well, Ma'am, fool or not-and I don't say, Martha, 1'm so clever as
you are, I never did. But I won't meet Rawvdon Crawley, that's fat.
I'll go over to Hudlleston, that I will, and see his black greyhound, MIrs.
Crawley; and I'll run Laneelot against him for fifty. By Jove, I will;
or against any dog in England. But I won't meet that beast Rawdon
Crowley,''
Mr. Crawley, you are intoxicated, as usual,'' replied his wife. And
the next morning, when the Elector woke, and called for small beer, she
put him in mind of his promise to visit. Sir Huddleston Fuddleston, on
saturday, and as he knew he should have a et night, it was recall
that he might gallop back again in time for clich on Sunday morning.
Thus it will be seen that the parishioners of Crawley were equally happy
in their squire and in their rector.
Miss Crawley had not long been established at the Hall before rebecca's
fascination had won the heart of that good-natured London rake, as they
had of the country innocents whom we have been describing. making her
accustomed drive, one day, she thought it to order that ` that little gover-
ness'' should accompany her to Sudbury. Before they had returned
Rebecca had made a conquest of her; having made her laugh four times,
and amused her during the whole of the little journey.
 Not let Miss Sharp dine t tables'' said she to Sir Pitt, who had
arranged a dinner of ceremony, and asked all the neighbouring bayonets.
 My dear creature, do you suppose I can talk about the nursery with
LAdy uddleston, or discuss justices' business with that goose, old Sir
Giles Wapshot? I insist upon Miss Sharp appearing. Let Lady Crawley
remain up stairs, if there is no room. But little Miss Sharp Why,
she 's the only person fit to talk to in the county''
Of course, after such a peremptory order as this, Miss Sharp, the
governess, received commands to dine with the illustrious company below
stairs. And when Sir Huddleston had, with great pomp and ceremony,
handed Miss Crawley into dinner, and was preparing to take his place by
her side, the old lady cries out, in a shrill voice. Becky Sharp Miss
harp Coe eu ad sit by me and amuse me: and let Sir kluddleston
sit by Lady Wapshot.''
When the parties were over, and the carriages had rolled away, the insa-
table Miss Crawley would say, ``Come to my dressing-room, Becky, and
let s abuse the company,''-which, between them, this pair of friends
did perfectly. Old Sir Huddleston wheeled a great deal at dinner; Sir
Giles Wapshot had a particularly noisy manner of imbibing his soup, and

ler ladyship a win of the left eye; all of which Becky caricatured to
radiation; as well as the particulars of the night's conversation; the
politics; the war; the quarter-sessions; the famous run with the H. H.,
and those heavy and dreary themes, about which country gentlemen
converse. As for the Misses Wapshots' toilette and Lady Fuddleston's
famous yellow hat, Miss Sharp tore them to tatters, to the infinite amuse-
ment of her audience.
 My dear, you are a perfect trouble,'' Miss Crawley would say. I
ish you could come to me in London, but I couldn't make a butt of you
as I do of poor Briggs,-no, no, you little sly creature ; you are too clever
-Isn't she, Firing?''
Mrs. Firkin (who was dressing the very small remnant of hair which
remained on Miss Crawley's pate), flung up her head and said, ` I think
Miss i very clever,'' with the most killing sarcastic air. In fact, Mrs.
Firkin hel that natural jealousy which is one of the main principles of every
honest woman,
After rcbuffing Sir IIuddlcston Fuddleston, Miss Crawley ordered that
Rnwdon Crawley should lead her into dinner every day, and that Becky
should follow with her cushion-or else she would have Becky's arm and
Rawdon with the pillow.  We must sit together,'' she said. : We're
the only three Christians in the county, my love''-in which case, it must
be confessed, that religion was at a very low ebb in the county of Hints.
Besides being such a fine religious, Miss Crawley was, as we have said,
in Ultra-liberal in opinions and always took occasion to express these in
the most candid manner.
 What is birth, my dear ?'' she would say to Rebecca-'' Look at my
brother Pitt; look at the Huddleston, who have been here since Henry
II., look at poor But at the parsonage ;-are any one of the equal to you
in intelligence or breeding?' Equal to do-they are not been equal to
poor dear Briggs, my companion, or Bowls, my butler. You, my love,
are a little paragon-positively a little jewel-ou hae more brains than
half the shire-if merit had its reward, you ought to be a Duchess-no,
there ought to be no duchesses at all-but you ought to have no superior,
and I consider you, my love, as my equal in every respect; and-will you
put some coals on the fire, my dear; and will you pick this dress of mine,
and alter it, you who can do it so well2'' So this old philanthropist used
to make her equal run of her errands, execute her millinery, and read her to
sleep with French novels, every night.
At this time, as some old readers may recollect, the genteel world had

as the papers say, might give employment to gentlemen of the long robe.
Ensign Shafton hal run away with Lady Barbara Fixture, the Earl of
Bruin's daughter and heiress ; and poor Vere Vane, a gentleman who, up
to forty, had maintained a most respectable character and reared a
numerous Family, suddenly and outrageously left his home, for the sake of
Mrs. Rougemont, the actress, who was sixty-five years of age.

WHen Miss Rebecca Sharp wrote to her beloved friend the account of
the little ball at men's Crawley, and the manner in which, for the first
time, Captain Crawley, had distinguished her, she did not, strange to
relate, gie an altogether accurate account of the transaction. The Captain
had distinguished her a great number of times before. The Captain had
met her in a half-score of walks. he Captain hal lighted upon her in
half-hundred of corridors and passages. The Captain had hung over her
piano twenty times of an evening, as (My Lady was now up stairs, being
ill, and nobody heedcd her) she sang. The Captain had written her notes
(the best that the great blundering dragoon could devise and spell; but
dulness gets on as well as any other quality with women). But when he
put the first of the notes into the lives of the song she was singing, the
little governess, rising and looking him steadily in the face, took up the
triangular missive dainty, and waved it about as if it were a cocked hat,
and she, advancing to the enemy popped the note into the fire, and
made him a very low curtsey, and went back to her place, and began to
sing away again more merrily than ever,
 What's that?'' said Miss Crawley, interrupted in her after-dinner
love by the stoppage of the music.
iT's a false note,'' Miss Sharp said, with a laugh; and Rawdon
Crawley fumed with rage and mortification.

order to Crawley parsonage-whither Miss Crawley came too; and as their
mamma was ill, why not the children with Miss Sharp? So the children
(little dears ) came with Miss Sharp; and of an evening some of the party
would walk back together. Not Miss Crawley-she preferred her car-
rage-but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little park
wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the checkered avenue to
queen's Crawley, was charming in the moonlight to two such lovers of
the picturesque as the Captain and Miss Rebecca.
O those stars, those stars'' Miss Rebecca would say, turning her
twinkling green eyes up towards them. I feel myself almost a spirit
when I gaze upon them,''
O-ah-Gad-yes, so do I exactly, Miss Sharp,'' the other tenth-
siast replied.  You don't mind my cigar, do you, Miss Sharp'' Miss
Sharp loved the smell of a cigar out of doors beyond everything in the
world-and she just tasted one too, in the prettiest way possible, and gave
a little puf, and a little scream, and a little giggle, und restored the deli-

E must now take leave of Malaria, and
those amiable people practising the rural
virtues there, and travel back to London,
to inquire what has become of Miss Malia.
 We don't care a fig for her,'' writes
some unknown correspondent with a pretty
little hand-writing and a pink seal to her
note. '' She is ,false and insipid,'' and
adds some more kind remarks in this strain,
which I should never have repeated at all,
but that they are in truth prodigiously com-
plimentary to the young lady whom they
concern.
BIas the beloved reader, in his experience
of society, ever heard similar remarks by
good-natured female friends; who always
wonder what you can see in Miss Smith that
is so fascinating; or what could induce Major
Jones to propose for the silly insignificant
simmering Miss Thompson, who has nothing but her wax-doll face to
recommend her What is there in a pair of pink access and blue eyes

and a ladylike knowledge of botany and geology, the kickoff making
poetry, the power of rattling sonatas in the Herz-manner, and so forth, are
Far more valuable endowments for n female, than those fugitive charms
which a few years will inevitably tarnish. It is quite edifying to hear
omen speculate upon the worthlessncss and the duration of beauty.
But though virtue is a much finer thing, and those hapless creatures

in mind of the fate which awaits them; and though, very likely, the crime
female character which ladies admire is a more glorious and beautiful
object than the kind, fresh, smiling, artless, tender little domestic goless,
whom men are inclined to worship-yet the latter and inferior sort of
women must have this consolation-that the men do admire them after all;
nand that, in spite of all our kind friends' warnings and protests, we go on
in our desperate error and folly, and shall to the end of the chapter.

Blk was not a word to say for herself; yet I know that I have and the
most delightful conversations with Mrs. BLacks (of course, my dear Madam,
they are insiolable): I see all the men in a cluster round Mrs. White's
chair : all the young fellows battling to dance with MIss down: and so
I am tempted to think that to be despised by her sex is a very great com-
pliment to a woman.
Tlc young ladies in Amelia's society did this for her very satisfactorily.
FOr instance, there was scarcely any point upon which the Miss Osborne,
Core's sisters, and the Meslemoisellces Dobbin agreed so well as in their
estimate of her very trifling merits : and their wonder that their brothers
could in any charms in her.  WWe are kind to her,'' the Misses Osborne
said, a pair of fine black-bowel young ladies who had and the best of
governcsses, masters, and milliners; and they treated her with such
extreme kindness and condescension, and patronises her so insufferably,
that the pcr little thing as in fact perfectly dumb in their presence, and
to all outward appearance as stupid as they thought her. She made
efforts to like the, as in duty bound, and as sisters of her future husband.
She passed ``long mornings'' with them-the most dreary and serious of
forenoons. She drove out solemnly in their great family conch with them,

the ancient concerts by way of a treat, and to the oratorio, and to St.
aul's to see the charity children, where, in such terror was she of her
friends, she almost did not dare be affected by the hymn the children sang.
Their house was comfortable; their papa's table rich and handsome ; their
society solemn and genteel; their self-respect prodigious; they had the
best new at the Foundling; all their habits were pompous and orderly,
and all their amusements intolerable dull and enormous. After every one
of her visits (and OF how glad she was when they recover l) Miss Osborne

sacrifice he was making, and his romantic generosity in throwing himself
away upon amelia, that I 'm not sure but that he really thought he was
one of the most deserving characters in the British army, and gave himself
up to be led with a good deal of easy resignation.
Somehow, although he left ome every morning, as was stated, and
dined abroad six days in the week, when his sister believed the infatuated
youth to be at Miss Selcy's apron-strings: e was not always with Amelia,
whilst the world supposed him at her feet. Certain it is that on or
occasions than one, when Captain Dabbin called to look for his friend,
MIss Osborne (who was very attentive to the Captain, and anxious to hear
his military stories, and to know about the health of his denr MInna),
Miss Osborne would laughingly point to the opposite side of the square,
and say, `` Oh, you must go to the Sedley's to ask for George; ce never
see hein from morning till night.'' At which kind of speech the Captain
would laugh in rather an absurd constrained manner, and turn of the con-
operation, like an consummate menu of the world, to some topic of general
interest, such as the Opera, the l'rince's last ball at Carlton Ilouse, or
the weather-that blessing to society
 What an innocent it is, that act of yours,'' Miss Maria would then
say to Miss Jane, upon the Captain's departure. ` Did you see how he
flushed at the mention of poor George on duty ?''
It's a pity Frederic Bullock hadn't some of his poetry, Maria,''
replies the elder sister, with a loss of her lead.

In your froek, he, hel How would he Can't he landing with
Amelita ?'
The fact is, when Captain Dobbin bushel so, anl looked so awkward,
he remembered a circumstance of which he did not think it was necessary
to inform the young ladies, viz. that he had been calling at MIr. Selley's
house already, on the pretense of seeing George, of course, and George
wasn't there, only poor little Amelia, with rather a sal wistful face, seated
year the drawing-room window, who, after some very trifling stupid talk,
ventured to ask, was there any truth in the report that the regiment was
soon to be ordered abroad; and had Captain Dolbin seen Mr. Osborne
that day 
The regiment was not ordered abroad as yet: ad Captain Dolbin had
not seen George.  He was with his sister, most likely,'' the Capin sail.
` Should he go and fetch the truant?'' So she gave him her land kindly
and gratefully: and he crossed the square; and she waited and waited,
but George never came.
Poor little tender heart and so it goes on hoping and beating, and
longing and trusting. you see it is not much of a life to describe. There is
not much of what you call incident in it. Only one feeling all day-when
will he come? only one thought to sleep and wake upon. I believe George
was playing billiards with Captain Cannon in Swallow Street at the time
when Amelia was asking Captain Dobbin about him; for he was a jolly
sociable fellow, and excellent in all games of skill.

Once, after three days of absence, Miss Amelia put on her bonnet, and
actually invaded the Osborne house. WHat leave our brother to come
to us'' said the young ladies.  Have you had a barrel, Amelia Do

to- to see her dear friends ; they had not met for so long. And this
may she was so perfectly stupid and awkward, that the Miss Laborers
and their governess, who stared after her as she went sadly away, wondered
more than ever what George could see in poor little Amelia.

Of course they did. How was she to bare that timid little heart for
the inspection of those young ladies with their bold black eyes It was
best that it should shrink and hide itself. I know the Miss Osborne
were excellent critics of a Cashmere shawl, or a pink satin slip; and when
MIss Turner had her's died purple, and made into a spencer; and when
MIss Pickford had her ermine tipped twisted into a muff and trimmings.

I warrant you the changes did not escape the two intelligent young
women before mentioned. But there are things, look you, of n fiber
texture than fur or satin, and all Solomon's glories, and all the wardrobe
of the Green of Sheba ;-things whereof the beauty escapes the eyes of
many connoisseur. And there are sweet molest little souls on which you
light, fragrant and blooming tenderly in quiet sandy places; in there
are garden-ornaments, as big s brass warming-pins, that are fit to state
the sun itself out of countenance. Miss Sedley was not of the sun-flower
sort; and I say it is out of the rules of all proportion to draw a violet of
the size of a double dhlia,
No, indeed; the life of a good young girl who is in the paternal nest
as yet, can't have many of those thrilling incidents to which the heroine of
romance commonly lays claim. Snares or shot may take off the old bride
foraging without-hawks may be normal, from which they escape or by
whom they suffer; but the young ones in the nest have a pretty comfortable
romantic sort of existence in the down and the straw, till it comes to
their turn, to, to get on the wing. While BEcky Sharp was on her own
wing in the country, hopping of all sorts of twigs, and amid a multiplicity
of traps, anl pecking up her food quite harmless and successful, Amelia
lay sng in her home of Russell Square; if she went into the world, it was
unhcr the guidance of the elders; nor did it seem that any evil could hofal
her or that opulent cheery comfortable home in which she was affection-
lately sheltered. MIamma had her morning duties, and her daily drive, and
that delightful round of visits and shopping which forms the amusement,
or the profession as you may call it, of the rich London lady. lap con-
ducted his mysterious operations in the city-a stirring place in those
days, when war was raging all over europe, and empires were being
staked; when the `` Courier'' newspaper hull tens of thousands of sub-
scribes; when one day brought you a battle of Vittoria, another a burning
of Moscow, or a newsman's horn blowing down scroll Snare about
dinner-time announced such a fact as-'`little of ILeipsic-six hundred
thousand men engaged-total defeat of the French-two hundred thousand
killed.'' Old Sedley once or twice came home with a very grave face; and
no wonder, when such news as this was agitating all the hearts and all the
Stocks of Europe.
MEanwhile matters went on in Russell Square, Bloomsbury, just as if
matters in europe were not in the least disorgnnised. The retreat from
Leipsic made no difference in the number of meals Mr. Sambo took in the
servant's hall ; the allies poured into France, and the dinner-bell rang at
five o'clock just as usual. Don't think poor Amelia cared anything about
Brienne and Mountrail, or was fairly interested in the war until the
abdication of the Emperor; when she clapped her hands and said prayers,-
oh, how grateful and flung herself into George Osborne's arms with all
her son, to the astonishment of every body who witnessed that ebullition
of sentiment. The fact is, peace was elected, Europe was going to be at
rest; the Corsican was overthrown, and Lieutenant Osborne's regiment
would not be ordered on service. That was the way in which Miss
Anglia reasoned. The fate of Europe was Lieutenant George Osborne to
her. His dangers being over, she sang Te Deum. He was her Europe:

at the MAnsion LoUise, given to the sovereigns, were especially in honour
of George Osborne.
We have talked of shift, selF, and poverty, as those dismal instructors
under whom poor Miss Becky Sharp got her education. Now, love was
Miss Amelia Sedley's last mattress, and it was amazing what progress our
young lady made under that popular teacher. In the course of fifteen
or eighteen months' daily and constant attention to this eminent finishing
governess, what a deal of secrets Amelia lcurunel, which Miss Wirt and the
black-eyed young ladies over the way, which old Miss Pinkerton of Chiswick
herself, had no cognizance of As, indeed, how should any of those prim

of the question: I would not dare to breathe such an idea regarding them.
Miss Maria Osborne, it is true, was ``attached'' to MIr, Frederic Augustus
Bullock, of the firm of Hulker, Bullock, & Bullock; but her's was a most
respectable attachment, and she would have taken pulled sEnior, just the
saine, hcr ind being fixed as that of a well-bred young woman should
be,-upon a house in Park Lane, a country house at Wimbledon, a hand-
some chariot, and two prodigious tall horses and footmen, and a fourth of
the annual profits of the eminent firm of IIulkr & Bullock, nll of which
advantages were represented in the person of Frederic Augustus. Had
orange blossoms been invented then (those touching emblems of female
purity imported by us from FRance, where people's daughters are univer-
sally sold in marriage), Miss MAria, I say, would have assume the spotless
wreath, and stepped into the travelling carriage by the side of gout, old,
and-headed, bottle-nosed Bullock Senior; and devoted hcr beautiful
existence to his happiness with perfect modesty,-only the old gentleman
was married already; so she bestowed hcr young affections on the junior
partner. Scott, blooming, orange flowers the other day i saw Miss

This was not the sort of love that finished nelon's education; and in
the course of n year turned a good young girl into a good young women-
to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come. 1This
young person (perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to encourage
her, and act her in such idolatry an silly romantic ideas) loved, with all
her heart, the young officer in his Majesty's service with whom we have
made a brief uequaintanec. She thought about him the very first moment
on waking; and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers.

While under this overpowering impression, Miss melia neglected her

Miss Satire was too cold for a confidante, and she couldn't bring her mind

hulk little Laura Martin home for the holidays; and my belief is, she
made a confidante of her, and promised that Laura should come and live
with her when she was married, and gave Laura a great deal of informa-
tion regarding the passion of love, which must have been singularly useful
nd novel to the little person. Alas, alas: I far she had not a well-
regulated rid.
What were her parents doing, not to keep this little heart from bonding
so fast Old Sedley did not seem much to notice matters. Ilo was
graver of late, and his City affairs absorbed him. Mars. Sctley was of so
easy and inquisitive a nature, that slc wasn't even jealous. Mr. Jos.
was away, being besieged by an Irish widow at Cheltenham. Aelia hal
the house to herself-hl too nucel to herself sometimes-not that she
ever doubted; for, to bc sure, George must be at the MInors-(funds; and
he can't always get leave from Chatham; and he must see his friends and
sisters, and mingle in society when in town (he such an orient to every
society ) ; and when he is with the regiment, he is too tired to write long
letters. I know where she kept that packet who had-and enn steal in
and out of her chamcr like Iaehimo-like Iahimo? No-that is a bad
part. I will only act Moonshine, and pceep harmless into the bed where
faith and beauty and innocence lie dreaming.
But if Osborne's were short and soldicrlike letters, it must be confessed,
that were MIss Sedley's letters to MIr. Osborne to be published, we should
have to extend this novel to such a multiplicity of volumes as not the most
sentimental reader could support; that she not only filled sheets of large
paper, but crossed them with the most astonishing pervcrsencss; that she
wrote whole pages out of poetry-books without the last pity; that she
underlined words and passages with quite a frantic physics; and, in fine,
gave the usual tokens of her condition. She wasn't a heroine. llc letters
were full of repetition. She wrote rather doubtful german sometimes,
and in her verses took all sorts of liberties with the metre. But oh, mes-

there was that beautiful squadron girl, Miss Pye, at St. Vincent's, you
know; and since he 's been home, they say he's as regular Don Giovanni,
y Jove.''
Stubbles and Spooner thought that to be a ``regular Don Giovanni by
Jove'' was one of the finest qualities a man could possess; and Osborne's
reputation was prodigious amongst the young men of the regiment. He
was famous in field-snorts, famous at a song, famous on parade; free with
his money, which was beautifully supplied by his father. Iis coats were
better made than any man's in the regiment, and he had more of them.
IIe was adored by the men. He could drink more than any officer of the
whole mess, including old IIeasytop, the colonel. He could spar better
than Knuckles, the private (who would have been a corporal but for his
drunkenness, and who had been in the prize-ring); and was the best batter
and bowler, out and out, of the regimental club. IIe rode his own horse,
Greased Lightning, and won the Garrison cup at quebec races. There
were other people besides Amelia who worshipped him. Stubbles and
Spooner thought him a sort of Apollo ; Dobbin took him to be an Admi-
rale Crichton ; and Mrs. MAjor O'Dowd acknowledged he was in elegant
young fellow, and put her in mind of Fitzjurld Fogurty, Lord Castle-
Fogarty's second son.

features regarding this female correspondent of Osborne's,-opining that

it was a Duchess in London, who was in love with him,-or that it was
a General's daughter, who was engaged to somebody else, and mally
attached to him,-or that it was as Member of Parliament's lady, who pro-
posed four horses and an elopement,-or that it was some other victim
of a passion delightfully exciting, romantic, nd disgraceful to nll parties,
on one of which conjectures would Osborne throw the last light,
leaving his young admirers and friends to invent and arrange their whole
story.
And the real state of the case would never have been known at all in the
regiment but for Captain Dobbin's indiscretion. THe Captain was eating
his breakfast one day in the mass-room, while Cackle, the assistant-surgeon,
and the two above-named worthies were speculating upon Osborne's intrigue
-Stubbles holding out that the lady was n Duchess about been Chur-
lotte's court, nnl Cackle vowing she was an opera-singer of the worst
reputation. At this idea Dobbin became so moved, that though his
mouth was full of egg and bread-and-butter at the time, and though he
ought not to have spoken at all, yet he couldn't help blurring out, `` Cnckle,
you're a stupid fool. You 're always talking nonsense and scandal.
Osborne is not going to run off with a Duchess or ruin a milliner. Miss
Sedley s one of the most charming young women that ever lived. He's
been engaged to her ever so long; and the man who calls her names had
better not do so in my hearing.'' With which, turning exceedingly red,
Dobbin ceased speaking, and almost choked himself with cup of tea. The
story was over the regiment in half-an-hour; and that very evening Mrs.
MAjor O'Dowd wrote off to her sister Golovkin at O'bDowdstown not to
urry from Dublin,-young Osborne being prematurely engaged already.
She complimented the Lieutenant in an appropriate speech over a glass
of whisky-today that evening, and he went home perfectly furious to
barrel with Dobbin, (who had declined Mrs. Major O'Down's party, and
set in his own room playing the flute, and, I believe, writing poetry in a
very melancholy manner)-to quarrel with Dobbin for betraying his secret.
 Who the deuce asked you to talk about my affairs,'' Osborne shouted
iudignantly. ``Why the devil is all the regiment to know that I am going
to be married Why is that battling old harriman, Peggy O'Dowd, to
make free with my name over her d-d supper-table, and advertise my
engagement over the three kingdoms After all, what right have you to
say i am engaged, or to meddle in my business at all, Dolbin 2''
It seems to e,''- Captain Dobbin began.
`Seems be hanged, Dobbin,'' his junior interrupted him. :I am
under obligations to you, I know it, a d-d deal too well too; but I won't
be always sermonised by you because you're five years my senior. I'm
hanged if I 'll stand your airs of superiority and infernal pity and patron-
ge. Pity and patronage I should like to know in what I'm your
interior  '
`Are you engaged'' Captain Dobbin interposed.

`` Are you ashamed fit'' )obbin resumed.
 What right have you to ask me that question, sir I should like to
kn:of,'' George suid.

vANITY FAIR.
Good Gol, you don't mean to say you want to break off'' asked
Dobbin, starting up.
``In other words, you ask me if I 'm a man of honour,'' said Osborne,
fiercely ; `` is that what you mean You've adopted such a tone regarding
me lately that I 'm - if I'll bear it any more.''
e WHat have I done I 've told you you were neglecting a sweet girl,
George. I 've told you that when you go to town you ought to go to her,
and not to the gambling-houses about St. James's.''
You want your money back, I suppose,'' said George, with a sneer.
Of course 1do-I always did, didn't I'' says Dobbin.  ou speak
like s generous fellow,''
No, and it, William, I beg your pardon''-here George interposed
in a fit of remorse; ``you Have been my friend in a hundred ways,
Haven knows. you've got me out of a score of scrapes. WHich
Crawley of the Guards won that s of money of me I should have been
one but for you: I know I should. bUt you wouldn't deal so hardly
with me; you shouldn't be always catechizing me. I am very fond of
Amelia; I adore her, and that sort of thing. Don't look angry. Sle's,
faultless; I know she is. But you see there's no fun in winning a thing
less you play for it. LIang it: the regiment's just back from the West
Indies, I must have a little thing, and then when I'm married I 'll reform;
I will upon my honour, now. And-I say-Dob-don't be angry with
me, and I'll give you a hundred next mouth, when I know my father will
stand something handsome; and I'll nsk llearytop for leave, and I 'll go
to town, and see Amelia to-morrow-there now, will that satisfy you''
 It's impossible to be long angry with you, George,'' said the good-
natured Captain; ``and as for the money, old of, you know if I wanted
it you'd share your last shilling with me.''
That I would, by Jvc, obbin,'' George said, with the greatest gene-
rosity, though by the way he never had any money to sparc.
`Only I wish you had sown those wild oats of yours, George. If you
could use seen poor little MIss Emmy's face when she asked me about
you the other day, you would have pitched those billiard-balls to the deuce.
Go and comfort hcr, you rascal. Go and write her a long letter. dO
something to make her happy: a very little will.''
I believe she's d-d font of me,'' the Lieutenant said, with a self-
satisfied air; and went off to finish the evening with some jolly follows in
the mess-room.
Amelia meanwhile, in RusscllSquare, was looking at the moon, which was
shining upon that peaceful spot, as well as upon thc square of the Chatham
barracks, were Lieutenant Osborne was quartered, and thinking to her-
self low ler lero was employed. Perhaps he is visiting the sentries,
thought she; perhaps he is bivouacking; perhaps he is attending the
couch of a wounded comrade, or studying the art of war up in his own de-
isolate chamber. and ler kind thoughts sped away as if they were angels
and had wings, and flying down the river to Chatham and Rochester, stove
to deep into the barracks whocre George was.
All things considered, I think it was as well the gates were shut, and
tlc scntry allowed no one to pass; so that the poor little white-robes angel

could not hear the songs those young fellows were roaring over the whiskey-
punch.
The day after the little conversation at Chatham barracks, young
Osborne, to show that he would be as good as his word, prepared to go
to town, thereby incurring Captain Dobbin's applause. `I should have
liked to make her a little present,'' Osborne said to his friend in confi-
dence, ``one I am quite out of cash until my father tips up.'' But
Dobbin would not allow this good nature and generosity to be balked, and
. so accommodated Mr. Osborne with a few pound notes, which the latter
took after a little faint seruple.
And I dare say he would have bought something very handsome for
Amelia; only, getting off the coach in Fleet Street, he was attracted by a
handsome shirt-in in a jeweller's window, which he could not resist; and
having paid for that, had very little money to spare for indulging in any
further exercise of kindness. Never mind: you may be sure it is not his
presents Amelia wanted. When he came to Russell Square, her face
sighted up as if he had been sunshine. The little cares, fears, tears, timid
misgivings, sleepless fancies of I don't know how many days and nights,
were forgotten, under one moment's influence of that familiar, irresistible

smile. He leaned on her from the drawing-room door-magnificent,
with ambrosia whiskers, like a god. Sambo, whose face as he announced
Captain Osbin (having conferred a brevet rank on that young officer)
bleed with a sympathetic grin, saw the little girl start, and lush, and
imp up from her watching-place in the window; and Snmbo retreated:
and as soon as the door was shut, she went fluttering to Lieutenant George
Osborne's heart as if it was the only natural home for her to nestle in.
Oh, thou poor panting little soul The very finest true in the whole
forest, with the straighten stem, and the strongest arms, and the thickest
foliage, wherein you choose to build and coo, may be marked, for what
you know, and may be down with a crash are long. WHat in old, old
simile that is, between man and timber l
In the meanwhile, george kissed her very kindly on her forehead and
glistening eyes, and was very gracious and good; and she thought Iis
diamond shirt-pin (which she had not known him to wear before) the pre-
test ornament ever seen.
The observant reader, who has marked our young Lieutenant's previous
behaviour, and has preserved our report of the brief conversation which he
has just had with Captain Dobbin, hus possibly come to certain colour-
sions regarding the character of Mr. Osborne. Some cynical Frenchman
has said that there are two parties to a love-transaction: the one who loves
and the other who condescended to be so treated. Perhaps the low is
occasionally on the man's side: perhaps on the lady's. Perhaps some
infatuated swain has ere this mistaken sensibility for modesty, dullness
for maiden-reserve, mere vacuity for sweet bashfulness, and a goose, in n
word, for a swan. Perhaps some beloved female subscriber has arrayed an
as in the splendour and glory of her imagination ; admired his dullness
as manly simplicity; worshipped his selfishness ns manly superiority;
treated his stupidity as majestic gravity, and used him as the brilliant
fairy Titania in a certain weaver of Athens. I think I have seen such
comedies of errors going on in the world. But this is certain, that Amelia
believe her over to be one of the most gallant and brilliant men in the
empire: and it is possible Lieutenant Osborne thought so too.
He was a little will: how many young men are; and do't girls like
a rake better than a milksop He hadn't sown his wild oats as yet, but
he would soon: and quit the army, now that peace was proclaimed; the
Corsican monster locked up at Elba; promotion by consequence over; and
no chance left for the display of his undoubted military talents anl valour:
and his allowance, with AMerican's settlement, would enable them to take a
snug place in the country somewhere, in a good sporting neighbourhood;
nl he would hunt a little, and farm n little; nl they would be very
happy. As for remaining in the army as a married man, that was impose-
bible. Funny Mrs. George Osborne iu lodgings in a country town;
or, worse still, in the East or West Indies, with a society of soldiers,
and patronized by MIrs. Major O'Dowd: Amelia diel with laughing at
Osborne's stories about MIrs. Major O'Down. IIe joel her much to
fondly to subject hcr to the horrid woman and her vulgaritics, and the
rough treatment of a soldier's will. 1le didn't care for himself-not he;

A NOEL WITHOUT A HERO.
109
but his dear little girl should take the place in society to which as his wife
she was entitled: and to these proposals you may be sure she acceded, as
she would to any other from the same author.
Holding this kind of operation, and building numberless castles in
the air (which Amelia adorned with all sorts of flower-gardens, rustic
walks, country churches, sunday schools, and the like; while George had
his mind's eye directed to the stables, the kennel, and the cellar), this
young pair passed away a couple of hours very pleasantly; and as the
Lieutenant and only that single day in town, and a great deal of most
important business to transact, it was proposed that Miss Emmy should
line with her future sisters-in-law. This invitation was accepted joyfully.
Ie conducted her to his sisters; where he left hcr talking and rattling in
a way that astonished those ladies, who thought that George might make
something of her; and then went off to transact his business.
In a word, hewent ou and at is at a pastry-cook's shop in Charing
Cross; trieraew coat in-Pall Mall; dropped in at the Old 9lighters',
and called.for Captain Cannot played cleven games at billiards with the
Captain, of which he won eight,and returned to Russell Square half-an-
hour late for dinner, but in very good humour.
It was not so with old Mr. Osborne. Wen that gentleman came from
the city, and was welcomed in the drawing-room by his daughters and the
elegant Miss Wirt, they saw at once 'by his face-which was puffy, solemn,
nd yellow at the best of times-and by the cowl and twitching of his
black eye-brows, that the heart within his large white wuistcoat was
disturbed and uneasy.  When Amelia stepped forward to salute him,
which she' always did with great trembling and timidity, he gaven
surly grunt of recognition, and dropped the little hand out of his great
hirsute paw without any attempt: to hold it there. Ile looked round
gloomily at his eldest daughter; who, comprehending thc meaning of his
look, which asked unmistakeahly,  Why the devil is ale here ?'' said at
0nCe:-
 George is in town, Papa; and has gone to the Horse Guards, and
will be back to dinner,''
O he is, is her I won't hare the dinner kept waiting for linn,
Jane :'' with which this worthy man lapsed into his particular chair, and
then the utter silence in his genteel, well-furnished drawing-room, was
only interrupted by the alarmed ticking of the great French clock.
When that chronometer, which was surmounted by a cheerful brass
round of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, tolled five in a hey cathedral tone,
Mr. Osborne pulled the bell at his right hand violently, and the butler
rushed up.
 Dinner'' roared Mr. Osborne.
eMr. George isn't come in, sir,'' interposed the man.
Damn Mr. George, sir. Am I master of the house DrEnI''
Mr. Osborne showed. Amelia trembled. A telegraphic communication
of eyes passed between the other three ladies. The obedient bell in to
lower regions began ringing the announcement of the men. The tolling
over, the head of the family thrust his hands into the great tail-pockets of
110

his great blue coat and brass buttons, an without waiting for a further
announcement, strode down stairs alone, scowling over his shoulder at the
four females.
 What 's the matter now, my dear ?'' asked one of the other, as they
rose and tripped gingerly behind the sire.
I suppose the funds are falling,'' whispered Miss Wirt; and so,
trembling and in silence, this hushed female company followed their dark
leader. They took their places in silence. e growled out a blessing,
which sounded as guilty as a curse. The great silver dish-covers were
removed. Amelia tremblel in her place, for she was next to the awful
Osborne, and alone on her side of the table,-the gap eug occasioned by
the absence of George.
Soup'' sys Mr. Oborne, clutching the idle, firing his eyes on her,
in a sepulchral tone; and having helped her and the rest, did not speak for
a while.
 Take Miss Sedley's plate away,'' at Inst he said. :She can't eat the
soup-no more can I. It's beastly. Take away the soup, STicks, and
to-morrow turn the cook out of the house, Jane,''
Ning concluded his observations upon the soup, MIr Osborne made a
few curt remarks respecting the fish, also of a savage and satirical ten-
deny, and cursed Billingsgate with an emphasis quito worthy of the
place. Then,he lapsed into silence, and swallowed sundry glasses of wine,
looking more and more terrible, till a brisk knock at the door told of
George's arrival, when everybody began to rally.
He could not come before. General Daguilet had kept him waiting at
the Horse Guards. Never mind soup or fish. Give him anything-he
didn't care what. Capital mutton-capital everything.'' His good-
humour contrasted with his father's severity; and he rattled on unless-
singly during dinner, to the delight of all-of one especially, who need not
be mentioned.
As soon as the young ladies had discussed the orange and the glass of
wine which formed the ordinary conclusion of the dismal banquets at Mr.
Osborne's house, the signal to make sail for the drawing-room was given,
and they all arose and departed. Aelia hoped George would soon join
them there. She began playing some of his favourite waltzcs (then newly
imported) at the great carved-legged, leather-cased grand piano in the
drawing-room overhead. This little artifice did not bring him. Ie was
deaf to the waltzes; they grew fainter and fainter ; the discomfited per-
former left the huge instrument presently; and though her three friends
performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new pieces of their rear-
tire, she did not hear a single note, but sate thinking, nnl boeing evil.
Oll Osborne's scowl, terrified always, had never before looked so deadly to
her. IIis eyes followed her one of the room, as if she had been guilty of
something. WHen they brought her coffee, she started as though it were
a cup of poison which Mr. Iieks, the butler, wished to propose to her. What
mystery was there lurking? Oh those women They nurse and cuddle
their presentiments, and make darlings of their ugliest thoughts, as they do
of their deformed children.
The gloom on the paternal countenance had also impressed George

Osborne with anxiety. With such eyebrows, and a look so decidedly
bilious, how was he to extract that one from the governor, of which
George was consumnedly in want Ile began praising his father's wine.
That was generally a successful means of cajoling the old gentleman.
We never got such Madeira in the West Indies, sir, as yours. Colonel
lIeavytop took off three bottles of that you sent me dow, under his belt
the other day.''
Dil he:'' said the old gentleman. `'It stands me in eight killings
a bottle,''
 Will you take six guineas a dozen for it, sir'' said George, with
laugh. : There 's one of the greatest men in the kingdom wants some.''
Does he:'' growled the senior.  With he may get it.''
WHen General gilbert was at Chatham, sir, Ileavytop gave lim n
breakfast, and asked me for some of the wine. The General like it just
as well-wanted s pipe for the Commander-in-Chief. IIe's his loyal
hIghness's right-hand man.''
It is devilish fine wine,'' said the Eyebrows, and tlc looked ore
good-mounted; and George was going to take advantage of this com-
placencey, and bring the supply question on the mahogany; when the
father, relapsing into solemnity, though rather cordial in manner, bale him
ring the bell for claret. ``And we 'll see if tut 's as good as the Madeira,
George, to which his Royal IIighmness is welcome, l 'm sure. And ns wc
are drinking it, I'll talk to you about a matter of importance.''
Amelia heard the claret bell ringing as she set nervously u-stairs. She
thought, somehow, it was a mysterious and prcsentimental bill. Of the
presentiments which some people are always having, some surely must
come right.
 What I want to know, George,'' the old gentleman said, after lowly
smacking his first bumper.  What I nut to know is, how you and-
as-that little thing up-stirs, aure carrying on''
I think, sir, it 's not hard to see,'' george said, with a self-satisfied
grin.  Pretty clear, sir.-What capital wine''
 WHat d' you mean, pretty clear, sir''
 Why, hangit, sir, don't push me too hard. I 'm a molest man. I-
as-I don't set up to be a lady-killer; but I do own that she 's as devilish
fond of me as she can be. Any body can see that will half an eye.''
``And you yourself2''
 Why, sir, didn't you order me to marry her, nnl ain't IN a good boy '
Ian't our Papas settled it over so long''
`A pretty boy, indeed. INvent't I heard of your doings, sir, with
Lord Tarquin, Captain Crawley of the Guards, the Honorable Mr., Deceased
and that set. Have a care, sir, have a care.''
The old gentleman pronounced these aristocratic games with the
greatest gusto. Whenever he met a great man he grovclled before him,
and m-loaded him as only a free-boru Briton can do. HIDe came home
and looked out his history in the Peerage: he introduced his name into his
daily conversation; he bragged about his Lordship to his daughter. He
fell down prostrate and basked in him as a Neapolitan beggar does in the
sun. George was alarmed when he heard the names. IIe feared his

father might have been informed of certain transactions at play. But the
old moralist cased him by saying serenely,
 Well, well, young men will be young men. And the comfort to me
is, income, that living in the best society in England, as I hope you do;
is I think you do; as my means will allow you to to-''
 Thank you, sir,'' says George, making his point at once. ' One can't
live with these great folks for nothing; and my purse, sir, look at it;''
and he held up a little token which had been netted by Amelia, and con-
taking the very last of Dobbin's pound notes.
 You shan't want, sir. The British merchant's son shan't want, sir.
My guineas are as good as theirs George, my boy; and I dont grudge
'em. Call on Mr. Chopper as you go through the City to-morrow; he'll
have something for you. I dont grudge money when I know you 're in
good society, because I know that good society can never go wrong.
There's no pride in me. I was a humbly born man-but you have had
uivntages. Make a good use of 'cm. Mix with the young nobility.
There's many of 'em who can't spend a dollar to your guinea, my boy.
And as for the pink bonnets (here from under the heavy eyebrows there
came a knowing and not by pressing ler)--why leys will be boys
Only there's one thing I order you to avoid, which, if you do not, 1'll
cut you off with a shilling, by Joe; and that's gambling, sir.''
`Oh, of course, sir,'' said George.
But to return to the other business about Amelia: why shouldn't you
carry higher than a stockbroker's daughter, George-that's what I want
to know 
 It 's a family business, sir,'' says George, cracking filberts. `You and
MIr. Sedley made the match a hundred years ago,''
I don't deny it; but people's positions alter, sir. I don't deny that
Sedley made my fortune, or rather put me in the way of acquiring, by y
own talents and genius, that proud position, which, I my say, I occupy in
the tallow trade and the City of London. I've shown my gratitude to
Selley; and he's tried it of late, sir, as my check-book can show.
George I tell you in confidence I don't like the looks of Ir. Seclley's
aWards. My chief clerk, Mr. Chopper, does not like the looks of 'cem, and
he's an old file, and knows Change as well as any man in London.
IIulkcr and Bullock ure looking shy at im. He's been dabbling on his
own account I fear. `They say the Jeune Amelie was his, which was taken
by the Yankee Privateer Molasses. And that 's flat,-unless I see Amelia's
ten thousand down you don't marry her. I'll have no name duck's
daughter in my family. Pass the wine, sir-or ring for coffee.''
WIth which Mr. Osborne spread out the evening-pcr, and George
knew from this signal that the colloquy was ended, and that his apa was
about to take a nap.
ICe hurried up stairs to Amelia in the highest spirits. WHat was it
that made him more attentive to her on that night than he had been for a
long time-more eager to amuse her, more tender, more brilliant in talk?
WVus it that his generous heart warmed to her at the prospect of minor-
tune; or that the idea of losing the dear little prize made him value it more

afterwards, remembering his words; his looks ; the song he sang; his
attitude, as he leant oer her or looked at her from a distance. As it
seemed to her, no night ever passed as quickly at Mr. Osborne's house
before; and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry
by the premature arrival of Mr. Sambo with her shawl.
George came and took a tender leave of her the next morning: and
then hurried off to the City, where he visited Mr. Chopper, his father's
head man, and received from that gentleman a document which he ex-
changed at Hulker's and Bullock's for a whole pocket-full of money. As
George entered the house, old John Sedley ws passing out of the banker's

MIsS CRAWLEY AT IODINE.
[
BUT this time there rove up to an
exceedingly snug and well appointed
house in Park Lane, a travelling chariot
with a lozenge on the panels, a dis-
contented female in a green veil and
crimped curls on the rumble, and a
large and confidential man on the box.
It was the equipage of our friend Miss
Crawley, returning from Hants. The
windows of the carriage were set;
the fat spaniel, whose head and tongue
ordinarily rolled out of one of them,
reposed on the lap of the discontented
female. WHen the vehicle stopped, a large round bundle of shawls was taken
out of the carriage by the aid of various domestic and a young lady who
accompanied the cap of cloaks. That bundle contained Miss Crawley,
who was conveyed up-stairs forthwith, and put into a bed and chamber
warmed properly as for the reception of an invalid. Messengers went off
for her physician and medical man. They came, consulted, prescribed,
vanished. The yog companion of Miss Crawley, at the conclusion of
their interview, came in to receive their instructions, and administered
those antiphlogistic medicines which the eminent men ordered.
Captain Crawley of tlc Life Guards rode up from Knightsbridge Bar-
ranks the next day: his black charger paved the straw before his invalid
hunt's door. IIe was most affectionate in his inquiries regarding that
amiable relative. There seemed to be much source of apprehension. IIe
found Miss Crawley's mid (the discontented female) unusually sulky and
despondent : he found Miss Briggs her dame dc compagnie in tears alone in
the drawing-room. She had hastened home, caring of her beloved friend's
illness. She wished to fly to her couch, that couch which she, Briggs, had
so often smoothed in the hour of sickness. She was denied admission to
Miss Crawley's apartment. A stranger was administering her medicines

IIere these two talked for ten minutes, discussing, no doubt, the smp-
toms of the old invalid above stairs; at the end of which period the
parlour-bell was rung briskly, and answered on that instant by Mr. Bowls,
Miss Crawley's large confidential butler (who, indeed, happened to be at
the keyhole during the most part of the interview); and the Captain coming
out, curling his moustachios, mounted the black charger swing among
the straw to the admiration of the little blackguard boys collected in the
street. Ie looked in at the dining-room window, managing his horse,
which corvette and chapter beautifully-for one instant the young person
might be seen at the window, then her figure vanished, and, doubtless, she
went-up stairs again to resume the affecting duties of benevolence.
Who could this young woman be, I wonder That evening a little
winner for to persons was laid in the dining-room-when Mrs. Firkin,
the lady's said, pushed into her mistress's apartment, and bustle about
acre during the vacancy occasioned by the departure of the new nurse-
and the latter and Miss Briggs sat down to theatre little meal.
Briggs was so much choked by emotion that she could hardly the n
morsel of ment. The young person carved n for with the utmost
delicacy, and asked so distinctly for egg-sauce, that poor Briggs, before
whom that delicious condiment was placed, started, made a great clatter-
in with the ladle, and once more fell back in the most gusting hysterical
state.
Hal you not better give Miss Briggs a glass of wine2'' and the
person to Mr. Bowls, the large confidential man. IIe did so. Briggs
seized it mechanically, gaspet it down conclusively, moaned a little, and
began to play with the chicken on her plate.
t I think we shall be able to help each other,'' said the person with
reat suavity: ``and shall have no ncedl of Mr. Bols's kind services.
MIr. Bowls, if you please, we will ring when we want you.'' He went
don stairs, where, by the way, he vented the most horrid curses upon
the offending footman, his subordinate.
It is a pity you take on so, Miss Briggs,'' the young lady said, with
cool, slightly sarcastic, air.
 My dearest friend is so ill, and to-o-o-on't see me,'' gurglcd
out Briggs in an agony of renewed grief.
She's not very ill any more. Console yourself, lens MIss Briggs.
She has only overseen herself-that is all. She is greatly better. he
will soon be quite restored again. She is week from being cuppcd and
from medical treatment, but she will rally immediately. Prey console
yourself, and take a little more wino.''
e ut why, why won't she see me again?'' Miss Briggs blcnted out
Oh, Matilda, Matilda, after three-and-twenty years' tenderness is this
the return to your poor, poor Arabella?''
Don't cry too much, poor Arabella,'' the other said (with ever so
little of a grin);'' she only won't see you, because she says you don't nurse
her as well as I do. It's no pleasure to me to sit up all night. I wish
you might do it instead.''
 HAve I not tended that ear couch for years:'' Arabella said, `` and

 Now she prefers somebody else. Well, sick people have these fancies,
and must be humoured. When she's well I shall go.''
nEver, never,'' Arabella exclaimed, madly inhaling her salts-bottle. .-
Never be well or never go? Miss Briggs,'' the other said, with the
same provoking good nature. ``Pooh-she will be well in a fortnight,
when I shall go back to a little pupils at Queen's Crawley, and to their
mother, who is a great deal more sick than our friend. ou need not be
jealous about me, my dear Miss Briggs. I am a poor little girl without
any friends, or any harm in me. I don't want to supplant you in Miss
Crawley's good graces. Sle will forget me a week after I am gone: and
her affection for you has been the work of years. Give me a little win
if you please, my dear Miss Briggs, and let us be friends. I 'm sure I
want friends.''
The playable nd soft-hearted Briggs speechless pushed out her hand
at this appeal; but she felt the desertion most keenly for all that, and
bitterly, bitterly moanel the fickleness of her Matilda. At the end of
half an hour, the meal over, Miss Rebecca Sharp (for such, astonishing to
state, is the name of her who has been described ingeniously as the person
hitherto), went up-stairs again to her patient's rooms, from which, with
the most engaging politeness, she eliminated poor Firkin.  Thank you,
Mrs. Firkin, that will quite do: how nicely you make it1 I will ring
when anything is wanted.''  Thank you;'' and Firkin came down stairs
in a tempest of jealousy, only the more dangerous because she was forced
to confine it in her own bosom.
Could it be the tempest which, as she passed the landing of the first
floor, blew open the drawing-room door No; it was stealthily opened
by the hand of Briggs. Briggs had been on the watch. Briggs too well
heard the ereking Firkin descend the stairs, and the link of the spoon
and gruel-basin the neglected female carried.

A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
I
Rebecca passel that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawley; the
next night the old lady slept so comfortably, that Rebecca had time for
several hours' comfortable repose herself on the sofa, at the foot of her
patroness's bed; very soon, Miss Crawley was so well that she sat up
and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Briggs and ler grill,
which REbecca described to her. briggs' weeping affleck, and her manner
of using the handkerchief, were so completely rendered, that Miss Crawley
eca quite cheerful, to the admiration of the doctors when they visited
her, who usually found this worthy woman of the world, when the least
sickness attacked her, under the most abject depression and terror of death.
Captain Crowley came every day, and received bulletins from Miss
Rebecca respecting his aunt's health. This improved so rapidly, that
poor bRiggs was allowed to see her patronuess; and persons with tender
hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female,
and the affecting nature of the interview.
Miss Crawley liked to have Briggs in a good deal soon. Rebecca used
to miic her to her face with the most admirable gravity, thereby ren-
during the imitation doubly picunnte to her worthy patroness.
The causes which had led to the deplorable illness of Miss Crawley, and
her departure from her brother's house in the country, were of such an
romantic nature tat they are hardly fit to be explained in this genteel
and sentimental novel. For how is it possible to hint of n delicate female,
living in good society, that she ate and drank too much, and that s hot
supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the ectory was the reason of an
disposition which Miss Crawley herself persisted ws solely attributable
to the dampness of the weather? The attack was so sharp the Matilda-
ns his Reverence expressed it-is very nearly `` off the hooks;'' all the
family was in a fever of expectation regarding the will, and Rawdon
Crawley was making sure of at least forty thousand pounds before the
commencement of the London season. Mr, Crawley sent over a choice
parcel of tracts, to prepare her for the change from Vanity Fair and Park
Lane for another world; but a good doctor from Southampton being
called in in time, vanquished the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her,
nude gave her sufficient strength to enable her to return to London. The
barouet did not disguise his exceeding mortification at the turn which
affairs took.
While everybody was attending on Miss Crawley, and messengers every
hour from the elector were carrying news of her health to the inflectional
folks there, there was a lady in another part of the house, being exceedingly
ill, of whom no one took any notice at all; and this was the lady of
Crowley herself. The good doctor shook his heal after seeing her; to
which visit Sir Pitt consented, as it would be paid without a fee; and she
was left. fading away in her lonely chamber, with no more heed paid to her
then to n weed in the park.
The young ladies, too, lost much of the estimable benefit of their
governess's instruction. So affectionate n nurse was Miss Sharp, that
Miss Crawley would take her medicines from no other hand. Firkin had
been deposed long before her mistress's departure from the country. ThaI

Faithful attendant found a gloomy consolation on returning to London, in
seeing Miss briggs suffer the same pangs of jealousy and undergo the same
fithless treatment to which she herself and been subject.
Captain Rawdon got an extension of leave on his aunt's illness, and
remained dutifully at home. It was always in her antichamber. (She lay
sick in the state bed-room, into which you entered by the little blue saloon).
His father was always meeting him there; or if he came down the corridor
ever so quietly, his father's door was sure to open, and the liana face of
the old gentleman to glare out. What was it set one to watch the other
so P A generous rivalry, no doubt, as to which should be most attentive
to the dear suferer in the state bed-room. Rebecca used to come out
and comfort both of them; or one of the other of them rather. Both of
these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to have news of the invalid
from her little confidential messenger.
At dinner-to which meal she descended for half an hour-she kept the
peace between them: after which she disappeared for the night; when
Rawdon would ride over to the de0t of the 150th at Mulbury, leaving
his Papa to the society of Mr, Horrocks and his rum and water. She
passed as weary n fortnight as ever mortal spent in Miss Crawley's sick
room; but her little nerves seemed to be of iron, and she was quite
unshaken by the duty and the tedium of the sick-chamber.
She never told until long afterwards how painful that duty was; how
peevish a patient was the jovial old lady ; how angry; how sleepless; in
what horrors of death; during what long nights she lay moaning, and in
almost delirious agonies respecting that future world which she quite
ignored when she was in good health,-Picture to yourself, oh fair young
reader, a worldly, selfish, graceless, thaukless, religionless old woman,
writing in pain and fear, and without her wig. Picture her to yourself,
and are you be old, learn to love and pray
Sharp watched this graeeless bedside with indomitable patience. Nothing
escaped her; and, like a prudent steward, she found a use for everything.
She told many a good story about Miss Crawley's illness in after days,-
stories which made the lady blush through her artificial carnations. During
the illness she was never out of temper; always alert; she slept light,
having a perfectly clear conscience; and could take that refreshment at
almost any minute's warning. And so you saw few traces of fatigue in
her appearance. Her face might be a trifle per, and the circles round
her eyes a little blacker than usual; but whenever she came out from the
sick-room she was always smiling, fresh, and neat, and looked as trim in
her little dressing-gown and cap, as in her smartest evening suit.
The Captain thought to, and raved about her in uncouth convulsions.
The barbed shaft of love and penetrated his dull hide. Six weeks-approx-
inquiry-opportunity-had victimised him completely. He made a con-
finite of his aunt nt the Rectory, of all persons in the world. She rallied
him about it; she had perceived his folly ; she warned him; she finished
by owning that little Sharp was the most clever, droll, odd, good-natured,
simple, kindly creature in England. Rawdon must not triple with her
affection, though-denr Miss Crawley would never pardon him for that;
for she, too, was quite overcome by the little governess, and loved Sharp

like a daughter. Rawdon must go away-go back to his regiment and
naughty London, and not play with a poor articles girl's feelings.
MIndy and many time this good-natured ludy, compassionating the for-
iron life-guardsman's condition, gave him an opportunity of seeing Miss
Sharp at the Rectory, and of walking home with her, as we have seen.
WHen men of a certain sort, ladies, are in love, though they see the hook
and the string, and the whole apparatus with which they are to be take,
they gorge the bait nevertheless-they must come to it-they must swallow
it-and are presently struck and landed gasping. lawson saw there was
a manifest intention on Mrs. But's part to captivate him with Ilcbecca.
He was not very wise; but he was a man about town, and had seen

through a speech of Mrs Bute's.

 You men perceive nothing. ou silly, blind creature-if anything
happens to Lady Crawley, Miss Sharp will be your mother-in-law; and
that 's what will happen.''
Along Crawley, Esquire, gae vent to a prodigious whistle, in token of
astonishment at this announcement. He couldn't deny it. IIis father's
evident liking for Miss Sharp had not escaped him. IIe know the old
gentleman's character well; and a more unscrupulous old-who-he did
not conclude the sentence, but walked home, curling his mustachioed, and

When he saw Rebecca alone, he rallied her about his father's attachment
in his graceful way. She flung up her heal seornfully, looked lim full in

she spoke with ever so slight a foreign accent, which gave great charm to
her clear ringing voice. ` No,'' she continued, kindling as she spoke to
the Captain; ``l can endure poverty, but not shame-neglect, but not
insult; and insult from-from you.''
Her feelings gave way, and she burst into tears.
` Hang it, Miss Sharp-rebecca-by Jove-upon my soul, I wouldn't

She was gone. She drove out with Miss Crawley that dy. It was
before the latter's illness. At dinner she was unusually brilliant and
lively; but she would take no notice of the hints, or the gods, or the
clumsy expostulations of the humiliated, infatuated guardsman. Skin-
wishes of this sort passed perpetually during the little campaign-tedious
to relate, and similar in result. The Crawley heavy cavalry was maddened
by defeat, and routed every day.
The baronet of queen's Crawley had not had the fear of losing his sister's
legacy before his eyes, he never would have permitted his dear girls to
lose the educational blessings which their invaluable governess was con-
fearing upon them. The old house at home seemed n desert without her,
so useful and pleasant had Rebecca made herself there. Sir Pitt's letters
were not copied and corrected; his books not made up; his household
business and manifold schemes neglected, now that his little secretary was
away. And it was easy to see how necessary such an amanuensis was to
him, by the tenor nnl spelling of the numerous letters which he sent to
her, treating her and commanding her to return. Almost every day
brought n frank from the baronet, enclosing the most urgent prayers to
Becky for her return, or conveying pathetic statements to Miss Crawley,
regarding the neglected state of his daughters' education; of which docu-
ments Miss Crawley took very little heed.
Miss bRiggs was not formally dismissed, but her place as companion
was a sinecure and a decision ; and her company was the fat spaniel in the
drawing-room, or occasionally the discontented Firkin in the housekeeper's
closet. Nor, though the old ludy would by no means hear of Rebecca's
departure, was the latter regularly installed in altice in Park Lane. Like
many wealthy people, it s Miss Crawley's habit to accept as much
service and she could get from her inferiors; and good-naturedly to tanke
lace of them when she no longer found them useful. Gratitude amongst
certain rich folks ie scarcely natural or to be thought of. They take
needy people's services as their due. Nor have you, O poor parasite and
humble hanger-on, much reason to complain! our friendship for Dives
is about as sincere as the return which it usually gets. It is money
you love, and not the man; and were Crests and his footman to change
places, you know, you poor rogue, who would love the benefit of your
allegiance.
And I am not sure, that, in spite of Rebecca's simplicity and activity,
and gentleness anl hunting good humour, the shrewd oll London lady,
upon whom these treasures of friendship were lavished, had not a lurking
suspicion all the while of ler affectionate pure and friend. It must he
often crossed Miss Crawley's mind that nobody does anything for nothing.

If she measured her own feeling towards the world, she must hne been
pretty well able to gauge those of the world towards herself; and perhaps
she reflected, that it is the ordinary lot of people to have no friends if they
themselves care for nobody.
Well, meanwhile Becky was the greatest comfort and convenience to
her, and she gave her a couple of new gowns, and an old necklace asd
shawl, and showed her friendship by abusing all her intimate acquaintances
to her new confidante (than which there can't be a more touching proof of
regard), and meditated vaguely some great future benefit-to marry her
perhaps to Clump, the apothecary, or to settle her in some advantageous
way of life; or, at any rate, to send her back to Queen's Crawley when she
had done with her, and the full London season had begun.
When Miss Crawley was convalescent and descended to the drawing-
room, Becky sang to her, and otherwise amused her; when she was
well enough to drive out, bEcky accompanied her. And amongst the
drives which they took, whither, of all places in the world, did Miss
Crawley's admirable good-nature and friendship actually induce her to
penetrate, but to Russell Square, Bloomsbury, and the house of Joh
edley, Esquire.
Ere that event, many notes had passed, as may be imagined, between
the two dear friends. During the months of rebecca's stay in Hampshire,
the eternal friendship lad (must it be owned) suffered considerable
diminution, and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to threaten
demise altogether. The fact is, both girls had their own real affairs to
think of: rebecca her advance with her employers-Amelia her of
absorbing topic. When the two girls met, and flew into each other's and
with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of young ladies
towards each other, Rebecca performed her part of the embrace with the
most perfect briskness and energy. Poor little Amelia brushed as she
kissed her friend, and thought she had been guilty of something very like
coldness towards her.
Their first interview was but a very short one. Amelia was just ready
to go out for a walk. Miss Crawley was writing in her carriage below,
her people wondering at the locality in which they found themselves, and
gaming upon honest Sambo, the black footman of Bloomsbury, as one of
the queer natives of the plane. But when Amelia came down with her
kind smiling looks (rebecca must introduce her to her friend, Miss Crawley
was longing to see her, and was too ill to leave her carriage)-when, I sa,
Amelia came down, the Park One shoulder-knot aristocracy wondered
more and more that such a thing could come out of Bloomsbury; and
MIss Crawley was fairly captivated by the sweet blushing face of the young
lady who came forward so vividly and so gracefully to pay her respects to
the protector of her friend.
What a complexion, my der. What a sweet voice'' Miss Crawley
said, as they drove away westward after the little interview. ``My car

rapture half-a-dozen times that day. She mentioned her to Rawdon
Crowley, who came lutifully to partake of his aunt's chicken.
Of course, on this Rebecca instantly stated, that Amelia was engaged to
be married-to a Lieutenant Osborne-a very old flame.
Is he a man in a line-regiment'' Captain Crawley asked, remember-

Rebecca thought that was the regiment. The Captain's name,'' she
said, ``was Captain Dolbin.''
`A lanky,gawky fellow,''said Crawley, ``tumbles over everybody. I know
him; and Osborne's a goods-looking fellow, with large black whiskers''
enormous,'' Miss rebecca Sharp said, ``and enormously proud of
them, I assure you.''
Captain kawdon Crawley burst into n horse laugh by way of reply;

Miss Sharp told Crowley the Lieutenant's town address; and a few days
after this conversation, Lieutenant Osborne received a letter, in Captain
Rawdon's school-boy hand, and enclosing a note of invitation from Miss
Crawley.
rebecca despatched also an invitation to ler darling Amelia, who, you

may be sure, was ready enough to accept it when she heard that George
was to be of the party. It was arranged the Amelia was to spend the
morning with the ladies of Park Lane, where all were very kind to ler.
Rebecca patronised her with calm superiority: she was so much the
leverage of the two, and her friend so gentle and unassuming, that she
plays yielded when anybody chose to command, and so took llcbeccn's
orders with perfect weakness and good hour. Miss Crowley's gracious-
ness was also remarkable. She continued hcr raptures about little Anglia,
talked about her before her face as if she were a doll, or a servant, or a
picture, and admired her with the most benevolent wonder possible. I
admire that admiration which the genteel world sometimes extends to the
commonalty. There is no more agreeable object in life than to see My
Fair folks condescending. Miss Crawley's prodigious benevolence rather
fuatigued poor little Amelia, nndl I am not sure that of the three ladies in
lark Lane she did not find honest MIss BRiggs the most agreeable. She
sympathize with Briggs as with all neglected or gentle people: slc
wasn't what you call a woman of spirit.
George came to dinner-a repast enu argon with Captain Crawley.
The great family coach of the Shortest transported him to Park
Lane from Russell Square; where the young ladies, who were not
themselves invited, and professed the greatest indifference but that slight,
nevertheless looked at Sir Pitt Crawley's name in the baronctage; nd
learned everything which that work had to teach about the Crawley
family and their pedigree, and the Bionic, their relatives, se., &c.
Rawdon Crawley received George Osborne with great frunkness aud gra-
countless : praised his play at billiards: asked him when he would have
his revenge: was interested about Osborne's regiment: and would have
proposed picquet to him that very evening, but MIss Crawley absolutely
forbade any gambling in her house; so that the young Lieutenant's
purse was not lightened by his gallant patron, for that day at least.
However, they made an engagement for the next, somewhere: to look at
a horse that Crawley had to sell, and to try him in the ark; and to dine
together, and to pass the evening with some jolly fellows. ``That is, if you 're
not on duty to that pretty Miss Scdley,'' Crawley said, with a knowing
wink.  Monstrous nice girl, 'on my honour, though, Osborne,'' he was
good enough to add. " LOts of tin, I suppose, hp''
Osborne wasn't on duty; he would join Crawley with pleasure: and the
latter, when they met the next day, praised his new friends horscinan-
ship-as he might with perfect honesty-and introduced him to three or
four young men of the first fashion, whose acquaintance immensely coated
the simple young officer.
How 's little Miss Sharp, by-the-bye,'' Osborne inquire of his friend
over their wine, with a dignified air.  Good-natured little girl that.
Does she suit you well at queen's Crawley Miss Selley liked her a
good deal last year.''
Captain Crowley looked savagely nt the Lieutenant out of his little blue
eyes, and watched him when he went up to resume his acquaintance with
the fair governess. Her conduct must hve relieved Crawley if there was
any jealousy in the bosom of that life-guardsman.

And gave him a little nod, so cool and killing, that Radon Crowley,
watching the operations from the other room, could hardly restrain his
lighter as he saw the Lieutenant's entire liseomfiture ; the start he gcse,
the pause, and the perfect clumsiness with which he at length coudc-
scendel to take the finger which was offered for his embrace.
She 'd best the devil, by Novel'' the Captain said, in a rapture; and
the Lieutenant, by way of beginning the conversation, agreeably asked
Rebecca how she liked her new place.
My place?'' said Miss Sharp, coolly, ``how kind of you to remind me
of it It's a tolerably good place: the wages are pretty good-not so
good as Miss Wirt's, I believe, with your sisters in Russell Square. How
are those young ladies of-not that I ought to ask.''

Why not'' Mr. Osborne said, amazed.
s Why, they never condescended to speak to me, or to ask me into their
house, whilst I was staying with Amelia; but we poor goernesses, you
know, are used to slights of this sort.''

aT least in some families,'' Rebecca continued. : You can't think
what a difference there is though. We are not so wealthy in Hampshire
as you lucky folks of the city. But then I am in a gentleman's family-
good old English stock. I suppose you know Sir Pitt's father refused a
peerage. And you see how I am treated. I am pretty comfortable.
Indeed, it is rather a good place. But how very good of you to inquire''
Osborne was quite savage. The little Governess patronised him and
profiled him until this young British Lion felt quite uneasy; nor would he
muster sufficient presence of mind to find a pretext for backing out of this
most delectable conversation.
e I thought you liked the City families pretty well,'' he said haughtily.
'Last year you mean, when I was fresh from that horrid vulgar school 
Of course I did. Doesn't every girl like to come home for the holidays:
And how was I to know any better But oh, Mr. Osborne, what n if-
ference eighteen months' experience makes-eighteen months spent,
pardon me for saying so, with gentlemen. As for dear Amelia, she, I
grant you, is a pearl, and would be charming anywhere. There now, I
see you are beginning to be in a good humour; but of these queer old
City people And Mr. Jos.-how is that wonderful Mr. Joseph''
 It seems to me you didn't dislike that wonderful Mr. Joseph last year,''
Osborne said kindly.
 How severe of you1 Well, entre nous, I didn't break my heart about
him ; yet if he had asked me to do what you mean by your looks (and very
expressive and kind they are, too), I wouldn't have said no.''
Mr. Osborne give a look as much as to say, ``Indeed, how very
obligingI''
e What an honour to have had you for a brother-in-law, you are think-
ing? To be sister-in-law to George Osborne, Esquire, son of John

Thus was George utterly routed. Not that Rebecca was in the right;
but she had managed most successfully to put him in the wrong. And he
now hopefully feel, feeling if he stayed another minute, that he would
have been made to look foolish in the presence of Abelian.
Though Reloccn has had the better of lim, George was above thecan-
ness of tale-bearing or revenge upon a ldy,-only he could not help cle-
very confiding to Captain Crawley, next day, some notions of his regarding
Miss rebecca-that she was a sharp one, a dangerous one, a desperate

hours were over. They added to her original regard for Mr. Osborne.
IIcr woman's instinct had told her, that it was George who had interrupted
the success of her first love-passage, audi she esteemed him accordingly.
 I only just warn you,'' he said to Rawdon Crawley, with n knowing
look-he had bought the horse, and lost some score of guineas after dinner,
 I just warn you-I know women, and counsel you to be on the look-out.''
Thank you, my boy,'' said Crawley, with a look of peculiar gratitude.
: Yon 're wide awake, I see.'' And George went off, thinking Crawley
was quite right.
He told Amelia of what he had done, and how he had counselled Rawdon
Crawley-a devilish good, straight-forward fellow-to be on his guard
against that little sly, scheming Rebecca.
` Against lom 2'' Aelia cried.
Your friend the Governess.-Don't look so astonished,''
O George, what lae you done'' Amelia said. For er woman's
eyes, which Love had made sharp-sighted, and in one instant diseoverceda
secret which was invisible to Miss Crawley, to poor virgin Briggs, and,
above all, to the stupid keepers of that young whiskered prix, Lieutenant
Osborne.
For as Rebecca was showing her in an upper apartment, where these
two friends had an opportunity for a little of that secret talking and con-
spring which forms the delight of female life, Amelia, coming up to
Rebecca, and taking her two little hands in hers, said, ``Rebecca, I see
it all.''
Rebecca kissed her.
And regarding this delightful secret, not one syllable more was said by
either of the young women. But it was destined to come out before long.
Some short period after the above events, and Miss Rebecca Sharp still
remaining at her patroness's house in Park Lane, one more catchment
might have been seen in Great Gaunt Street, figuring amongst the many
which usually contact that dismal quarter. It was over Sir Pitt Crawley's
house; but it did not indicate the worthy baronet's demise. It was a
feminine catchment, and indeed a few years back had served as a funeral
compliment to Sir Pitt's old mother, the late dowager lady Crawley. Its
period of service over, the catchment had come down from the front of the
home, and lived in retirement somewhere in the back premises of Sir Pitt's
mansion. It re-appeared now for poor Rose Dawson. Sir Pitt was a
widower again. The arms quartered on the shield along with his own were
not, to be sure, poor Rose's. She had no arms. But the clubs painted on
the scutchcon answered as well for her as for Sir Pitt's mother, and Resuryam
was written under the coat, flanked by the Crawley Dove and Serpent.

MIr. Crawley had tended that otherwise friendless ed-side. She went out
of the world strengthened by sucli words and comfort as he could give ler.
For many years his was the only kindness she ever knew; the only friend-
ship that solace in any way that feeble, lonely soul. Her heart was dead
long before her body. She had sold it to become Sir Pitt Crawley's wife,
MOthers and daughters are making the sae bargain every any in Vanity
Fair.

127
When the demise took place, her husband was in London attending to
some of his innumerable schemes, and busy with his endless lawyers. IIe
had found time, nevertheless, to call often in Park LAne, and to despatch
many notes to Rebecca, treating her, joining her, commanding her to
return to her young pupils in the country, who were now utterly without
companionship during their mother's illness. But Miss Crawley would
not her of her departure; for though there was no lady of fashion in
London who would desert her friends more complacently as soon as she
was tired of their society, and though few tired of them sooner, yet as long
as her segment lasted her attachment was prodigious, and she clung
still with the greatest energy to Rebecca.
The news of Lady Crawley's death provoked no more grief or comment
than might have been expected in Miss Crawley's family circle.  I
suppose I must put off my party for the 3rd,'' MIss Crawley said; and
added, after a pause,``I hope my brother will have the decency not to
marry again.''  What a confounded rage Pitt will bein if he does,''
Rawdon remarked, with his usual regard for his older brother. Rebecca
said nothing. She seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the
family. She left the room before Rawdon went away that day; but they
met by chance below, as he was going away after taking leave, and in a
parley together.
On the morrow, as Rebecca was gazing from the window, she startled
Miss Crawley, who was placilly occupied with a French novel, by crying
out in an alarmed tone, ` Here's Sir Pitt, MIa'nm.'' and to baronet's
knock followed this announcement.
My dear, l1 can't see him. I won't see him. Tell Bowls not at
home, or go down stairs and say I'm too ill to receive any one. MIy
nerves really won't bear my brother at this moment ;'' cried out Miss
Crawley, and resume the noel.
 She 's too ill to see you, Sir,'' Greece said, tripping down to Sir
Pitt, who was preparing to ascend.
 So much the better,'' Sir Pitt answered.  want to see to, Miss
Becky. Come along a me into the parlour,'' and they entered that apart-
ment together.
I want you back ut queen's Crawley, Miss,'' the baronet said, fixing
his eyes upon her, and taking off his black gloves and his hat with its
great crape hit-band. His eyes lal such a strange look, and fixed upon
ler so steadfastly, that Rebecca Sharp began almost to tremble.
I hope to come soon,'' she said in an low voice, '"as soon as liss
Crawley is better-and return to-to the dear children,''
 you've said so these three months, Becky,'' replied Sir Pitt, ``and
still you go hanging on to my sister, who 'll fling you off like an old shoe,
when she's wore you out. I tell you I want you. I'm going back to
the Funeral. Will you come back? Yes or no.''
I aren't-I don't think-it would be right-to e along-with you,
Sir,'' Becky said, seemingly in great agitation.

Saying which, Rebecca went down on her knees in a most tragical way,
and, taking Sir Pitt's horny black hand between her own two (which were
very pretty and white, and as soft as satin), looked up in his face with an
expression of exquisite pathos and confidence, when-when the door
opened, and Miss Crawley sailed in.

Miss Crawley was reading the French novel, and had given that old lady
tho astounding intelligence that Sir Pitt was on his knees, proposing to
Miss Sharp. And if you calculate the time for the above dialogue to take

exactly accurate this history is, and low Miss Crawley mnet have appeared
at the very instant when Greece had assumed the attitude of hility.
' It is the lady on the ground, and not the gentleman,'' Miss Crowley
said, with a look and voice of great scorn. They told me that you were

couple.''
:I hae thanked Sir Pitt Crawley, ma'am,'' Rebecca soil, rising, `'and

lips of wonder.

Pi?'' the old lady asked.
Ees,'' said the Baronet, `'I did.''
And she refused you as she says2 ''

It does not seem to break your heart at any rte,'' MIss Crawley
remarked.
Anna a bit,'' answered Sir Pitt, with a cooluess and good-humor
which set Miss Crawley almost mad with bewilderment. nt an old gen-
tleman of station should fall on his knees to a penniless averages, and
burst out laughing because she refused to marry him,-that n hercules
governess should refuse a Baronet with four thousand a year,-these were
mysteries which Miss Crawley could never comprehend. It surpassed any
complications of intrigue in her favourite Painful le Brun.
I'm glad you think it good sport, brother,'' she continual, groping
wildly through this amazement.
 Famous,'' said Sir Pitt. wHo' he' thought it what a sly little
dell want a little fox it was1'' he muttered to himself, chuckling with
pleasure.

she sank down in a chair so pathetically, that most of the audience present
were perfectly melted with her sadness.

he walked away-greatly to Referee's relief; for it was evident that her

who would have followed her up-stairs, she went up to her apartment;
while Briggs and Miss Crawley, in a high state of excitement, remained to
discuss the strange event, and Firkin, not less moved, dived down into the
kitchen regions, and talked of it with all the male and female company
there. And so impressed was Mrs. Firkin with the news, that she thought
proper to write off by that very night's post, ``' with her humble duly to
Mrs. Bute Crawley and the family at the Rectory, and Sir Pitt has been and
proposed for to marry Miss Sharp, wherein she was refused him to the
wonder of all,''
The two ladies in the dining-room (where worthy Miss Briggs was
delighted to be admitted once more to a confidential conversation with her
patroness) wondered to their hearts' content at Sir Pitt's offer, and llebccca's
refusal; riggs very acutely suggesting that there must have been so
obstacle in the shape of a previous attachment, otherwise you oman
in her senses would ever have refused so advantageous a proposal.
You would have accepted it yourself, wouldn't you, Briggs :'' Miss
Crowley said, kind.
WOuld it not be a privilege to be less Crawley's sister P'' Briggs
replied, with meek evasion.
 II, BEcky would have made a good Lady Crawley, after all,'' Miss
Crawley remarked, (who was mollified by the girl's refusal, and very liberal
and generous now there was no call for her sacrifices.) `` She s brains in
plenty (much more it in her little finger than you have my poor dear
riggs in all your hell.) Her manners are excellent now l ave formed
her. She is a Montmoreucy, Briggs, anl blood is something, though I
despise it for my part; and she would have held her own amongst those
pompous stupid IInmpshire people much better than that unfortunate
ironmonger's daughter.''
BRiggs coincided as usual, and the ``previous attachment'' was then
discussed in conjectures. `ou poor fricudless creatures nrc always
having some foolish terre,'' Miss Crawley said. ``You yourself, you
know, were in love with a writing aster (don't cry, riggs-you're
always crying, and it won't bring him to life again), and I suppose this
unfortunate Becky has been silly and sentimental too-some apothecary,
or house-steward, or printer, or young curate, or something of that sort.''
Poor thing, poor thing'' says riggs (who was thinking of twenty-
four years back, and that hectic young writing master whose lock of
yellow hair, and whose letters, beautiful in their illcgibility, she cherished
in her old desk up stairs.) `Poor thing poor thing.'' says Briggs.
Once more she was a fresh-checked lass of eighteen; she was at evening
churel and the hectic writing master and she were quavering out of the
same psalm-book.
 After such conduct on Rebecca's part,'' Miss Crawley sail enthusiastic-
fully, ``on family should do something. Find out who is the oliet,
Briggs. I'll set him up in a slow; or order my portrait of him, you
know; or speak to my cousin the Bishop-and I'll voter Becky, and we'll
have a wedding, briggs, and you shall muck the breakfast, and be a brides'
maid,''
Briggs declared that it would be delightful, and rowed that her year
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
Miss Crawley was always kind and generous, and went up to Rebecca's
bed-room to console her and rattle about the offer, and the refusal, al
the cause thereof; and to hint at the generous intentions of Miss Crawley,
and to find out who was the gentleman that had the mastery of Miss
Sharp's heart.
Rebecca was very kind, very affectionate and affected-responded to
Briggs' offers of tenderness with grateful fervour-owned there was a
secret attachment-a delicious mystery-what a pity Miss bRiggs had not
remained half a minute longer at the key-hotel Rebecca might, perhaps,
he told more : but five minutes after Miss Briggs' arrival in Rebecca's
apartment, Miss Crawley actually made her appearance there-an unheard
of honour ;-her impatience and overcome her; she could not wait for the
tardy operations of her nmbassadress: so she came in person, and ordered
Briggs out of the room. And expressing ler approval of Rebecca's con-
duct, she asked particulars of the interview and the previous transactions
which had brought about the astonishing offer of Sir Pitt.
Rebecca said she had long had soe notion of the partiality with
which Sir Pitt couture her, (for he was in the habit of making his feelings
known in a very frank and unreserved manner) but, not to mention private
reasons with which she would not for the present trouble Miss Crawley,
Sir Pitt's age, station, and habits were such as to render a marriage quite
impossible ; and could a woman with any feeling of self-respect and any
decency listen to proposals nt such a moment, when the funeral of the
lover's defense wife had not actually taken place
 Nonsense, my dear, you would never have refused him had there not

I wish you could, denr Madam,'' Rebecca said in the same tearful
tone. `Single, indeed I need it.'' And she said her head upon Miss
Crowley's shoulder and wept there so naturally that the old lady, surprise
into sympathy, embrace her with an almost maternal kindness, uttered
many soothing protests of regard and affection for her, owed that she
loved her as a daughter, and would do everything in her power to serve
her. And new who is it, my car Is it that pretty Miss Sedley's

But I love me always-promise you will love me always.'' And in the
midst of mutual tears-for the emotions of the younger woman had
awakened the sympathies of the elder-this promise was solely
given by Miss Crawley, who left her little protege, blessing and admir-
ing her as a dear, artless, tender-hearted, affectionate, incoinpreliensible
creature.
And now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful
events of the day, and of what had been and what might have been.

Well then, in the first place, Rebecca gave way to some very sincere
and touching regrets that a piece of marvellous goo fortune should have
been so near her, and she actually obliged to decline it. In this natural
motion every properly regulated mind will certainly share. What good
mother is there that would not commiserate a penniless spinster, who
might have cen my lady, and have shared for thousand a year What
well-bred young person is there in all Vanity sir, who will not feel for a
hard-working, ingenious, meritorious girl, who gets such an honourable,
advantageous, provoking offer, just at the very moment when it is out of
her power to accept it I am sure our friend bEcky's disappointment
reserves and will command every sympathy.
I remember one night being in the Fair myself, at an evening party.
I observed oll Miss only there also present, single out for her special
attentions anl flattery little Mrs. Priceless, the barrister's wife, who
is of a good family certainly, but, as we all know, is as poor as poor
can be.

part of MIss Tony; has Brieflcss got a county court, or has his wife had

box at the Opera; and I would have been presented next season. All
this it have been; but now-now all was doubt and mystery.
BUt Ilebeeea was a young lady of too much resolution and energy of
character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the
irrevocable past; so, having devoted only the proper portion of regret to
it, she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future, which was
on vastly more important to her. And she surveyed her position, and
its hopes, doubts, and change.
In the first place, she was martial;-that was a great fct. sIr Pitt
knew it., She was not so much surprised into the vowel, as induced to
make it by a sudden calculation. lt must have come some day; and why
not now as at a later period He who would have married her himself
must at least be silent with regard to her marriage. BUt how Miss
Crawley would bear the news-was the great question. MIsgivings
Rebecca had; but she remcberel all Miss Crawley has said; the old
lady's avowed contempt for birth; her daring liberal opinions; her general
romantic propensities; her almost doting attachment to her nephew, and
her repeatedly-expressed fondness for Rebecca herself. She is so fond of
him, Ilelecea thought, that she will forgive him anything: she is so used
to me that I don't think she could be comfortable without me: when
the lairciassement comes there will be a scene, and hysterics, nd n great
quarrel, and then a great reconciliation. At all events, what use was
there in delaying' the die was throw, nnl now or to-morrow the issue
must be the same. And so, resolved that Miss Crawley should have the
news, the young person debate in her mind as to the best mons of
conveying it to her; and whether she should face the storm that must
come, or try and avoid it until its First fury was blown over. In this state

rebecca said, with whom she had resumed an active correspondence of
late) and who used to fetch these letters from the saddler's, wore brass
spurs, and large curling mustaclios, and was indeed no other than
Captain Ruwdon Crawley.

NOW they were married is not of
the slightest consequence to any
body. What is to hinder a Captain
who is a major, and a young lady
who is of age, from purchasing a
license, and uniting themselves at
any church in this town Who
needs to be told, that if a woman
has a will, she will assuredly find
a way ?-MIy belief is, that one
day, when Miss Sharp had gone
to pass the forenoon with her
lear friend Miss Amelia Scdley,
in Russell-square, a lady very like
her might have been seen enter-
in a church in the city, in co-
pay with a gentleman with dyed
muastachoes, who, after a quarter
of an hour's interval, escorted her
back to the hackney-coach in
waiting, and that this was a quick
bridal party.
Aud who on earth, after the daily experience we have, cnn question the
probability of a gentleman marrying any body HOw many of the wise
aul learned have married their cooks? Dil not Lord Eldon himself, the
most prudent of men, make a run-away match Were not Achilles and
Ajax both in love with their servant maids And are we to expect a
heavy dragoon with strong desires and small brains, who had never con-
trolley a passion in his life, to become prudent all of a sudden, and to
refuse to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind If
people only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there
would be
It seems to me, for my part, that Mr. Rawdon's marriage was one of
the honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that
gentleman's biography which has to do with the present history. No one
will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman, or, being captivated,
to marry her; and the admiration, the delight, the passion, the wonder,
the unbounded confidence, and frantic adoration with which, by degrees,
this big warrior got to regard the little Rebecca, were feelings which the
allies at least will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him,

When she sang, every note thrilled in his dull soul, and tinglel through
hs huge from: When she spoke, le brought  the roree r u brand
to listen and wonder. If she was jocular, he used to revolve her jokes in
his mind, and explode over the half an hour afterwards in the street,
to the surprise of the room in the tilbury by his side, or the comrade
riding with him in Rotten Row. Her words were oracles to him, her
smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom. lOw she
sings,-how she pints,'' thought he.  How she rode that kicking mare
ant queen's Curley1'' And he would say to her in confidential moments,
By Jove, Beek, you're fit to be Commander-in-Chief, or Archbishop of
Canterbury, by Jove.'' Is his case a rare one and don't we see every
day in the world many an honest IIereules at the apron-strings of People,
and great whiskered Reasons prostrate in Delilah's up 
When, then, Becker told him that the great crisis was near, and the
time for action had arrived, Rawdon expressed himself is ready to act
under her orders, as he would be to charge with his troops at the command
of his colonel. There was no need for him to put his letter into the third
volume of Porters. Rebecca easily found a means to get rid of bRiggs,
her companion, and met her faithful friend in '` the usual place'' on the next
day. She had thought over matters at night, and communicate to nw-
don the result of her determinations. He agreed, of course, to every
thing; was quite sure that it was all right; that what she proposed was
best ; that Miss Crawley would infallibly relent, or ``come round,'' as he
said, after a time. And Rebecca's resolutions been entirely different, he
would have followed them as implicitly. : You have had enough for
both of us, Beck,'' said he. ``on're sure to get us out of the scrape. I
never sa your equal, and I've met with some clippers in my time to,''
And with this simple confession of faith, the love-stricken dragoon left he
to execute his part of the project which she had formed for the pair.
It consisted simply in the hiring of quiet lodgings at Brompton, or in
the neighbourhood of the barracks, for Captain and MIrs. Crawley. For
Rebecca had determined, and very prudently, we think, to fly. wilson
was only too happy at hcr resolve; he had been treating her to take this
measure any tie for weeks past. 1Ie praneed off to change the lodgings
with all the impetuosity of love. He agreed to pay two guineas a week so
readily, that the landlady regretted she had asked him so little. He
ordered in a piano, and half a nursery house full of flowers, and a heap of
good things. As for shawls, kid gloves, silk stockings, gold French
watches, bracelets and perfumery, he sent them in with the profusion of
blind love und unbounded credit. And having relieved his mind by this
outpouring of generosity, he went and dined nerously at the club, waiting
until the great moment of his life should come.
The occurrences of the previous day; the admirable conduct of Rebecca
in refusing an offer advantageous to her, the secret unhappiness preying
upon her, the sweetness and silence with which she bore her aflliction,
made Miss Crawley much more tender than usual. An event of this
nature, in marriage, or a refusal, or a proposal, thrills through a whole
hopeful of women, and sets all their hysterical sympathies at work. As

nn observer of human nature, I regularly frequent St. George's, Hanover
Square, during the genteel marriage season; and though I havenescr see
the bridegroom's male friends give way to tens, or the bundles and police-
acting clergy any wny affected, yet it is not at all uncommon to see women
who are not in the least concerned in the operations going to-old ladies
who are long past marrying, stout middle-aged females with plenty of sons
and daughters, let alone pretty young creatures in pink bonncts, who are
on their promotion, and may naturally take an interest in the ceremony,-I
say it is quite common to see the women present piping, sobbing, unwilling.
hiding their little faces in their little useless pocket-handkerchiefs, and
heaving old and young with emotion. When my friend, the fashionable
John ilico, married the lovely Lady Belgravia Green Parker, the emo-
tion was so general, that even the little scully old pew-opener who lct mo
into the seat, was in tears. And wherefore? I cnquired of my own soul:
she was not going to be married.
Miss Crawley and Briggs in a word, after the algir of Sir Pitt, indulge
in the utmost luxury of sentiment, and llebeccn became an object of the
most tender interest to then. In her absence Miss Crawley solace ler-
self with the most sentimental of the novels in her library. Little Sharp,
with her secret griefs, was the heroine of the day.
lnt night rebecca sang ore swveetly and talked ore pleasantly than
she had ever been heard to do in Park Lane. She twined herself round
the heart of Miss Crawley. She spoke lightly and laughingly of Sir Pitt's
proposal, ridiculed it as the foolish fancy of an old man; and hcr eyes filled
with tears, and Briggs's heart with unutterable pangs of defeat, as she
said she desired no other lot that to remain for ever with her dear bone-
fractures. `` My dear little creature,'' the old lady said, ' I don't intend to
let you stir for years, that you may depend upon it. As for going back
to that odious brother of mine after what has passcl, it is out of the ques-
tion. Were you stay with me and bRiggs. Briggs wants to go to see
her relations very often. b3riggs, you a go when you like. bUt as for
you, my dur, you must stay and take care of the old woman.''
II lnwdon Crowley had been then and there present, instead of being
at the club nervously drinking claret, the pair might have gone down on
their knees before the old spinster, avowed all, and been forgiven in a
twinkling. But that good chance was denial to the young couple, doubt-
less in order that this story might be written, in which numbers of their
wonderful adventures are narrated-adventures which could never have
occurred to them if they had been housed and sheltered under the com-
portable interesting forgiveness of Miss Crawley.
Under MIrs. Firkin's orders, in the Park Lane establishment, was a young
woman from klnmpshire, whose business it was, among other duties, to
knock at Mies Sharp's door with that jug of hot water, which Sirkin
would rather have perished than have presented to the intruder. This
girl, bred on the family estate, had a brother in Captain Crawley's troop,
and if the truth were known, I daresay it would come out that she was
aware of certain arrangements, which have a great deal to do with this
history. At any rate she purchased an yellow seal, a pair of green boots,

and a light blue hat with a red feather, with three guineas which Rebecca
gave her, and as little Sharp was by no means too liberal with her money,
no doubt it was for services rendered that Betty Martin was so bribed.
On the second day after Sir Pitt Crowley's offer to Miss Sharp, the sun
rose as usual, and at the usual hour Betty Martin, the upstairs maid,
knocked at the door of the governess's bed-chamber.
No answer was returned, and she knocked again. Silence was still
uninterrupted ; and Betty, with the hot water, opened the door and en-
tered the chamber.
he little white dimity bel was as smooth and trim as on the day previous
when Betty's own hands had helped to make it. Two little trunks were
corded in one end of the room; and on the table before the window-on
the inclusion-the great fat pinetshion lined with pink inside, and willed
like a lady's nightcap-by a letter. -. It had been reposing there probably
all night.
Betty advanced towards it on tiptoe, as if she were afraid to awake it-
looked at it, and round the room with an air of great wonder and santiago-
tion, took up the letter, and gained intensely as she turned it round and
over, and finally carried it in to Miss Briggs's room below.
How could Betty tell that the letter was for Miss Briggs, I should like
to know All the schooling Betty had was at Mrs. Bute Crawley's Sun-
day School, and she could no more read stRing than Hebrew.
`La, Miss Briggs,'' the girl cxselaimel, ' O,liss, something must have

say, ``devoured the contents'' of the letter addressed to her.

Just ns Briggs had finished renting this affecting and interesting docu-
ment, which reinstated her in her position as first confidante of Miss Crew-
ley, Irs. Firkin entered the room.  Ilere's Mrs. lUte Crawley just
arrived by the mail from Hampshire, and wants some teu, will you come

And to the surprise of arkin, clasping her dressing-gown around her,

sticking in bunches round her forceful, Briggs sailed down to MIrs. lute
with the letter in her hand containing the wonderful news.

When MIrs. Bute Crawley, numbed with midnight travelling, and warm-
ing herself at the newly crackling parlour fire, herd from Miss Briggs the
intelligence of the clandestine marriage, she declared it was quite prove-
lential that she should have arrived at such a time to assist poor dear
Miss Crawley in supporting the shock-the lcbccca was an artful little
husky of whom she had always had her suspicions; and that s for
landon Crawley, she never could account for his aunt's infatuation regard-
in him, and had long considered him a profligate, lost, and abandoned
being. And this awful conduct, MIrs. Bute said, will have at least is
good effect, it will open poor dear Miss Crawley's eyes to the real cha-
raster of this wicket mn. Than MIrs. But had a comfortable hot trust
and tea; and as there was a vacant room in the house now, there was
a need for her to remain at the Gloster Coffee House where the portsmouth
mail had set her down, and whence she ordered MIr. Bowls's aide-de-camp
the footman to bring away her trunks.
Miss Crawley, be it known, did not leave her room until near noon-
taking chocolate in bed in the morning, while Becky Sharp rend the
Morning out to her, or otherwise amusing herself or dawdling. The
conspirators below agrcel that they would spare the denr lady's feelings
until she appeared in her drawing-room: meanwhile it was announced to
her, that Mrs. Bute Crowley had come up from Hampshire by the mail,
was staying at the Gloster, sent her love to Miss Crawley, and asked for
breakfast with Miss Briggs. The arrival of Mrs. Bute, which would not
have caused any extreme delight at another period, was hailed with plea-
sure now; Miss Crawley being pleased at the notion of a gossip with her
sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawley, the funeral arrangements
spending, and Sir Pitt's abrupt proposals to Rebecca.
142
VANITY FAIR.
It was not until the old lady was fairly ensconced in her usual arm-
chair in the drawing-room, and the preliminary embraces and inquiries
had taken place between the ladies, that the conspirators thought it nevis-
able to submit her to the operation. Who has not admired the artifice
and delicate approaches with which women ``prepare'' their friends for
bal news Miss Crawley's two friends made such an apparatus of my-
term before they broke the intelligence to her, that they worked her up to
the necessary degree of doubt and alarm.
`'And she refused Sir Pitt, my dear dear Miss Crawley, prepare your-
self for it,'' Mrs. Bute said, ``because-because she couldn't help herself.''
Of course there was a reason,'' Miss Crawley answered. ``She like
somebody else. I told Briggs so yesterday.''
 Likes somebody else1'' Briggs gasped. O my dear friend, she is
married already.''
Married already,'' Mrs. Bute chimed in; and both state with clasped
Hands looking from each other at their victim.
` Send her to me, the instant she comes in. The little sly wretcl: how
land she not tell me?'' tried out Miss Crawley.
She won't come in soon. Prepare yourself, dear friend-she's gone
out of  long time-she's-she 's gone altogether.''
 Gracious goodness, and he's to make my chocolate Sold for her
and have her back; I desire that she come bnek,'' the old lady said.
She lccnmped last night, Ma'am,'' cried Mrs. Bute.
 She left a letter for me,'' Briggs exclaimed.  She's married to-''

the bell with all her might.

worse herself,'' said Mrs. Bute.
Miss Crawley gave a final scream, and fell back in a faint. They were
forced to take her back to the room which she had just quittel. One ft
of hysterics succeeded another. The doctor was sent for-the apotheeary
arrived. Mrs. Bute took up the post of nurse by her bedside. `:1Her

`' Are you not aware, Sir,'' Miss Briggs asked, `` that she has left our
roof, to -the dismay of Miss Crawley, who is nearly killed by the intelli-
genre of Captain Rawdon's union with her?''
WHen Sir Pitt Crawley heard that Rebecca was married to his son, he
broke out into a fury of language, which it would do no good to repeat in
this place, as indeed it sent poor BRiggs shuddering out of the room; and
with her we will shut the door upon the figure of the frenzied old man,
wild with hatred and insane with battled desire.
One day after he went to queen's Crawley, he burst like a madman
into the room she he used when there-dashed open hcr boxes with his
foot, and flung about her papers, clothes, and other relics. Miss jorrocks,
the butler's daughter, took some of them. The children dressed them-
selves and acted plays in the others. It was but a few days after the
poor mother had gone to her lonely burying-place; and was laid, unrest
and disregarded, in a vault full of strangers.
Suppose the old lady doesn't come to,'' Rawdon said to his little wife,
as they sate together in the snug little Brompton lodgings. She had been
trying the new piano all the oruing. he new gloves fitted her to a
nicety; the new shawls became her wonderfully; the ne rings littered on
her little hands, and the new watch ticked at her waist; ``suppose sle

cheek.

his virtues, and the sorrows of his heir, who is disposing of his goods.

OF all the other articles which MIr. IInmmerdown lal the honour to offer
for public competition that day it is not our purpose to make mention,
save of one only; this was a little square piano which came down from the
upper regions of the house (the state grand piano having been disposed of
previously); this the young lady trial with a rapid and skilful hand,
(making the officer blush and start again), and for it, wlcn its turn came,

But there was an opposition here. Tho Hebrew aide-de-camp in the

little piano, the combatants being greatly encouraged by Mr, IIammerlown.
At last, when the competition had been prolonged for some time, the
elephant captain and lady desisted from the race; and the hamer
coming down, the auetioneer said :-`Mr. Lewis, twenty-five,'' and Mr.
Lewis's chief ths became the proprietor of the little square piano.

days, when she used to play upon it, in the little sitting-room of our denr
Aelia Sedley.
The sale was at the old house in russell Square, where we passed somc
evenings together at the beginning of this story. Good old John Sedley
was a ruined man. His name had been proclaimed as n defaulted on the
Stock Exchange, and his bankruptcy and commercial extermination had
followed. Mr. Osborne's butler came to buy some of the famous port
wine to transfer to the cellars over the way. As for one dozen well-
manufactured silver spoons and forks at per oz., and one dozen dessert
lotto ditto, there were three young stockbrokers (Meters. Dale, piggot,
and Dale, of Threadneedle street, indeed), who having hal dealings with
the old man, and kindness from him in days when he was kind to
every body with whom he dealt, sent this little spar out of the week with
their love to good MIrs. Sedley; and with respect to the piano, as it has
been Amelia's, and as she might miss it and want one now, and as Can-
tain William Dohbin could no more play upon it, than he could dance on
the tight-rope, it is probable tlmnt he did not purchase it for his own use.
In n word, it arrived that evening, at a wonderful small cottage in a
street leading from the Full Road-one of those streets which have
the finest romantic names-(this was called St. Adelaide Villas, Ana-
Maria Road, West), where the houses look like baby-houses; were the
people looking out of the first-floor windows, must infallibly, as you think,
it with their feet in the parlours; where the shrubs in the little gardens
in front, bloom with a perennial display of little children's pinafores, little
red socks, caps, &c. (polyandry polygyny); whence you hear the sound
of jingling spines and women singing; where little porter pots hang on
the railings sunning themselves; whither of evenings you see city clerks
paying wearily : here it was that Mr. Clapp, the clerk of Mr. Selley, had
his domieile, and in this asylum the good old gentleman hid his hud
with his wife and daughter when the crash camc.
Jos Sedley had acted as a man of his disposition would, when the an-
atonement of the family-misfortune reached him. lIe did not come to
London, but he wrote to his mother to draw upon his agents for whatever
money was wanted, so that is kind broken-spirited old parents had no
resent poverty to fear. This done, Jos went on at the boarding-house
nt Cheltenham pretty much as before. IIe love lis curricula; he drunk
his claret; he played his rubber; he told his Indian stories, and the Irish
widow consoled and flattered him as usual. IIis present of money, neeilful
as it was, made little impression on his parents; and I have heard Amelia
say, tnt the first day on which she saw her father lift u his head often
the failure, was on the receipt of the packet of forks and spoons with the
young stockroker's love, over which he burst out, crying like a child,
being greatly more affected than even his wife, to whom the present was
addressed. Edward Dale, the junior of the house, who purchased the
spoons for tie firm, was, in fact, very secret upon Amelia, and offered for
her in spite of all. Ho married Miss Louisa Cutts (daughter of 1higham

I hope the render has much too good an opinion of Captain and Mrs.

money, and could be serviceable to them is no possible manner. rEbecca
was entirely surprised at the sight of the comfortable old house where she
had met with no small kindness, ransacked by brokers and bargaiuers, and
its quiet family treasures given up to public desecration and plunder. A

Prineo Ehrenberg, and even the present Marquis of Londonderry, were
puzzled ; but how was this intelligence to safety a young lady in Russell
square, before whose door the watchmen sang the hours when slc was
asleep: who, if she strolled in the square, was guarded there by the
railings and the beadle: who, if she walked ever so short a distance to
buy a ribbon in Southampton Row, was followed by black Sambo with an
enormous cane: who was always cared for, dressed, put to bed, and
watched over by her so many guardian angels, with and without wages.

Old Sedley ld kept his own and counsel. Everything seemed to go on
as usual in the quiet, opulent house: the good-naturel mistress pursuing,
quite unsuspiciously, her bustling idleness, and daily easy avocutions; the
daughter absorbed still in one selfish, tender thought, and quite regard-
less of all the world besides, when that foul crash cae under which the
worthy family fell.
One night Mrs. Sedley was writing cards for a party; the Stories had
given one, and she must not be behiundhand; John Sedley, who had come

John Sedley spring up out of his chair to meet his wife, who run to

ruined, MIury. We've got the world to begin over again, dear. It's best
that you should know all, and at one.'' As he spoke, he trembled in

it was he that is the most moved, sudden as the stock was to her.
When he sank back into his seat, it was the wife that took the office of
console. She took lis trembling hand, and kissecl it, and put it round
her neck: she called him her John-her dear John-her old mau-her
kind old man: she poured out a hundred words of incoherent love and
tenderness; her faithful voice and simple caresses wrought this sad heart
up to in inexpressible delight and anguish, and covered and solace his
overburdened soul.

general confession-only once did the luithlul wife give way to emotion.
`My God, my God, it will break Any's heart,'' she said.

could not tell the old mother her doubts and cures: tho would-be sisters
seemed every day more strage to hcr. And she had misgivings and fours
which she dared not acknowledge to herself, though she was always
secretly brooding over them.
Her heart tried to persist in asserting that George Osborne was worthy
and faithful to her, though she knew otherwise. How many a thing hd
she said, and got no echo from him. IlIow many suspicions of selfishness
and indifference had she to encounter and obstinately overcome. To
whom could the poor little martyr tell these daily struggles and tortures ?
Her lero himself only half understood her. She did not dare to own
that the man she loved ws hcr inferior; or to feel that she had given her
heart away too soon. Given one, the pure bashful maiden was too
modest, too tender, too trustful, too weak, too much woman to call it,

So imprisoned and tortured was this gentle little heart, when in the
month of March, Anno Domino 1815, Napoleon landel at Cnes, an
Louis XVIII. fled, and all Europe was in alarm, and the funds fell, and
old Joh Sedley wass ruined.
We are not going to follow the worthy old stockbroker through those
last pangs and agonies of ruin through which he passed before his com-
mercia demise betel. They declared him at the Stock Exchange; he was
absent from his house of business: his bills were protested : his act of
bankruptcy formal. The house and furniture of Russell Square were
seized and sold up, and he and his family were thrust away, as we have
seen, to while their heads where they might.
John Sedley had not the heart to review the domestic establisluuent
who have appeared now and non in our pages, and of whom he was now
forced by poverty to take leave. hc wages of those worthy people were
discharged with that punctuality which men frequently slow who only own
in great sums-they were sorry to leave good places-but they did not
break their hearts at parting from their adored master and mistress.

severely, that in six weeks he learned more than he had done for fifteen
years before-the most determined and obstinate seemed to be Jolmn
Osborne, his old friend and neighbour-John Osborne, whom he had set
up in life-who was under a hundred obligations to him-and whose son
was to marry Schley's daughter. Any one of these circumstances would
account For the bitterness of Osborne's opposition.
When one man has been under very remarkable obligations to another,
with whom he subsequently quarrels, a common sense of decency, as it
were, makes of the former a much severe enemy than a merestranger would
be. To account for your own hardheartcdness and ingratitude in such a
case, you are bound to prove the other party's crime. It is not that you
are selfish, brutal, and angry at the failure of a speculation-no, no-it is
that your partner has led you into it by the basest treachery and with the
most sinister motives. From a mere sense of consistency, a persecutor is
bound to show that the fallen man is a villain-otherwise he thc persccutor

And as a general rule, which may make all creditors who are inclined
to be severe, pretty comfortable in their minds, no men embarrassed are

irritate him: these are always a cause of hostility aggravated. Finally, he
had to break off the match between Sedley's daughter and his son; and as
it had gone very far indeed, and as the poor girl's happiness and perhaps
character were compromised, it was necessary to show the strongest
reasons for the rupture, and for John Osborne to prove John Sedley to be
a very bad character indeed.
At the meetings of resistors, then, he comforted himself with a vagueness
and scorn towards Sedlcy, which almost succeeded in breaking the heart
of that ruined bankrupt man. On George's intercourse with Amelia he
put an instant veto-menacing the youth with maledictions if he broke his
commands, and vilipenling the poor innocent girl as the bases and most
artful of vixens. One of the great conditions of anger and hatred is, that
you must tell and believe lies against the hated object, in order, as we said,
to be consistent.

When the great crash came-the announcement of ruin, and the de-
pasture from Russell Square, and the declaration that all was over between
her and George-all over between her and love, her and happiness, her
and faith in the world-a brutal letter from John Osborne told her in a
few curt lines that her father's conduct had been of such a nature that all
engagements between the families were at an end-when the final award
came, it did not stock her so much as her parents, as her mother rather
expected (for John Sedley himself was entirely prostrate in the ruins of
his own affairs and shattered honour). amelia took the news very pulley
and calmly. It was only the confirmation of the dark presages which had
long gone before. It was the mere reading of the sentence-of the crime
she had long ago been guilty-the crime of loving wrongly, too violently,
against reason. She told no more of her thoughts now than she had
before. She seemed scarcely more unhappy now when convinced nll

was gone. So she changed from the large house to the small one without
any mark or difference ; remains less in her little room for the most

him to marry his daughter to the son of such a villain, and he ordered

moment. Along cngugemcnt is a partnership which one party is free to
keep or to break, but which involves all the capital of the other.
Be cautious then, young ladies; be wary how you engage. Be shy of
loving frankly; never tell all you feel, or (a better way still) feel very
little. See the consequences of being prematurely honest ad confiding,
and mistrust yourselves and everybody. Get yourselves married as they
do in France, where the lawyers are the bridesmaids and confidantes. At
any rate, never had any feelings which may make you uncomfortable, or
make any promises which you cannot at any required moment command
and withdraw. That is the way to get on, and be respected, and have a
virtuous character in Vanity Fair.
If Amelia could have heard the comments regarding her which were
male in the circle from which her father's ruin had just driven Her, she
would have seen what her own crimes were, and how entirely her character
was jeopardize. Such criminal imprudence Mrs. Smith never know of;
such torrid familiarities Mrs. Brown lad always condemned, and the end
might be a warning to her daughters. ``Captain Osborne, of course,
could not marry a bankrupt's daughter,'' the Miss Dobbins sail.  It
was quite enough to have bccn swindled by the father. As for that little

Anything like William's infatuation about that silly little flirting, ogliug
thing was never known, the mamma anl sisters agreed together in thinking
and they trembled lest, her engagement being off with Osborne, she should
take up immediately her other admirer and Captain. In which forelodings
these worthy young women no doubt judged according to the best of their
experience; or rather (for ss yet they had had no opportunities or marrying
or of tilting) according to their own notions of right and wrong.
It is a mercy, Mamma, that the regiment is ordered abroad,'' the
girls said. ``This danger, at any rate, is spared our brother,''
Such, indeed, was the fact; and soil is that the French eMperor comes
in to perform a part in this domestic comely of Vanity Fair which we are
now playing, and which would never have been enacted without the inter-
mention of this august multi personage. It was he that ruined the Four-
ons and Mr. John Sedley. It was he whose arrival in his capital called
up all France in arms to defend him there; and all Europe to oust him.
While the French nation and army were swearing fidelity round the eagles
in the Camp de Mai, four mighty European hosts are getting in motion
for the great classe i l'aisle,: and one of these was a British army, of which
two heroes of ours, Captain Dobbin aud Captain Osborne, formed a
portion.
The news of Napoleon's escape and landing was received by the gallant
-th with a fiery delight and enthusiasm, which everybody can understand
who knows that famous corps. rom the colonel to the smallest drummer
in the regiment, all were filled with hope and ambition and patriotic jury;
and thanked the French Emperor as for a personal kindness in coming
to disturb the peace of Europe. Now was the time the -th had so
long panted for, to show their comrades in arms that they could fight as
well as the Peninsular veterans, and that all the pluck and valour of the
-th had not been killed by the West Indies and the yellow fever. Stubble
and Spoon looked to get their companies without purchase. Before the
end of the campaign (which she resolved to share), Mrs. Major O'Dowd
hoped to write herself Mrs. Colonel O'Dowd,C.B. Our two friends (Dobbin
anl Osborne) were quite as much excited as the rest: and each in his
way-Mr. Dolbin very quietly, Mr. Osborne very loudly and energetic-
cnlly-was bent upon doing his duty, and gaining his share of honour and
distinction.
Te agitation thrilling through the country and army in consequence of
this news was so great, that private matters were little needed: and hence
probably George Osborne, just gazetted to his company, busy with prepa-
rations for the march, which must come inevitably, and panting for further
promotion-was not so much affected by other incidents which would
have interested him at a more quiet period. IIe was not, it must be con-

messed, very much cast down by good old Mr. Sedley's catastrophe. He
tried his new uniform, which became him very handsomely, on the day
when the first meeting of the creditors of the unfortunate gentleman took
place. His father told him of the wicked, rascally, shameful conduct of
the bankrupt, reminded him of what he had said about Amelia, and that
their conncxion was broken off for ever; and gave him that evening a
good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in which he
looked so well. Money was always useful to this free-ended young
fellow, and he took it without many world. The bills were up in the
Sedley house, where he had passed so many, many happy hours. Hc could
see them as he walked from home that night (to holD Slaughter', where
he put up when in town) shining white in the moon. That comfortable
home was shut, then, upon Amelia and her parents: where had they taken
refuge The thought of their ruin affected him not a little. He was
very melancholy that night in the colfec-room at the Slaughtcrs; and
rank a good deal, as his comrades remarked there.
Dobbin came in presently, cautioned him about the drink, which he
only took, he said, because he was reduced low; but when his friend
began to put to him clumsy inquiries, and asked him for news in a sign-
cannot manner, Osborne declined entering into conversation with him;
vowing, however, that he was devilish disturbed and unhappy.
Three days afterwards, Dobbin found Osborne in his room at the bar-
racks :-his head on the table, a number of papers about, the young
Captain evidently in a state of great desponlency. ` She's-she's sent
me back some things I gave her-some damned trinkets. Look heroes''
1here was a little packet directed in the well-known and to Captain
George Osborne, and some things lying about-a ring, a siler knife he
had bought, as a boy, for her at a fair; a gold chain, and a locket with
hair in it. ' It's all over,'' said he, with a groan of sickening remorse.
Look, Will, you may reat it if you like.''
There was a littleletter of a few lines, to which he pointed, which said:
' MIy papa has ordered me to return to you these presents, which you
made in happier days to be; and I am to write to you for the last time.
I think, I kluow you feel as much as I do the blow which has come upon
ns. It is I that absolve you from an engagement which is impossible in
our present misery. I am sure you had to share in it, or in the cruel sus-
icons of Mir. Osborne, wvlicl are the hardest of all our griefs to bear.
Farewell. Farewell. I pray Go to strengthen me to bear this and other
calamities, and to bless you always.

Dolbin was very soft-hearted. The sight of women and children in
pain always used to melt him. the idea of Amelia broken-called and
lonely, tore that good-natured soul with anguish. And he broke out into
an emotion, which anybody who likes may consider unmanly. He swore
that Melia was an angel, to which Osborne suid aye with all his heart.
He, too, had been reviewing the history of their lives,-and had seen her

from her childhood to her present age, so sweet, so innocent, so charm-
singly simple, and ruthlessly fond and tender.
What a pang it was to lose all that: to have had it and not prized it
A thousand homely scenes and recollections crowded on him-in which he
always saw her good and beautiful. And for himself, he flushed with
remorse and shame, as the remembrance of his own selfishness and india-
ference contrasted with that perfect purity. For a while, glory, war, every-
thing was forgotten, and the pair of friends talked about her only.
wHere are they P'' Osborne asked, after a long talk, and a long pause,
-and, in truth, with no little same at thinking that he had taken no steps
to follow her.  Where are they There's no address to the note.''
Dolbin knew. He had not merely sent the piano; but had written
note to Mrs. Sedley, and asked permission to come and see her,-and he
had seen her, and Amelia too, yesterday, before hc cme down to Chatham;
and, what is more, he had brought the farewell letter and packet which
and so moved them.
he good-natured fellow had found Mrs. Oracle only too willing to
receive him, and greatly agitated by the arrival of the piano, which, as she'
conjectured, uat have come from George, and was a signal of enmity on
his part. Captain Dolbin did not correct this error of the worthy lady,
but listened to all her story of complaints and misfortunes with great syn-
path-condoned with her losses and privations, and agreed in reprchending
the cruel conduct of Mr, Osborne towards his first benefactor. When she
had used her overflowing bosom somewhat, and poured forth many of her
sorrows, he had the courage to ask actually to sec Amelia, who was above
in her room as usual, and whom her mother led trembling down stairs.
Her appearance was so ghastly, and her look of despair so pathetic,
that ones William Dobbin wvas frightened as he yelled it; and real the
most fatal forcbodings in that plea fixed face. After sitting in his com-
many a minute or two, she put the packet into his hand, and said, `` Ttc
this to Captain Osborne, if you please, and-and I hope he's quite well-
and it was very kind of you to come and see us-and we like our new
house very much. And I-I think I'll go up-stairs, Mamma, for i'm not
very strong.'' And with this, and a curtscy and a smile, the poor child
went her way. The mother, as she led her up, cast back looks of anguish
towards Dobbin. The good fellow wanted no such appeal. IIe lord hcr
himself too foully for that. Inexprcssibla grief, and pity, ani terror
pursue him, and he came away as if he was a criminal after seeing her.
When Osborne heard that his friend and found her, he mle hot and
anxious inquiries regarding the poor child. How was she2 IIow did
he look What did she say?' His comrade took his hand, and looked
him in the face.
George, she's dying,'' William Dobbin said,-and could speak no
more.
There was a buxom Irish servant-girl, who performed all the duties of
the little house where the Sedley family had found refuge; and this girl
had in vain, on many previous days, striven to give Amelia aid or condo-

the attempts the other was making in her favour.
Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne, this servant-
said came into Amelia's room, where she sate as usual, brooding silently
over ler letters-her little treasures. The girl, smiling, and looking arch
and happy, made many trials to attract poor LEmmy's attention, who,
however, took no heed of her.

I'm coming,'' Emmy said, not looking round.
There's a message,'' the maid went on. ` There's something-some-

`I must see you,'' the letter said. ` Dearest Emmy-dearest loe-

George and her mother were outside, waiting until she had read the
letter.

E has seen how Mrs. Firkin,
the lady's said, as soon as
any event of importance to
the Crawley family came to
her knowledge, felt bound to
communicate it to Mrs. Bute
Crawley, at theReetory; and
have before mentioned how
particularly kind and attend-
tive that good-natured lady
was to Miss Crawley's confi-
dental servant. She had
been a gracious friend to
Mrs. Briggs, the companion,
also; and had secured the
latter's good will by a num-
ber of those attentions and
promises, which cost so little
in the making, and are yet so
valuable and agreeable to
the recipient. Indeed every
good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap
and yet how amiable these professions are, and what a flavour they give to
the most homely dish in life. Who was the blundering idiot who said
that '`fine words butter no parsnips?'' Half the parsnips of society are
served and rendered palatable with no other sauce. As the immortal
Alexis Sober can make more delicious song for a halfpenny than an
ignorant cook cn concoct with pounds of vegetables and meat, so a skilful
artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so
much substantial benefit-stock in the hands of a mere bungler. Nay, we
know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs; whereas, most
will digest any amount of fine words, and be always eager for more of the
same food. Mrs. Bute hal told Briggs and Firkin so often of the depth
of her affection for the; and what she would do if she had Miss Crawley's
fortune for friends so excellent and attached, that the ladies in question
had the deepest regard for her; and felt as much gratitude and confidence
as if Mrs. Bute lad loaded them with the most expensive favours.
Rawdon Crawley, on the other hand, like a selfish heavy dragoon as he
was, never took the least trouble to conciliate his aunt's aides-de-camp,
showed his contempt for the pair with entire frankness-made Firkin pull
off his boots on one occasion-sent her out in the rain on ignominious

message-and if he gave her a guinea, flung it to her as if it were a box
on the ear. As his Aunt, too, made a butt of Briggs, the Captain followed
the example and levelled his jokes nt her-jokes about as delicate as a
kick from his charger. Whereas, Mrs. Bute consulted her in matters of
taste or difficulty, admired her poetry, and by a thousand acts of kindness
and politeness, showed her appreciation of Briggs; and if she made Firkin
a twopenny-halfpenny present, accompanied it with so many compliments,
that the two-pence-halfpenny was transmuted into gold in the heart of
the grateful waiting-maid, who, besides, was looking forwards quite con-
entirely to some prodigious benefit which must happen to her on the day
when Mrs. Bute came in to her fortune.
The different conduct of these two people is pointed out respectfully to
the attention of persons commencing the world. Praise everybody, I say
to such: neer be squeamish, but speak out your compliment both point-
blank in a man's face, and behind his back, when you know there is a
reasonable chance of his hearing it again. Never lose a chance of saying a
kind word. As Collingwood never saw a vacant place in his estate but he
took un acorn out of his pocket and popped it in; to deal with your come
patients through life. An acorn costs noting; but it may sprout into a
prodigious bit of timber.
In a word, during Rawdon Crawley's prosperity, he was only obeyed with
sulky acquicscence; when his disgrace come, there was nobody to help or
pity him. Whereas, when Mrs. Bute took the command at Miss Crawley's
house, the garrison there were charmed to act under such a leader, ex-
pecting all sorts of promotion from her promises, her generosity, and her
kind words.
That he would consider himself beaten, after one defeat, and make no
attempt to regain the position he had lost, Mrs. Bute Crawley never
allowed herself to suppose. She knew Rebecca to be too clever and
spirited, and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle; and felt
that she must prepare for that combat, and be incessantly watchful against
assault, or nine, or surprise.
In the first place, though she held the town, was she sure of the pain-
cipal inhabitants Would Miss Crawley herself hold out; and and she
not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted adversary The old lady
like Rawdon, and Rebecca, who amused her. Mrs. But could not dis-
guise from herself the fact that none of her party could to contribute to
the pleasures of the town-bred lady. ` My girls' singing, after that little
odious governess's, I know is unbearable,'' the candid rector's wife owned
to herself. t She always used to go to sleep when MArtha and Louisa
played their ducts. Jim's stiff college manners and poor der Bute's talk
about his dogs and horses always annoyed her. 1f I took her to the
Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, an fly, I know she would;
and might fall into that horrid Rawdon's clutches again, and be the victim
of that little viper of a Sharp. Meanwhile, it is clear to me that she is
exceedingly unwell, and cannot move for some weeks, at any rate; during
which we must think of some plan to protect ler iro the arts of those
unprinciplel people.''
In the very best of moments, if anybody told Miss Crawley that she

was, or looked ill, the trembling old lady sent of for her doctor; and I
daresay she was very unwell after the sudden family event, which might
serve to shake stronger nerves than hers. At least, Mrs. Bute thought it
was her duty to inform the physician, and the apothecary, and the dame-
de-compagnie, and the domestic, that Miss Crawley was in a most critical
state, and that they were to act accordingly. She had the street laid knee-
deep with straw; and the knocker put by with Mr. Bowls's plate. She
insisted that the Doctor should call twice a day; and deluged her patient
with draughts every two hours. When anybody entered the room, she
uttered a alaslslsh so sibilant and ominous, that it frightened the poor old
lady in her bed, from which she could not look without seeing Mrs. Bute's
beady eyes eagerly fixed on her, as the latter sat steadfast in the arm-chair
by the bed-side. They seemed to lighten in the dark (for she kept the

curtains closed) as she moved about the room on velvet paws like a cat.
There Miss Crawley lay for days-ever so many days-Mrs. Bute reading
books of devotion to her : for nights, long nights, during which she had to
hear the watchman sing, the night-light sputter ; visited at midnight, the
last thing, by the stealthy apothecary; and then left to look at Mrs. Bute's
twinkling eyes, or the flicks of yellow that the rushlight threw on the
dreary darkened ceiling. NIgeria herself would have fallen sick under such

it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death, and an utter
cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner.
Sick-bed homilies and pious elections are, to be sure, out of place in
mere story-books, and we are not going (after the fashion of some novelists
of the present day) to cajole the public into a sermon, when it is only a
comedy that the reader pays his money to witness. But, without preach-
in, the truth may surely be borne in mind, that the bustle, and triumph,
and laughter, and piety which Vanity Fir exhibits in public, do not
always pursue the performer into private life, and that the most dreary
depression of spirits and dismal repentance sometimes overcome him.
Recollection of the best ordained banquets will scarcely cheer sick epicurus.
reminiscences of the most becoming dresses and brilliant bull triumphs
will go very little way to console faded beauties. Perhaps statesmen, at a
particular period of existence, are not much gratified at thinking over the
most triumphant divisions; and the success of the pleasure of yesterday
become of very small account when a certain (albeit uncertain) morrow is
in view, about which all of us must some day or other be speculating. O
brother wearers of motley Are there not moments when one grows sick
of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells This, dear
friends and companions, is my amiable object-to walk with you through
the Fair, to examine the shops and the shows there; and that we should
all come home after the flare, and the noise, and the gaiety, and bc
perfectly miserable in private.
If that poor man of mine had a head on his shoulders,'' Mrs. Bute
Crawley thought to herself, `` how useful he might be, under present cir-
stances, to this unhappy old lady He might make her repent of her
shocking free-thinking ways; he might urge her to do her duty, and cast
off that odious reprobate who has disgraced himself and his family ; and
he might induce her to do justice to my dear girls and the two boys, who
require and deserve, I am sure, every assistance which their relatives can
give them.''
And, as the hatred of vice is always a progress towards virtue, MIrs.
Bute Crawley endeavored to instil into her sister-in-law a proper abhor-
rcnce for all Rawdon Crawley's manifold sins: of which his uncle's wife
brought forward such a catalogue as indeed would have served to condemn
a whole regiment of young officers. If a man has committed wrong in life,
I don't know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the
world than his own relations; so Mrs. lUte showed a perfect family
interest and knowledge of rawdon's history. She had all the particulars
of that ugly quarrel with Captain Firebrnce, in which Rawdon, wrong from
the beginning, ended in shooting the Captain. She knew how the un-
happy Lord Moveable, whose mnmma has taken a house at Oxford, so that
he might be educated there, and who had never touched a card in his life
till he came to London, was perverted by Rawdon at the Cocoa Tree, made
helplessly tipsy by this abominable seducer and perverted of youth, and
fleeced of four thousand pounds. She described with the most vivid
finiteness the agonies of the country families whom he had ruined-the
sous whom he had plunged into dishonour and poverty-the daughters
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HER0.
165
whom he had inveigled into perdition. She knew the poor tradesmen
who were bankrupt by his extravagance-the mean shifts and robberies
with which he had ministered to it-the astounding falseloods by which
he had imposed upon the most generous of aunts, and the ingratitude and
ridicule by which he had repaid her sacrifices. She imparted these stories
gradually to Miss Crawley; gave her the whole benefit of them; felt it to
be her bounded duty as a Christian woman and mother of a family to do
so; had not the smallest remorse or compunetion for the victim whom her
tongue was violating; nay, very likely thought her act was quite mere-
torious, and plume herself upon her resolute manner of performing it.
as, if a man's character is to be abused, say what you will, there'as
nobody like a relation to do the business. And one is bound to own,
regarding this unfortunate wretech of a Ranwdon Crawley, that the mer
truth was enough to condemn him, and that all inventions of scandal were
quite superfluous pains on his friends' parts.
Rebecca, too, being on a relative, came in for the fullest shure of Mrs.
Bute's kind inquiries. This indetfatigble pursuer of truth (having given
strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissaries or letters
from Rnwdon), took Miss Crawley's carriage, and drove to her old friend
Miss Pinkerton, at Minerva House, Chiswick Mall, to whom she announced
the dreadful intelligence of Captain Rawdon's seduction by Miss Sharp,
and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the ex
governess's birth and early history. The friend of the Lexicographer had
plenty of information to give. Miss Jemima was male to fetch thc draw-
in-master's receipts and letters. This one was from a spunging-house:
that entreated an advance: another was full of gratitude for Rebecca's
reception by the ladies of Chiswick: and the last document from the
unlucky artist's pen was that in which, from his dying bed, e recom-
mended his orphan child to Miss Pinkerton's protection. There were
juvenile letters and petitions from Rebecca, too, in the collection, imploring
aid for her father, or declaring her own gratitude. Perhaps in Vanity Fair
there are no better satires than letters. Take a bundle of your dear

From Miss Pinkerton's the indefatigable Mrs. Bute followed the track
of Sharp and his daughter back to the lodgings in Greek Street, with

the defunct painter had occupied ; and where portraits of the landlady in
white satin, and of the husband in brass buttons, done by sHarp in lieu of
n quarter's rent, still decorated the parlour walls. Mrs. Stokes was a
communicative person, and quickly told all she knew about Mr. Sharp;
how dissolute and poor he was; how good-natured and amusing; how he
was always hunted by bailiffs and duns; how, to the landlady's horror,
though she neer could able the woman, he did not marry his wife still a
short time before her death; and what a queer little wild vixen his daughter
was; how she kept them all laughing with her fun and mimicry; how she
used to fetch the in from the public-house, and was now in all the
studios in the quarter-in brief, Mrs. Bute got such a full account of her
new niece's parentage, education, and behaviour as would scarcely have
pleased Rebecca, had the latter known that such inquiries were being made
concerning her.
Of all these industrious researches Miss Crawley had the full benefit.
Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was the daughter of an opera girl. She had danced
herself. She had been a model to the painters. She was brought up as
became her mother's daughter. She drank in with her father, &e. kc.
It was a lost woman who was married to a lost man; and the moral to
be inferred from Mrs. Bute's tale was, that the slavery of the pair was
irremediable, and that no properly-conducted person should ever notice
them again.
These were the materials which prudent MIrs. Bute gathered together
in Park Lane, the provisions and ammunition as it were with which she
fortified the house against the siege which she knew that Rawdon and his
wife would lay to Miss Crawley.
But if an fault may be found with her arrangements, it is this, that she
was too eager: she managed rather too well; undoubtedly she made Miss
Crawley more ill than was necessary; and though the old invalid suc-
cube to her authority, it was so harassing and severe, that the victim
would be inclined to escape at the very first chance which fell in her way.
Managing women, the ornaments of their sex,-women who order every-
thing for everybody, and know so much better than any person concerned
what is good for their neighbours, don't sometimes speculate upon the
possibility of a domestic revolt, or upon other extreme consequences
resulting from their overstrained authority.
Thus for instance Mrs. But, with the best intentions no doubt in the
world, and wearing herself to death as she did by foregoing sleep, dinner,
fresh air, for the sake of her inside sister-in-law, carried her conviction of
the old lady's illness so far that she almost managed her into her coffin.
She pointed out her sacrifices and their results one day to the constant
apotheecary, Mr. Clump.
I am sure, my dear Mr. Clump,'' she said, '`no efforts of mine have
been wanting to restore our dear invalid, whom the ingratitude of her
nephew has laid on the bed of sickness. I never shrink from personal
discomfort: I never refuse to sacrifice myself.''
Your devotion, it must be confessed, is admirable,'' Mr. Clump says,
with a low bow; `` but--''

humbly trust that my principles are good,'' Mrs. Bute said, with a happy
solemnity of conviction; ``and, as long as Nature supports me, never,
never, Mr. Clump, will I desert the post of duty. Others may bring that
gray heal with sorrow to the bed of sickness, (ere Mrs. Bute, waving her
hand, pointed to one of old Miss Crawley's coffee-coloured fronts, which
was perched on a stand in the dressing-room), but I will never quit it.
Ah, Mr. Clumps I fear, I know, that that couch needs spiritual as well as
medical consolation.''
What I was going to observe, my dear Malam,''-here the resolute
Clump once more interposed with u bland air-``what I was going to
observe when you gave utterance to sentiments which do you so much
honour, was that I think you alarm yourself needlessly about our kind
friend, and sacrifice your own health too proximally in her favour.''
I would lay down my life for my duty, or for any member of my
husband's family,'' Mrs. Bute interposel.
 Yes, Madam, if need were; but we don't want Mrs. Bute Crawley to
be a martyr,'' Clump sail gallantly. Dr. Squills and myself have both
considered Miss Crawley's case with every anxiety and car, as you may
suppose. We see her low-spirited and nervous; family events have agi-
stated her''
 Her nephew will come to perdition,'' Mrs. Crawley cried.

Madam, a positive guardian angel, I assure you, to soothe her under
the pressure of calamity. But Dr. Squills and I were thinking that our
amiable friend is not in such a state as renders confinement to her bed
necessary. Sle is depressed, but this confinement perhaps adds to her
depression. She should have change, fresh air, piety; the most delight-
ful remedies in the pharmacopoeia,'' Mr, Clump sil, grinding and showing
his handsome teeth. Persuade her to rise, dear Madam; drag her from
her couch and her low spirits; insist upon her team little drives. hey
will restore the roses too to your checks, if I may so speak to Mrs. lUte
Crawley.''
The sight of her horrid nephew casually in the Park, where I am told
the wretch drives with the brazen partner of his crimes,'' Mrs. Bute said,
(getting the cat of selfishness out of the bag of secrecy), ``would cause her
such a shock, that we should have to bring her back to bed again. She
must not go out, Mr. Clump. She shall not go out as long as I remain
to watch over her. And as for any health, what matters it? I give it
cheerfully, Sir. I sacrifice it at the altar of my duty,''
 Upon my worl, Mind,'' Mr. Clump now said bluntly, I won't
answer for her life if she remains locked up in that dark room. She is so
nervous that we may lose her any day; and if you wish Captain Crawley
to be her heir, I warn you frankly, Malam, that you are doing your very
best to see him.''

why, Mr. Clump, did you not inform me sooner2''
he night before, Mr. Clump and Dr. Squills had had a consultation (over
 bottle of wine at the house of Sir Latin Warren, whose lady was about
to present him with a thirteen blessing), regarding Niss Crawley and
her cse.
What a little harpy that woman from Hampshire is, Clump,'' Squills
remarked, `` that has seized upon old Tilly Crawley. Devilish good
Madeira.''
e What a fool Rawdon Crawley has been,'' Clump replied, ``to go and
marry a governess There was something about the girl, too,''
 Green eyes, fair skin, pretty figure, famous frontal development,''
Squills remarked. There is something about her; and Crawley was a
fool, Squills.''

Of course the old girl will fling him over,'' said the physician, and
after a pause added, ` She'll cut up well, I suppose,''
Cut up,'' says Clump with a grin; ` I wouldn't have her cut up for
two hundred a year.''

Bute and made more than one assault upon her, to induce her to alter her
will. But Miss Crawley's usual terrors regarding death increased greatly
when such dismal propositions were made to her, and MIrs. ROute saw that
she must get her patient into cheerful spirits and health before she could
hope to attain the pious object which she had in view. Whither to take
her was the next puzzle. The only place where she is not likely to meet
those odious Rawdon is at church, and that won't amuse her, MIrs. Bute
justly felt, : We must go and visit our beautiful suburbs of London,''
she then thought. I hear they are the most picturesque in the world;''
and so she had a sudden interest for Hampsteud, and Hornsey, and found
that Dulwich had great charms for her, and getting her victim into her
carriage, drove her to those rustic spots, beguiling the little journeys with
conversations about Rawdon and his wife, and telling every story to the
old lady which could add to her indignation against this pair ofreprobates.
Perhaps Mrs. Bute pulled the string unnecessarily tight. For though
she worked upn Miss Crawley to a proper dislike of her disobedient nephew,
the invalid had a great hatred and secret terror of her victimized, and
panel to escape from her. After a brief space, she rebelled against High-
gute and Journey utterly. She would go into the Park. MIrs. Bute knew
they would meet the abominable Rawdon there, and she was right. One
day in the ring, Rawdon's stanhope came in sight; Greece was seated by
him. In the enemy's equipage Miss Crawley occupied her usual place,

with Mrs. Bute on her left, the poodle and Miss Briggs on the back seat.
It was a nervous moment, and quebec's heart beat quick as she recognised
the carriage; and as the two vehicles crossed each other in the line, she
clasped her hands, and looked towards the spinster with n free of agonised
attachment and devotion. Rnwdon himself tremble, and his face grew.

other carriage, and cast her great eyes nervously towards her old friends.
Miss Crawley's comet was resolutely turned towards the argentine. MIrs,
Bute happened to be in ecstatic with the poodle, and was calling him a
little darling, and a sweet little boggy, and a pretty pet. The carriages
moved on, each in his line.
 Done, by Jove,'' Rawdon said to his wife.
 Try once more, Rawdon,'' Rebecca answered, '`Could not you look your
wheels into theirs, dearest ''
Rawdon had not the heart for that manure. When the carriages
met again, he stood up in his stanhope; he raised his hand ready to off
his hat; he looked with all his eyes. But this time Miss Crowley's face
was not turned away; she and MIrs. Bute looked him full in the face, and
cut their nephew tirelessly. He sank back in his sent with an oath, and
striking out of the ring, dashed away desperately homewards.
It was a gallant and deed triumph for Mrs. lUte. bUt she felt the
danger of many such meetings, as she saw the evident nervousness of Miss
Crawley; and she determined that it was most necessary for her denr

liamDobbin found himself the great
promoter, arranger, and manager of
the match between George Osborne
and Amelia. But for him it never
would have taken place: he could
not but confess as much to himself,
and smiled rather bitterly ns he
thought that he of all men in the
world should be the person upon
whom the care of this marriage had
fallen. But though indeed the con-
educating this negotiations about
as painful a task as could be set to
him, yet when he had a duty to
perform, Captain Dobbin was accuse-
timed to go through it without
many words or much hesitation;
and, having made up his mind completely, that if Miss Sedley was balked
of her husband she would die of the disappointment, he was determined to
use all his best endeavours to keep her alive.
I forbeuar to enter into minute particulars of the interview between
George and Amelia, when the former was brought back to the feet (or
should we venture to say the arms) of his young mistress by the inter-
mention of his friend honest William. A much harder heart than George's
would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly ravaged by
grief and despair, and at the simple tender accents in which she told her
little broken-hearted story: but as she did not faint when her mother,
trembling, brought Osborne to her; and as the only gae relief to her
oercharged grief, by laying her head on her lover's shoulder and there
weeping for a while the most tender, copious, and refreshing tears-old
Mrs. Selley, too greatly relieved, thought it was best to leave the young
persons to themselves; and so quieted Emmy crying over George's hand,
and kissing it humbly, as if it were her supreme chief and master, and as
if she were quite a guilty and unworthy person needing every favour and
grace from him.
This prostration and sweet unrepining obedience exquisitely touched
and flattered George Osborne. He saw a slave before him in that simple
yielding faithful creature, and his soul within him thrilled secretly some-
how at the knowledge of his power. He would be generous-minded,
Sultan as he was, and raise up this kneeling Esther and make a queen of

her : besides, her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her sub-
mission, and so he cheered her, and raised her up and forgave her, so to
speak. All her hopes and feelings, which were dying and withering, this
her sun having been removed from her, bloomed again and at once, its light
being restored. You would scarcely have recognised the beaming little
face upon Amelia's pillow that night as the one that was laid there the
night before, so was, so lifeless, so careless of all round about. The
honest Irish maid-servant, delighted with the change, asked leave to
kiss the face that had grown all of a sudden so rosy. Amelia put her
arms round the girl's neck and kissel her with all her heart, like a child.
She was little more. She had that night a sweet refreshing sleep, like
one-and what a spring of inexpressible happiness as she woke in the
morning sunshine
He will be here again to-any,'' Amelia thought.  He is the greatest
and bestow men.'' And the fact is, that George thought he was one of the
generousest creatures alive: and that he was making a tremendous
sacrifice in marrying this young creature.
While she and Osborne were having their delightful tete-a-the above
stairs, old Mrs. Sedley and Captain Dobbin were conversing flow upon
the state of the affairs, and the chances and future arrangements of the
young people. Mrs. Sedley having brought the two lovers together and
left them embracing each other with all their might, like a true woman,
was of opinion that no power on earth would induce Mr, Sedlcy to consent
to the match between his daughter and the son of a man who had so
shamefully, wickedly, and monstrously tretel him. ANd she told a long
story about happier days and their earlier splendour, when Osborne lived
in a very humble way in the New Road, and his wife was too had to
receive some of Jos's little baby things, with which Mrs. Sedley above-
modated her at the birth of one of Osborne's own children. The fiendish
ingratitude of that man, she was sure, had broken Mr. S.'s heart: and as
for a marriage, he would never, never, ever, never consent.
 They must run away together, Mla'am,'' Dobbin said, laughing, '`'and
follow the example of Captain Rawdon Crawley, and Miss Emmy's friend
the little governess,'' Was it possible? Well sle never Mrs. Sedley
was all excitement about this news. She wished that Blenkinsop were
here to hear it : Blenkinsop always mistrusted that Miss Sharp.-What an
escape Jos and had and she described the already well-known love-
passages between Rebecca and the Collector of Boggleywollh.
It was not, however, Mr. Selley's wrath which Dobbin feared, so much
as that of the other parent concerned, and he owned that he had a very
considerable doubt and anxiety respecting the behaviour of the black-
hrowed old tyrant of a Russia merchant in russell Square. IIe has for-
biden the match peremptorily Dobbin thought. He knew what u savage
determined man Osborne was, and how he stuck by his word. The only
chance George has of reeoncilement,'' argued his friend, `` is by distinguish-
ing himself in the coming campaign. If he dies they both go together. If
he fils in distinction-what then He has some money from his mother,
I have heard-enough to purchase his majority-or he must sell out and
go and dig in Canada or rough it in a cottage in the country,'' With such

a partner Dobbin thought he would not mind Siberia-and, strange to say,
this absurd and utterly imprudent young fellow never for a moment con-
sidered that the want of means to keep a nice carriage and horses, and of
an income which should enable its possessors to entertain their friends
generally, ought to operate as bars to the union of George and Miss Sedley.
It was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the
marriage should take place as quickly as possible. Was he anxious him-
self, I wonder, to have it over?-as people, when dental has occurred, like
to press forward the funeral, or when a parting is resolved upon, hasten it.
It is certain that Mr, Dobbin, having taken the matter in and, was most
extraordinarily eager in the conduct of it. He urged on George the
necessity of immediate action : he showed the chances of reconciliation
with his father, which a favourable mention of his name in the Gazette
must bring about. If need were he would go himself and brue both the
father in the business. At all events, he besought George to go through
with it before the orders came, which everybody expected, for the
departure of the regiment from England on foreign service.
Bent upon these hymeneal projects, and with the applause and consent
of Mrs, Sedley, who did not care to break the matter personally to her
husband, Mr. Dobbin went to seek John Sedley at his house of call in the
City, the Tapioca Coffee-house, where, since his own offices were shut up,
and fate had overtaken him, the poor brown-own old gentleman used to
retake himself daily, and write letters and receive them, and the the u
into mysterious bundles, several of which he carried in the laps of his coat.
I don't know anything more dismal than that business and bustle and
mystery of a ruined man: those letters from to wealthy which he shows
you: those worn greasy documents promising support and hollering con-
violence which he plans wi.-fully before to, and on which he builds his
hopes of restoration md litre fortune. My beloved reader has no doubt
in the course of his experience been waylaid by many such a reckless com-
anion. IIe takes you into the corner; he has his bundle of papers out
of his gaping coat pocket ; and the tape off, and the string in his mouth,
and the favourite letters elected and laid before you; and to docs to
know the sad eager half-crazy look which he fixes on you with his
hopeless eyes
Changed into a man of this sort, Dobbin found the once florid, jovial,
and prosperous John Selley. IIis coat, that used to be so glossy and trim,
was white at the seams, and the buttons showed the copper. His face
had fallen in, and was unshorn ; his frill and neckcloth hung limp under
his bagging waisteost. When he used to treat the boys in old days at a
oofee-house, he would shout and laugh louder than anybody there, and
have all the waiters skipping round him; it was quite painful to see how
humble and civil he was to John of the Tapioca, a clear-eyed old attendant
in dingy stockings and cracked pumps, whose business it was to serve
glasses of wafers, and bumpers of ink in pewter, and slices of paper to the
frequencies of this dreary house of entertainment, where nothing else
seemed to be consumed.  As for William Dobbin, whom he had tipped
repeatedly in his youth, and who had been the old gentleman's but on a
thousand occasions, old Sedley gave his hand to him in a very hesitating

humble manner now, and called him ``Sir.'' A feeling of shame and remorse
took possession of William Dobbin as the broken old man so received and
addressed him, as if he himself had been somehow guilty of the minor-
tunes which had brought Sedley so low.
I am very glad to see you, Captain Dobbin, Sir,'' says he, after a
hulking look or two at his visitor (whose lanky figure and military appear-
ance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the clear eyes of the
water in the cracked dancing pumps, and awakened the old lady in black,
who loved among the mouldy old coffee-cups in the bar). ` How is the
worthy alderman, and my lady, your excellent mother, Sir'' He looked
round at the winter as he said, ``My lady,'' as much as to say, '`Hark ye,
John, I have friends still, and persons of rank and reputation, too.'' Are
you come to do anything in my way, sir My young friends Dale and
Bpiggot do all my business for me now, until my new offices are ready
f6r I'm only here temporarily, you know, Captain. What can we do for
you, sir Will you like to take anything''
Dobbin, with a great lel of hesitation and stuttering, protested that
he was not in the least hungry or thirsty; that he had no business to
transact; that he only came to ask if Mr. Sedley was well, and to shake
hands with an old friend; and, he added, with a desperate perversion of
truth, `` My mother is very well-that is, she's been very unwell, and is
only waiting for the first five day to go out and call upon Mrs. Sedley.
How is Mrs. Sedley, Sir I hope she's quite well,'' And here he paused,
reflecting on his own consummate hypocrisy; for the day was a fine, and
the sunshine as bright as it over is in Collin Court, where the Tapioca
Coffee-house is situated; and Mr. Dobbin remembered that he had seen
Mrs. Sedley himself only an hour before, having driven Osborne down to
Fulham in his gig, and left him there tete-a-te with Miss Amelia.
My wife will be very happy to see her ladyehip,'' Sedley replied,
pulling out his papers. : I'm a very kind letter here from your father,
Bir, and beg my respectful compliments to him. Lady D. will find us in
rather a smaller house then we were accustomed to receive our friends in;
but it's sun, and the change of air does good to my daughter, who was
suffering in town rather-you remember little lEmmy, Sir P-yes, suffering
a good deal.'' The old gentleman's eyes were wandering as he spoke,
and he was thinking of something else, as he sate strumming on his papers
and fumbling at the worn red tape.
You're a military man,'' he went on;`` I ask you, Bill Dobbin, could
any man ever have speculated upon the return of that Corsican scoundrel
from Elba When the allied sovereigns were here last year, and we gave
'em that dinner in the City, Sir, and we saw the temple of Concord, and
the fireworks, and the Chinese bridge in St. James's Park, could any
sensible man suppose that peace was'nt really concluded, after we'd
actually sung e Due for it, Sir I ask you, William, could I suppose
that the Emperor of Austria was a damned traitor-n traitor, and nothing
more I don't mince words-a double-faced infernal traitor and schemer,
who meant to have his son-in-law back all along. And I say that the
escape of Money from Elbe was a damned imposition and plot, Sir, in
which half the powers of Europe were concerned, to bring the funds down,

and to ruin this country. That 's why I'm here, William. That's why
my name 's in the Gazette. Why, Sir -because I trusted the Emperor of
Russia and the Prince Regent. Look here. Look at my papers. Look
what the funds were on the last of MInrch-what the French fives were
when I bought for the account. And what they're at now. There was
collusion, Sir, or that villain never would have escaped. Where was the
English Commissioner who allowed him to get away? He ought to be
shot, Sir-brought to a court-martial, and shot, by Jove.''
 We're going to hunt Boney out, Sir,'' Dobbin said, rather alarmed at
the fury of the old man, the veins of whose forehead began to swell, and
who sate drumming his papers with his clenched fist.  We are going to
hunt him out, Sir-the Duke 's in Belgium already, and we expect march-
in orders every day.''
`Give him no quarter. Bring back the villain's head, Sir. Shoot the
coward down, Sir,'' Sedley roared. I'd enlist myself, by -; but I'm
a broken old man-ruined by that damned scoundrel-and by a parcel of
swindling thieves in this country whom I made, Sir, and who are rolling
in their carriages now,'' he added, with a break in his voice.
Dobbin was not a little affected by the sight of this one kind old friend,
crazed almost with misfortune and raving with senile unger. Pity the
fallen gentleman: you to whom money and fair repute are the chiefest
good; and so, surely, are they in Vanity Fair.
 Yes,'' he continued, '` there are some vipers that you warm, and they
sting you afterwards. There are some beggars that you put on horseback,
and they 're the first to ridley down. on know whom I ean, William
Dobbin, my boy. I mean a purse-proud villain in Russell Square, whom
I knew without a shilling, and whom I pray and hope to see a beggar as
he was when I befriended him.''
I have heard something of this, Sir, from my friend George,'' Dobbin
said, anxious to come to his point.  The quarrel between you and his father
has cut in up a great deal, Sir. Indeed, I'm the bearer of a message
from him.''
O, that's your errand, is it?'' erie the old man, jumping up
e WHat l perhaps he consoles with me, does he Very kind of him, the
stiff-backed pig with his dignified airs and West-end swagger. He's
answering about my house, is he still: If my son had the courage of a
man, he'd shoot him. He's as big a villain as his father. I won't have
his name mentioned in my house. I curse the day that ever I let him into
it; and I'd rather see my daughter deal at my feet than married to him.''
His father's harshness is not George's fault, Sir. Your daughter's
love for him is as much your doing as his. Who are you, that you are to
play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will''
collect it's not his father that breaks the match of,'' old Sedley
cried out. It's I that forbid it. That family and mine are separated
for eer. I'm fallen low, but not so low as that: no, no. And so you
may tell the whole raec-son, and father, and sisters, and all,''
`It 's my belief, Sir, that you have not the power of the right to sep-
rate those two,'' Doing answered in a low voice; ``and that if you don't
give your daughter your consent, it will be her duty to marry without it.

There's no reason she should die or live miserably because you are wrong-
headed. To my thinking she 'as just as much married as if the banks had
been read in all the churches in London. And what better answer can
there be to Osborne's charges against you, as charges there are, than that
his son claims to enter your family and marry your daughter''
A light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old Sedley
as this point was put to him: but he still persisted that with his consent
the marriage between Amelia and George should never take place.
We must do it without,'' Dobbin suid, smiling, and told Mr. Sedley, as
he had told Mrs. Sedley in the day, before, the story of Rebecca's elopement
with Captain Crawley. It evidently amused the old gentleman. ` You're
terrible fellows, you Captains,'' said he, tying up his papers; and his face
wore something like a smile upon it, to the astonishment of the clear-
eyed waiter who now entered, and had never seen such an expression upon
Sedley's countenance since he had used the dismal coffee-house.
The idea of hitting his enemy Osborne such a blow soothed, perhaps,
the old gentleman : and, their colloquy presently ending, he and Dobbin
parted pretty good friends.

`My sisters say she has diamonds as big as pigeons' eggs,'' George said
laughing. ``How they must set off her complexion A perfect illumina-
tion it must be when her jewels are on her neck. Her jet-black hair is
as curly as Sambo's. I dare say she wore a nose-ring when she went to
eoart; and with a plume of feathers in her top-knot she would look a perfect
Belle Sauvage.''
George, in conversation with amelia, was rallying the appearance of a
3young lady of whom his father and sisters lad lately made the quaint-
knee, and who was an object of vast respect to the Russell Square family.
She was reported to have a don't know how many plantations in the West
Indies; a deal of money in the funds; and three stars to her name in

the East India stockholders' list. She had a mansion in Surrey, and a
house in Portland Place. The name of the rich West India heiress had
been mentioned with applause in the Morning Post. Mrs. Haggistoun,
Colonel Hggistoun's widow, her relative, `` chaperonel'' her, and kept her
house. She was just from school, where she had completed her education,
and George and his sisters had met her at an evening party at old Hulker's
house, Deonshire Place (Hulker, Bullock, & Co. were long the correspond-
dents of her house in the West Indies), and the girls had made the most
cordial advances to her, which the heiress had received with great good
humour. An orphan in her position-with her money-so interesting
the Misses Osborne said. They were full of their new friend when they
returned from the Hulker ball to Miss Wirt, their companion: they had
male arrangements for continually meeting, and had the carriage and
drove to see her the very next day. Mrs. IHaggistoun, Colonel Baggage-
town's widow, a relation of Lord Binkie, and always talking of him, struck
the dear unsophisticasted girls as rather haughty, and too much inclined to
talk about her great relations: but Rhoda was everything they could wish
--the franks, kindest, most agreeable creature-wanting a little polish,
but so good-natured. The girls Christian-named each other at once.
You should have seen her dress for court, Emmy,'' Osborne cried,
laughing. ' She came to my sisters to show it of, before she was pre-
seated in state by my Lady Binkie, the Haggistoun's kinswoman. She'a
related to every one, that Haggistoun. Her diamonds blazed out like Vaux-
hall on the night we were there. (Do you remember Vauxhall, Emmy,
and Jos singing to his dearest middle middle darling) Diamonds and

feathers in her hair-I mean in her wool. he had ear-rings like change-
lies; you might have lighted 'em up, by Love-and a yellow satin train
that revealed after her like the tail of a comet.''
'How old is she'' asked Emmy, to whom George was rattling away
regarding this dark paragon, on the morning of their re-union-rattling
away as no other man in the world surely could.
Way, the Black Princess, though she has only just left school, must
be two or three and twenty. And you should see the hand she writes
Mrs. Colonel Haggistoun usually writes her letters, but in a moment of
confidence, she put pen to paper for my sisters; she spelt satin setting,
and Saint James's, aunt Jams.''
 Why, surely it must be Miss Starts, the parlour border,'' Emmy
said, remembering that good-natured young Mulatto girl, who had been
so hysterically affected when Amelia left Miss Pinkerton's academy.
The very nae,'' George said.  Her father was a Gorman Jew-s
slave-owner they say-connected with the Cannibal Islands in some way
or other. HE died last year, and Miss Pinkerton has finished her educa-
tion. Bc can play two pieces on the piano; she knows three songs; she
can write when Mrs. Haggistoun is by to spell for her; and Jane and
MInria already have got to love her as a sister.''

were always very cold to me.''
My dear child, they would have loved you if you had had two hundred

been brought up. Ours is a ready-only society. We live among

talks to you, is jingling his guineas in his pocket. There is that jackass
Fred Bullock, is going to marry Maria-there 's Gilmore, the East India
Director, there 's Ripley, in the tallow trade-our trade,'' George said,
with an uneasy laugh and a blush. ``Curse the whole pack of money-
grubbing bulgarians I fall asleep at their great heavy dinners. I feel
ashamed in my father's great stupid parties. I've been accustomed to live
with gentlemen, and men of the world and fashion, may, not with a
parcel of turtle-fed tradesmen. Dear little women, you are the only person
of our set who ever looked, or thought, or spoke like a lady: and you do
it because you 're an angel and can't help it. Don't remonstrate. you are
the only lady. Didn't Miss Crawley remark it, who has lies in the best
company in Europe And as for Crawley, of the Life Guards, hang it,
he 's a fine fellow: and I like him for marrying the girl he had chosen.''
Amelia admiral Mr. Crawley very much, too, for this; and trusted
Rebecca would be happy with him, and hoped (with a laugh) Jos would
be consoled. And so the pair went on rattling, as in quite carly days.
Amelia's confidence being perfectly restored to her, though she expressed
a great deal of pretty jealousy about Miss Swartz, and professed to be
dreadfully frightened-like a hypocrite as she was-left George should
forget her for the heiress and her money and her estates in Saint Kitts.
But the fact is, she was a great deal too happy to have fears or doubts or
misgivings of any sort: and having George at her side again, was not
afraid of any heiress or beauty, or indeed of any sort of danger.
When Captain Dobbin came back in the afternoon to these people-
which he did with a great deal of sympathy for them-it did his lent
good to see how Amelia had grown young again-how she laughed, and
chirped, and sang familiar old songs at the piano, which were only inter-
erupted by the bell from without proclaiming Mr. Sedley's return from the
City, before whom George received a signal to retreat.
Beyond the first smile of recognition-and even that was an hypocrisy,
for she thought his arrival rather provoking-Miss Selley did not once
notice Dobbin luring his visit. But he was content, so that he saw her
happy; and thankful to have been the means of making her so.

 at the West End, my dear Miss, at

- our humble mansion in Russell
square. My daughters are plain,
disinterested girls, but their hearts are in the right place, and they've con-
received an attachment for you which does them honour-I say, which does
them honour. I'm a plain, simple, humble British merchant-an honest

plain people, but a warm welcome, my dear Miss Rhoda-Rhoda, let me

like you. A glass of Champagne Hicks, Champagne to Miss Swartz.''
There is little doubt that old Oborne believed all he said, and that the
girls were quite earnest in their protestations of affection for Miss Swartz.
People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally. If the
simplest people are disposed to look not a little kindly on great Prosperity,

society. They give a loose to their feelings on proper occasions. And
the proof is, that the major part of the Osborne family, who had not, in
fifteen years, been able to get up a hearty regard for Amelia Sedley, became
as fond of Miss Swartz in the course of a single evening nus the most
romantic advocate of friendship at first-sight could desire.
What a match for George she'd be (the sister and Miss Wirt agreed),
and how much better than that insignificant little Amelia Such a
dashing young fellow as he is, with his good looks, rank, and accomplish-
ments, would be the very husband for her. Visions of balls in Portland
Place, presentations at Court, and introductions to half the peerage, filled
the minds of the young ladies; who talked of nothing but George and his
grand acquaintances to their beloved new friend.
Old Osborne thought she would be a great match, too, for his son. He
should leave the army; he should go into Parliament ; he should cut a
figure in the fashion and in the state. His blood boiled with honest
British exaltation, as he saw the name of Osborne ennoble in the person
of his son, and thought that he might be the progenitor of a glorious line
of bayonets. He worked in the City and on 'Change, until he knew
everything relating to the fortune of the heiress, how her money was
placed, and where her estates lay. oung Free Bullock, one of his chief
informants, would have liked to make a bid for her himself (it was so the
young banker expressed it), only he was booked to Marin Osborne. But
not being able to secure her as a wife, the disinterested Fred quita
approved of her as a sister-in-law. 'Let George cut in directly and win
her,'' was his advice. Strike while the iron's how, you know-while
he's fresh to the town; in a few weeks some d- fellow from the West
End will come in with a title and a rotten rent-roll and cut all us City
men out, as Lord Fitzrufus did last year with Miss Program, who was
actually engaged to Powder, of Powder & Brown's. The sooner it is done
the better, Mr. Osborne; them's my sentiments,'' the way said; though,
when Osborne had left the bank parlour, Mr. Bullock remembered Amelia,
and what a pretty girl she was, and how attached to George Osborne; and
he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuable time to regretting the
misfortune which had befallen that unlucky young woman.
WHile thus George Osborne'a good feelings, and his good friend and
genius, Dobbin, were carrying back the truant to Amelia's feet, George's
parent and sisters were arranging this splendid match for him, which they
never dreamed he would resist.
When the elder Osborne gave what he called ``a hint,'' there was no
possibility for the most obtuse to mistake his meaning. Hc called kicking
a footman down stairs, n hint to the latter to leave his service. With his
usual frankness and delicacy, he told Mrs. Haggistoun that he would give
her a check for ten thousand pounds on the day his son was married to
her word; and called that proposal a hint, and considered it a very des-
terous piece of diplomacy. He gave George finally such another hint
regarding the heiress; and ordered him to marry her out of hand, as he
would have ordered his butler to draw a cork, or his clerk to write a
letter.
THis imperative hint disturbed George a good deal. He was in th
 2

very first enthusiasm and delight of his second courtship of Amelia, which
was inexpressibly sweet to him. The contrast of her manners and appear-
ance with those of the heiress, made the idea of a union with the latter
appear doubly ludicrous and odious. Carriages and opera-boxes, thought
he; fancy being seen in them by the side of such a mahogany charmer as
that And to all, that the Junior Osborne was quite as obstinate as the
Senior: when he wanted a thing, quite as firm in his resolution to get
it; and quite as violent when angered, as his father in his most stern
Moments.
On the first day when his father formally gave him the hint that he was
to place his affections at Miss Swartz's feet, George temporised with the
old gentleman.  You should have thought of the matter sooner, Sir,''
he said. ` It can't be done now, when we're expecting every day to go
on foreign service. Wnit till my return, if I do return;'' and then he
represented, that the time when the regiment was daily expecting to quit
England, was exceedingly ill-chosen : that the few days a week during
which they were still to remain at home, mst be devoted to business and
not to love-making: time enough for that when he came home with his
majority; '` for, I promise you,'' suidhe, with n satisfied air, ``that one way
or other you shall read the name of George Oborne in the Gazette.''
The father's reply to this was founded upon the information which he
had got in the City: that the West End chaps would infallibly catch hold
of the heiress if any delay took place: that if he didn't marry Miss S., he
might at least have an engagement in writing, to come into effect when he
returned to England ; and that a man who could get ten thousand a year
by staying at home, was a fool to risk his life abroad.
So that you would have me shown up as a coward, Sir, and our name
lishonoured for the sake of Miss Swartz's money,'' George iuterposed.
This remark staggered the old gentleman; but as he had to reply to it,
and as his mind was nevertheless made up, he said, ` You will dine here
to-morrow, Sir, and every day Miss Swartz comes, you will be here to pay
your respects to her. If you want for money, call upon Mr. Chopper.''
Thus a new obstacle was in George's way, to interfere with his plans
regarding Amelia; and about which he and Dobbin had more than one
confidential consultation. 1Iis friend's opinion respecting the line of
conduct which he ought to pursue, we know already. And as for Osborne,
when he was once bent on a thing, a fresh obstacle or two only rendered
him the more resolute.
The dark object of the conspiracy into which the chiefs of the Osborne
family had entered, was quite ignorant of all their plans regarding her
(which, strange to say, her friend and chperon did not divulge), and,
taking all the young ladies' flattery for genuine sentiment, and being, as
we have before had occasion to show, of a very warm and impetuous
nature, responded to their affection with quite a tropical armour. And if
the truth may be told, I dare say that she too had some selfish attraction
in the Russell Square house; and in a word, thought George Osborne a
very nice young man. His whiskers had made an impression upon her,
on the very first night she beheld them at the ball at Messrs. lulkers; and,

A NOVEL WITHIN A HERO.
181
as we know, she was not the first woman who had been charmed by them.
George had an air at once swaggering and melancholy, languid and fierce.
He looked like a man who had passions, secrets, and private harrowing
griefs and adventures. His voice was rich and deep. Ie would say it
was a warm evening, or ask his partner to take an ice, with a tone as sad
and confidential as if he were breaking her mother's death to her, or pre-
luding a declaration of love. He trampled over all the young bucks of
his father's circle, and was the hero among those third-rate men. Some
few sneered at him and later him. Some, like Dobbin, fanatically
admired him. And his whiskers had begun to do their work, and to curl
themselves round the affections of Miss Swartz.
Whenever there was a chance of meeting him in Russell Square, that
simple and good-natured young woman was quite in a flurry to see her
dear Miss Osborne. She went to great expenses in new gowns, and
bracelets, and bonnets, and in prodigious feathers. She adorned ler
person with her utmost skill to please the Conqueror, and exhibited all
her simple accomplishments to win his favour. The girls would ask her,
with the greatest gravity, for a little music, and she would sing her three
songs and play her two little pieces as often as ever they asked, and with
an always increasing pleasure to herself. During these delectable enter-
tainments, Miss Wirt and the chapel ste by, and conned over the
peerage, and talked about the nobility
The day after George nhl his lion his father, and a short time
before the hour of dinner, he was rolling upon a sofa i the drawing-room
in a very becoming and perfectly natural attitude of melancholy. He had
been, at his father's request, to Mr. Chopper in the city, (the old gentle-
man, though he gave reat sums to his son, would never specify any fixed
allowance for lim, and rewarded him only as he was in the humour). Ile
had then been to pass three hours with Anglia, his denr little Amelia, at
Fulham; and he came home to find his sisters spread in searched muslin
in the drawing-room, the dowvagcrs working in the back-ground, and
honest Swartz in hcr favorite uber-poured satin, with turquoise-
bracelets, counties rings, lowers, teachers, and all sorts of tags and him-
cracks, about as elegantly decorated :s a se chimney-sweep on May day.
The girls, after vain attempts to cage him in conversation, talked
about fashions and the last drawing-room until he was perfectly sick of
their chatter. He contrasted their behavior with little Emmy's,-their
shrill cracked voices with her tender ringing tones; their attitudes and
their elbows and tli starch, with her humble soft movements and
modest graces. Poor Swartz was state in a place where Emmy had
been accustomed to sit. Her bejewelled ends lay sprawling in her amber
satin ip. `Her tags and ear-rings twinkled, and her big eyes rolled about.
he was doing nothing with perfect contentment, and thinking herself
charming. aNything so becoming as the santin the sisters had never seen.
``GRammy,'' George said to a confidential friend, `` she looked like a
China doll, which has nothing to do all day but to grin and was its
heal. By Jove, Will, it was all I could do to prevent myself from throwing
the sofa cushion at her,'' He restrained that exhibition of sentiment,
however.

O, Flee du Tage,'' Miss Maria cried; '' we have the song,'' and went
to fetch the book in which it was.
Nos it happened that this song, then in the height of the fashion, had
been given to the young ladies by a young friend of theirs, whose name was
on the title, and Miss Swartz, having concluded the ditty with George's
applause, (for he remembered that it was a favourite of Amelia's), was
hoping for an encore perhaps, and filing with the leaves of the music,
when her eye fell upon the title, and she saw ``Amelia Sedley'' written in
the corner.
`Lord'' tried Miss Swartz, spinning swiftly round on the music-stool.

``is it my aMericas Amelia that was not Miss P.'s at Hammersmith I

Don't mention her,'' MIss Marina Osborne said hastily.  Her family
' has disgraced itself. Her father cheated papa, and as for her, she is need
to be mentioned ere.'' This was Miss Maria's return for George's rude-
ness about the Battle of Prague.
''Are you a friend of Amelia's?'' George said, burning up. 'God
bless you for it, Miss Swartz. don't believe what the girls ssy. She's
not to blame at any rate. She's the best-''
you know you're not to speak about her, George,'' cried June. `' Pasta

 Who's to prevent me?'' George cried out. ``I will speak of her. I
say she's the best, the kindest, the gentlest, the sweetest girl in England;
and that, bankrupt or no, my sisters are not fit to hold candles to her.
If you like her, go and see her, Miss Swartz; she wants friends now;
and I say, God bless everybody who befriends her. Anybody who speaks
kindly of her is my friend; anybody who speaks against er is my enemy.
Thank you, Miss Swartz;'' and he went up and wrung her hand.
George George s'' one of the sisters cruel imploring.
I sy,'' George sid timely, ``I thank everybody ho loves Axis
ed-''.  He stopped. Old Osborne was in the room with a face livid with
rage, and eyes like hot vols.
Though George has stopped in his sentence, yet, his blood being up, he
was not to be cowed by all the generations of Osborne ; rallying instantly,
he replied to the bullying look of his father, with another so indicative of
resolution and defiance, that the elder man quailed in his turn, and looked
away. He felt that the tussle was coming. Mrs. kaggistoun, let me
take you down to dinner,'' he said. Give your arm to Miss Swartz,
George,'' and they marched.
Miss Swartz, I love Amelia, and we've been engaged almost all our
lies,'' Osborne sail to his partner; and during all the dinner, george
rattled on with a solubility which surprised himself, and made his father
doubly nervous, for the fight which was to take place as soon as the ladies
were gone.
The difference between the pair was, that while the father was violent
and a bully, the son had thrice the nerve and courage of the parent, and
could not merely make an attack, but resist it; and finding that the
mOment was now come when the contest between him and his father was
to be decided, he took his dinner with perfect coolness and appetite before
the engagement been. Old Osborne, on the contrary, was nervous, and
drank much. He floundered in his conversation with the ladies, his
neighbours; George's coolness only rendering him more angry. It made
him half mad to see the calm way in which George, flapping his napkin,
and with a swaggering bow, opened the door for the ladies to leave the
room; and filling himself a glass of wine, smacked it, and looked his father
full in the face, as if to say, ``' Gentlemen of the Guard, fire first.'' The
old man also took a supply of ammunition, but his decanter linked
against the glass as he tried to fill it.
Afer giving a great heave, and with a purple choking face, he then

Swartz to-day, in my drawing-room I ask you, in, how dare you do
it
`:Stop, Sir,'' says George, '`don't say dare, Sir. Dare isn't a word to
be used to a Captain in the British Army.''
I shall say what I like to my son, SIr. I can cut him of with a ship-
ling if I like. I can make him a beggar if I like. Will s what I like,''
the elder said.
I'm a gentleman though I am your son, Sir,'' George answered
haughtily. ``Any communications which you have to make to me, or
any orders which you may please to give, I beg may be couched in that
kind of language which I am accustomed to hear,''
Whenever the lad assumed his haughty manner, it always created either
great awe or great irritation in the parent. Old Osborne stood in secret
terror of his son as a better gentleman than himself; and perhaps my
readers may have remarked in their experience of this Vanity Fair of ours,
that there is no character which a low-minded man so much mistrust, as
that of a gentleman.
`My father didn't give me the education you have had, for the adhan-
tages you have had, for the money you have had. If I had kept the
company some folks have had through my mean, perhaps my son wouldn't
have any reason to brag, Dir, of his superior and West FEud airs (these
words were uttered in the elder Osborne's most sarcastic tones). But it
wasn't considered the part of a gentleman, in my time, for a man to insult
his father. If I'd done any such thing, mine would have kicked me
down stairs, Sir,''
`I neer insulted you, Sir. I said I begged you to remember your son
was a gentleman as well as yourself. I know very well that you give me
plenty of money,'' said George, (fingering a bundle of notes which he had
got in the morning from Mr. Chopper).  ou tell it me often enough,
ir. There's no fear of my forgetting it.''
I wish you'd remember other things as well, Sir,'' the sire answered.
tI wish you'd remember that in this house-so long as you choose to
honour it with your company, Captain-I'm the master, and that name,
and that that-that you-that I say-
:that what, Sir'' George asked, with scarcely a sneer, filling another
glass of claret.
'--1'' burst out his father with a screaming month-'` that the name
of those Sedleys never be mentioned here, Sir-not one of the whole

It wasn't I, Sir, that introduced Miss Sedley's name. It was my
sisters who spoke ill of her to Miss Swartz; and by Jove I'll defend her
whereverIgo. Nobody shall speak lightly of that name in my presence.
Our family has done her quite enough injury already, I think, and may
leave off reviving her now she's down. I'll shoot any man but you who

I obeyed you. And now that her heart 's mike you give me orders to fling

It's a shame, by Heavens,'' sid George, working himself up into passion
and enthusiasm as he proceeded, '` to play at fast and loose with a young
girl's affections-and with such an angel as that-one so superior to the

ENEMIES the most obstinate and cou-
ranges cnn't hold out against starve-
tion: so the elder Osborne felt himself
pretty easy about his adversary in the
encounter we have just described ; and
as soon as George's supplies fell
short, confidently expected his un-
conditional submission. It was in-
lucky, to be sure, that the law should
have secured a stock of provisions on
the very day when the first encounter
took place; but this relief was only
temporary, old Osborne thought, and
would but delay George's surrender.
No communication passed between
father and son for some days. The
former was sulky at this silence, but
not disquieted ; for, as he said, he knew where he could put the screw
upon George, and only waited the result of that operation. He told the
sisters the upshot of the dispute between them, but ordered them to take
no notice of the matter, and welcome George on his return as if nothing
had happened. His cover was laid as usual every day, and perhaps the
old gentleman rather anxiously expected him; but he never came. Some
one inquired at the Slaughter'as regarding him, where it was said that he
and his friend Captain Dobbin had left town.
One gusty, raw day at the end of April,-the rain whipping the
pavement of that ancient street where the old Slaughter's Coffee-house
was once situated,-George Osborne came into the coffee-room, looking
very haggard and pale; although dressed rather smartly in a blue coat
and brass buttons, and a neat buff waistcoat of the fashion of those days.
Here was his friend Captain Dolbin, in blue and brass too, having alan-
loved the military frock and French-grey browsers, which were the usual
coverings of his lanky person.
Dobbin had been in the coffee-room for an hour or more. He had
tried all the papers, but could not read them. He had looked at the
clock many scores of times; and at the street, where the rain was pattering
down, and the people as they linked by in patterns, left long reflections
on the shining stones: he tattooed at the table: he bit his nails most
completely, and nearly to the quick (he was accustomed to ornament his
great big hands in this way): he balanced the tea-spoon dexterouly on

the milk jug: upset it, &c. &c.; and in fact showed those signs of his-
tuietude, and practised those desperate attempts at amusement, which
men are accustomed to employ when very anxious, and expectant, and
perturbed in mind.
Some of his comrades, gentlemen who used the room, joked him about
the splendour of his costume and his agitation of manner. One asked
him if he was going to be married Dobbin laughed, and said he would
send his acquaintance (Major Wagstaff, of the Engineers) a piece of cake,
when that event took place. At length Captain Osborne made his appear-
ance, very smartly dressed, but very pale and agitated, as we have said.
Ie wiped his pale face with a large yellow bandnnna pocket-handkerchief
that was prodigiously scented. He shook hands with Dobbin, looked at
the clock, and told John, the water, to bring him some europa. Of this
cordial he swallowed off a couple of glasses with nervous engerness. His
friend asked with some interest about his health.
Couldn't get a win of sleep till daylight, Dob,'' said he.  Infernal
headache and fever. Got up at nine, and went down to the Hummus
for a bath. I say, Dob, I feel just as I did on the morning I went out

`So do I'' William responded. I was a deuce deal more nervous
than you were that morning. Kou made a famous breakfast, I remember.

You 're a good old fellow, Will,. I 'Il drink your health, old boy, and
farewell to--''
No, no; two glasses are enough,'' Dobbin interrupted him. ``Hero,
take away the liqueurs, JOhn. HAve some cayenne-pepper with your
fowl. Make haste though, for it is time we were there.''
It was about half-an-hour from twelve when this brief meeting and
colloquy took place between the two captains. A coach, into which Cn-
tain Osborne's servant put his master's desk and dressing-case, had been
in waiting for some time; and into this the two gentlemen hurried under
an umbrella, and the valet mounted on the box, cursing the rain and the
dampness of the coaching who was steaming beside him.  We shall
find a better trap than this at the church-door,'' says he; `` that's a com-
art.'' And the carriage drove on, taking the road down Piccadilly,
where Apsley House and St. George's Hospital wore red jackets still;
where there were oil-lamps; where Achilles was not yet born; nor the
Silicon arch raised; for the hideous equestria monster which pervades
it and the neighbourhood ;-and so they drove down by Brompton to a
certain chapel near the Fulham rond there.
A chariot was in waiting with four horses; likewise a coach of the kind
called glass coaches. Only a very few idlers were collected on account of
the dismal dismal rain.
Hang it'' said George, ``'I said only a pair,''
`My master would have four,'' said Mr. Joseph Selley's servant, who
was in waiting; and he and Mr. Osborne's men agreed as they followed
George and William into the church, that it was a ``reg'lar shabby turn
out ; and with scarce so much as a breakfast or a wedding favour,''
 Here you are,'' said our old friend, Jos Sedley, coming forward.

Y1CITY AIR.
 You 're five minutes late, George, my boy. What a day, hp Emmy,
it 's like the commencement of the rainy season in Bengal. But you'll
find my carriage is water-tight. Come along, my mother and Emmy are
in the vestry.''
Jos Sedley was splendid. He was faster than ever. His shirt collars
were higher ; his face was redder; his shirt-frill flaunted gorgeously out of
his variegated waistcoat. Varnished boots were not invented ns yet; but
the Hessians on his beautiful legs shone so, that they must have been the
identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture used to have
himself; and on his light green coat there bloomed a fine wedding favour,
like a great white spreading magnolia.
In a word, George had thrown the great cast. He was going to be
married. Hence his pallor and nervousness-his sleepless night and
agitation in the morning. I have heard people who have gone through
the same thing own to the same emotion. After three or four ceremonies,
you get accustomed to it, no doubt; but the first dip, every body allows,
is awful.
The bride was dressed in a brown silk precise, (as Captain Dobbin has
since informed me), and wore a straw bonnet with a pink ribbon: over the
bonnet she had a veil of white Chantilly lace, a gift from Mr. Joseph
Sedley, ler brother. Captain Dobbin himself had asked leave to present
her with a gold chain and teh, which she sported on this occasion ; and
her mother gave her her diamond brooch ; almost the only trinket which
was left to the old ludy. As the service went on, Mrs. Sedley sat and
whispered a great deal in a pew, consoled by the Irish maid servant and
Mrs. Clapp from the lodgings. Old Sedley would not be present. Jos
acted for his father, giving away the bride, whilst Captain Dobbin stepped
up s groom's-man to his friend George.
There was nobody in the church besides the officiating persons and the
small marriage party and their attendants. The two valets sat aloof
superciliously. The rain came rattling down on the windows. In the
intervals of the service you heard it, and the sobbing of old Mrs. Sedley
in the pew. The person's tones echoed sadly through the empty walls.
Osborne's I will'' was founded in very deep base. Emmy's response
came fluttering up to her lips from her heart, but was scarcely heard by
anybody except Captain Dobbin.
When the service was completed, Jos Sedley came forward and kissed
his sister, the bride, for the first time for many months-George's look of
gloom had gone, and he seemed quite proud and radiant. ` It 's your
turn, William,'' says he, putting his hand fondly upon Dobbin's shoulder;
and Dobbin went up and touched Amelia on the cheek.
Then they went into the vestry and signed the register. `` God bless
you, Old Dobbin,'' George si, grasping him by the hand, with something
very like moisture glistening in his eyes. William replied only by nodding
his head. His heart was too full to say much.
e Write directly, and come down as soon as you can, you know,''
Osborne sid. After Mrs. Sedley had taken an hysterical aden of her
daughter, the pair went off to the carriage. ` Get out of the way, you
little devils,'' George cried to a small crowd of dmp urchins, that were

groom's faces as they passed to the chariot. The postillions' favours
dragged on their dripping jackets. The few children made a dismal
cheer, as the carriage, splashing mud, drove nwny.
William Dobbin stood in the church-porch, looking at it, a queer figure.
The small crew of spectators jeered him. He was not thinking about
them or their laughter.
 Come home and have some tiffin, Dobbin,'' a voice cried behind him;
as a pudgy hand was laid on his shoulder, and the honest fellow's review
was interrupted. bUt the Captain had no heart to go a feasting with
Jos timely. e put the weeping old lady and her attendants into
the carriage along with Jos, and left them without any further words
passing. This carriage, too, drove away, and the urclins gae another
sareastical cheer.
Here, you little beggars,'' Dobbin said, giving some sixpences amongst
them, and then went off by himself through the rain. It was all over.
They were married, and happy, he prayed God. Never since he was a
boy had he felt so miserable and so lonely. He longed with a heart-sick
yearning for the first few days to be over, that he might see her again.
Some ten days after the above ceremony, three young men of our
acquaintance were enjoying that beautiful prospect of bow windows on
the one side and blue sea on the other, which Brighton affords to the
traveller. Sometimes it is towards the ocean-smiling with countless
dimples, speckled with white sails, with a hundred bathing-machines kiss-
in the skirt of his blue garment-that the Londoner looks enraptured:
sometimes, on the contrary, a lover of human nature rather than of pros-
pets of any kind, it is towards the bow windows that he turns, and
that swarm of human life which they exhibit. From one issue the notes
of a piano, which a young lady in ringlets prctises six hours daily, to the
delight of the fellow-lodgers: at another, lovely Polly, the nursemnid,
may be seen handling Master Omnium in her arms: whilst Jacob, his
pain, is bcheld eating prawns, and devouring the Times for breakfast, at
the window below. Yonder are the Misses Leery, who are looking out for
the young officers of the heaviest, who are pretty sure to be paying the
cliff; or again it is a City man, with a nautical turn, and a telescope, the
size of a six-pounder, who has his instrument pointed seawards, so as to
command every pleasure-boat, herring-boat, or bathing-machine that
comes to, or quits, the shore, &e., &c. But have we any leisure for a
description of Brighton -for Brighton, a clean Naples with genteel lanza-
roni-for Brighton, that always looks brisk, gy, anl gaudy, like a harle-
quinn's jacket-for Brighton, which used to be seven hours' distant from
London at the time of our story; which is now only a hundred minutes
off; and which may approach who knows how much nearer, unless Join-
ville comes and untimely bombards it

gEt away,'' said Jos Sedley, quite pleased, and leering up at the maid-
servant in question with a post killing ogle. Jos was even more splendid
nt Brighton than he had been at his sister's marriage. He had brilliant
under-waistcoats, any one of which would have set up a moderate buck.
He sported a military frock-coat, ornamented with frogs, knobs, black
buttons, and meandering embroidery. He had affected a military appear-
ance and habits of late; and he walked with his two friends, who were of
that profession, clinking his boot-spurs, swaggering prodigiously, and
shooting death-glances at all the servant girls who were worthy to be slain.
 What shall we do, boys, till the ladies return?'' the buck asked. The
allies were out to Rottingdean in his carriage, on a drive. ``Let 's have a
game at billiards,'' one of his friends said-the tall one, with lacquered
pistachios.
e No, dummy; no, Captain,'' Jos replied, rather unarmed.  No bil-
lizards to-day, Crawley, my boy; yesterday was enough,''
 You play very well,'' said Crawley, laughing. ``Don't he, Osborne%

 Famous,'' Osborne said. ` Jos is a devil of a fellow nt billiards, and
at everything else, too. I wish there were any tiger-hunting about here;
we might go and kill a few before dinner. (There goes a fine girl what
an angle, eh Jos2) Tell us that story about the tiger-hunt, and the way
you did for him in the jungle-it's a wonderful story that, Crawley.''
Here George Osborne gave a yawn. It 's rather slow work,'' said he,
'down here; what shall we do ''
 Shall we go and look at some horses that Snaffler 's just brought from
Lewes fair P'' Crawley said.
``Suppose we go and have some jellies at Dutton's,'' said the rogue Jos,
willing to kill two birds with one stone.  Devilish fine gl at Dutton's.''
Suppose we go and see the Lightning come in, it 's just about time2''
George said. This advice prevailing over the stables and the jelly, they
turned towards the coach-office to witness the Lightning's arrival.
Ms they passed, they met the carriage-Jos Sedley's open carriage,
with its magnificent armorial bearings-that splendid conveyance in which
he used to drive about at Cheltenham, majestic and solitary, with his arms
folded, and his hat cocked; or, more happy, with ladies by his side.
Two were in the carriage now: on a little person, with light air,
and dressed in the height of the fashion; the other in a brown silk pressed,
and a straw bonnet with pink ribbons, with a rosy, round, happy face,
that did you good to behold. She checked the carriage as it neared the
three gentlemen, after which exercise of authority she looked rather
nervous, and then began to blush most absurdly.  We have had a de-
rightful drive, George,'' she said, `` and-and we're so glad to come back;
and Joseph, don't let him be late.''
 Don't be leading our husbands into mischief, Mr. Sedley, you wicked,
wicked man you,'' rebecca said, shaking at Jos a pretty little finger
covered with the nearest French kid glove. `No billiards, no smoking.

 My dear Mrs. Crawley-Ah now upon my honour'' was nll Jos
would ejaculate by way of reply; but he managed to fall into u tolerable
attitude, with his head lying on his shoulder, grinning upwards at his
victim, with one hand at his back, which he supported on his cane, and
the other hand (the one with the diamond ring) fumbling in his shirt-frill
and among his under-waisteoats. As the carriage drove off he kissed the
diamond hand to the fair ladies within. He wished all Cheltenham, all
Chowringhee, all Calcutta, could see him in that position, waving his hand
to such a beauty, and in company with such a famous buck as Rawdon
Crawley of the Guards.
Our young bride and bridegroom had chosen Brighton as the place
where they would pass the first few days after their marriage:; and having
engaged apartments at the Ship Inn, enjoyed themselves there in great
comfort and quietude, until Jos presently joined them. Nor was he the
only companion they found there. As they were coming into the Hotel
from a sea-side walk one afternoon, on whom should they light but
Rebecca and her husband. The recognition was immediate. Rebecca
lew into the arms of her dearest friend. Crawley and Osborne shook
hands together cordially enough: and Becky, in the course of a very few
hours, found means to make the latter forget that little unpleasant passage
of words which had happened between them. `` Do you remember the
last time we met at Miss Crawley's, when I was so rude to you, dear
Captain Osborne I thought you seemed careless about dear Amelia.
It was that made me angry: and so pert: and so unkind: and so un-
grateful. Do forgive mel'' Rebecca said, and she held out her hand with
so frank and winning a grace, that Osborne could not but take it. By
humbly and frankly acknowledging yourself to be in the wrong, there is
no knowing, my son, what good you may do. I knew one a gentleman,
and very worthy practitioner in Vanity Fair, who used to do little wrongs
to his neighbours on purpose, and in order to apologise for them in an
open and manly way afterwards-and what ensued My friend Rocky
Doyle was liked everywhere, and deemed to be rather impetuous-but the
honestest fellow. Becky's humility passed for sincerity with George
Osborne.
These two young couples had plenty of tales to relate to each other.
-The marriages of either were discussed; and their prospects in life ca-
passed with the greatest frankness and interest on both sides. George's
marriage was to be made known to his father by his friend Captain
Dobbin; and young Osborne trembled rather for the result of that com-
ammunition. Miss Crawley, on whom all Rawdon's hopes depended,
still held out. Unable to make an entry into her house in Park lAne,
her affectionate nephew and niece had followed her to Brighton, where
they had emissaries continually planted at her door.
I wish you could see some of Rawdon's friends who are always about
our door,'' Rebecca said, laughing. : Did you ever see a run, my dear;
or a bailiff and his man Two of the abominable wretches watched all
last week at the greengrocer's opposite, and we could not get away until
Sunday. If aunt does not relent, what shall we do''
Rawdon, with roars of laughter, related a dozen amusing anecdotes

of his guns, and Rebecca's adroit treatment of them. He vowed with
a great oath, that there was no woman in Europe who could talk a cre-
editor over as she could. Almost immediately after their marriage, her
practice had begun, and her husband found the immense value of such
wife. They had credit in plenty, but they had bills also in abundance,
and laboured under a scarcity of ready money. Did these debt-difficulties
affect Rawdon's good spirits No. everybody in Vanity Fair must
have remarked how well those live who are comfortably and thoroughly in
debt : how they deny themselves nothing; how jolly and easy they are in
their minds. Rawdon and his wife had the very best apartments at the
in at Brighton; the landlord, as he brought in the first dish, bowed before
them as to his greatest customers: and lawton abused the dinners and
wine with an audacity which no grandee in the land could surpass. Long
enstom, a manly appearance, faultless boots and clothes, and a happy
fierceness of manner, will often help a man as much as a great balance at
the banker's.
The two wedding parties met constantly in each other's apartments.
After two or three nights the gentlemen of an evening had a little picquet,
as their wives sate and chatted apart. This pastime, and the arrival of
Jos Sedley, who made his appearance in his grand open carriage, and who
played a few games at billiards with Captain Crawley, replenished DRaw-
don's purse somewhat, and gave him the benefit of that ready money for
which the greatest spirits are sometimes at a stand-still.
So the three gentlemen walked down to see the Lightning conch come
in. Punctual to the minute, the coach crowded inside and out, the guard
blowing his accustomed tune on the horn-the Lightning came tearing
down the street, and pulled up at the coach-office.
:Hello I there's old Dobbin,'' George cried, quite delighted to see
his old friend perched on the roof; and whose promised visit to Brighton
had been delayed until now. : How are you, old felloW Glad you're
come down. Emmy 'll be delighted to see you,'' Osborne said, shaking
his comrade warmly by the hand as soon as his descent from the vehicle
was effected-and then he added, in a lower and agitated voice,  What's
the news. IIave you been in Russell square What does the governor
say Tell me everything.''
Dobbin looked very pale and gray. I've seen your father,'' said he.
`How 's Amelia-Mrs. George? I'll tell you all the news presently: but

We're ordered to Belgium. All the army goes-Guards and all.

goes in command, and we embarked from Chatham next week,''
This news of war could not but come with a shock upon our lovers, and
caused all these gentlemen to look very serious.

to answer, who know, at once, how credulous we are, and how sceptical,

old Some to the alliance: and finally, to communicate it to the latter
in such a way as should least irritate the old gentleman.
Now, before he forced the end of the Osborne house with the news
which it was his duty to tell, Dobbin bethought him that it would be
politic to make friends of the rest of the family, and, if possible, have the
indies on his side. They can't be angry in their hearts, thought he. No
woman ever was really angry at a romantic marriage. A little crying out,
and they must come round to their brother ; when the three of us will lay
siege to old Mr. Osborne. So this Maehiavellian captain of infantry cast
about him for some happy means or strategic by which he could gently
and gradually bring the Miss Osborne to a knowledge of their brother'a
secret.
By a little inquiry regarding his mother's engagements, he was pretty
soon able to find out by whom of her ladyship's friends parties were given
nt that season; where he would be likely to meet Osborne's sisters; and,
though he hund that abhorrence of routs and evening parties, which many
sensible men, alas, entertain, he soon found one where the Miss Stories
were to be present. Making his appearance at the ball, where he danced
a couple of sets with both of them, and was prodigiously polite, he
actually had the courage to ask Miss Osborne for a few minutes' converse-
tion at an early hour the next day, when he had, he said, to -communicate
to her news of the very greatest interest.

day, MAria was not in the drawing-room with her sister, and MIss Wirt
went off for the purpose of fetching the latter, and the Captain and Miss
Osborne were left together. They were both so silent that the tick-tock
of the Sacrifice of lpligenia clock on the mantel-piece became quite rudely
audible.
What a nice party it was last night,'' Miss Osborne at length began,
cncouragingly; ``nl-and how you' re improved in your dancing, Cap-
tain Dobbin. Surely somebody has taught you,'' she added, with amiable
machines.
 You should see me dance a reel with Mrs. Major O'Down of ours;
and a jig-dil you ever see a jig? But I think anybody would dance
with you, Miss Osborne, who dance so well.''
Is the MAjor's lady young and beautiful?' Captain,'' the fair ques-
toner continued. `` Ah, what a terrible thing it must be to be a soldier's
wife. I wonder they have any spirits to dance, and in these dreadful
ties of war too! O Captain Dobbin, I tremble sometimes when I think
of our dearcst George, and the dangers of the noor soldier. Are there
many married officers of the -th, Captain Dobbin ''
``Upon my ord, she's playing her hand rather too openly,'' Miss
WYirt thought; but this observation is merely pareuthetic, and was not
heard through the crevice of the door at which the governess uttered it.

poor as church mice.''
O, how delightful O, ow romantic1'' Miss Osborne tried, as the
Captain said `' old attachment'' and `" poor.'' Her sympathy cnceoursged
him.
The finest young fellow in the regiment,'' he continued.  Not
braver or handsome officer in the army ; and such a charming wife To
you would like her; how you will like her when you know her, Miss
Osborne.'' The young lady thought the actual moment had arrived, and
that Dobbin's nervousness which now came on and was visible in many
twitchings of his face, in his manner of beating the ground with his great
feet, in the rapid bottoming anl unbuttoning of his frock-cont, e.-Miss
Osborne, I ssy, thought that when he had given himself a little air, he
would unosom himself entirely, and prepared eagerly to listen. And the
clock, in the altar on which Iphigenia was situated, beginning, after a pre-
paratory ceonvulsion, to toll twelve, the mere tolling seemed as if it
would last until one-so prolonged was the knell to the anxious spinster,
' But it's not about marriage that I came to speak-that is that mar-
ridge-that is-no, I mean-my dear Miss Osborne, it's about our denr
friend George,'' Dobbin soil.
`About George'' he said in a tone so discomfitel that Maria and
Miss WVirt laughed at the other side of the door, and even that abandoned
wretceh of a Dobbin felt inclined to aile himself; for he was not altogether
unconscious of the state of affairs; George having often battered him grade-
fully and said `Hang it, Will, why don't you take old Poly She'll have
you if you ask her. I 'I1 bet you five to two she will,''
 Yes, about George, then,'' he continued. There has been a differ-
fence between him and Mr, Osborne. And I regard him so much-for you
know we have been like brothers-that I hope and pray the quarrel may
be settled. We must go abroad, Miss Osborne. We may be ordered oli

Don't be agitated, dear Miss Osborne; and those two at least should part

I'm sure all will be well; and denr kholn, who went away from here in
sad sad anger, I know will forgive him. Woman forgives but too readily,

`Such an angel as you I am sure would,'' IF, Dobbin said, with afro-
pious astuteness. `` And no man can pardon himself for giving a woman
pain. What would you feel, if a man were fuaithless to you''
I should perish-I should throw myself out of window-I should
take poison-I should pine and die. I know I should,'' Miss cried, who
has nevertheless gone through one or two affairs of the heart without any
ideas of suicide.
`'`And there are others,'' Dobbin continued, ``as true and as kind-
hearted as yourself. I'm not speaking about the West India heiress,
Miss Osborne, but about a poor girl whom George once loved, and who

was bred from her childhood to think of nobody but him. I've seen her
in her poverty uncomplaining, broken-hearted, without a fault. It is of
Miss Sedley I speak. Dear Miss Osborne, can your generous heart quad-
rel with your brother for being faithful to her Could his own conscience
ever forgive him if he deserted her Be her friend-she always love
you-and-and I am come here charged by George to tell you that he
holds his engagement to her as the most sacred duty he has; and to
entreat to, at least, to be on his side,''
When any strong emotion took possession of Mr. Dobbin, and after the
first word or two of hesitation, he could speak with perfect fluency, and it
was evident that his eloquence on this occasion made some impression
upon the lady whom he addressed.
Well,'' said she, ``this is-most surprising--most painful-most
extraordinary-what will Papa say -that George should fling away such
a superb establishment as was offered to him,-but at any rate he has
found a very brae champion in you, Captain Dobbin. It is of no use,
however,'' she continued, after a pause, `` I feel for poor Miss Sedley, most
certainly-most sincerely you know. We never thought the match a
good one, though we were always very kind to her here-very. But
Papa will never consent, I am sure. And a well brought up young woman
you know,-with a well regulated mind must-George must give her up,
dear Captain Dobbin, level he must.''
`Ought a man to give up the woman he loved, just when misfortune
betel her'' Dobbin said, holding out his hand. Denr Miss Osborne
is this the counsel I hear from you' My der young lady l you must
befriend her. lle can't give her up. He must not give her up. Would
 man, think you, give me up if you were poor ''
This adroit question touched the heart of Miss Jane Osborne not a
little.  `' I don't know whether we poor girls ought to believe what you
men say, Captain,'' she said. `There is that in woman's tenderness
which induces her to believe too easily. I 'm afraid you are cruel cruel
deccivers,''-and Dobbin certainly thought he felt a pressure of the hand
which Miss Osborne had extended to lim.
Ie dropped it in some alarm. `` Deeceiversl'' said he. 'No, dear
Miss Osborne, all men are not; your brother is not; George has loved
Amelia Sedley ever since they were children; no wealth would make him
marry any but her. Ought le to forsake her Would you counsel him
to do so"
What could MIss Jane say to such a question, and with her own peculiar
views She could not answer it, so she parried it by saying, `` Well, if
you are not a receiver, at least you are very rontic;'' and Captain
William let this observation pass without challenge.
At length when, by the help of farther polite speeches, he deemed
that Mise Osborne was sufficiently prepared to receive the whole news, he
poured it into her ear. ` George could not give up Amelia-George was
married to her''-and then he related the circumstances of the marriage
as we know them already, how the poor girl would have died and not her
lover kept his faith : how Old Sedley had refused all consent to the match,
and a licence had been got: and Jos Sedley had come from Cheltenham

to give away the bride: how they had gone to Brighton in Jos's chariot-
and-four to pass the honey-muon: and how George counted on his dear
kind sisters to befriend him with their father, as women-s true and tender
as they were-assuredly would do. And so, asking permission (readily
granted) to see her again, and rightly conjecturing that the news he had
brought would be told in the next five minutes to the other ladies, Captain
Dobbin made his bow and took his leave.
He was scarcely out of the house, when Miss Maria and Miss Wirt
rushed in to Miss Osborne, and the whole wonderful secret was imparted
to them by that lady. To do them justice, neither of the sisters were
very much displeased. There is something about a runaway match with
which few ladies can be seriously angry, and aMelia rather rose in their
estimation, from the spirit which she had displayed in consenting to the
union. As they debated the story, and rattled about it, and wondered
what Papua would do and say, come a loud knock, as of an avenging
thunder-clap, at the door, which made these conspirators start. It must
be Papa, they thought. But it was not he. It was only Mr. Frederick
Bullock, who had come from the city according to appointment, to conduct
the ladies to a flower-show.
This gentleman, as may be imagined, was not kept long in ignorance of
the secret. But his face, when he heard it, showed an amazement which
was very different to that look of sentimental wonder which the county-
dances of the sisters wore. Mr, Bullock was a man of the world, and a
junior partner of a wealthy firm. He knew what money was, and the
value of it: and a delightful throb of expectation lighten up his little eyes,
and caused him to smile on his Maria, as he thought that by this piece of
folly of Mr. George's she might be worth thirty thousand pounds more
than he had ever hoped to get with her.
Gad . Jane,'' said he, surveying even the elder sister with some interest,
fEels will be sorry he cried off. You may be a fifa thousand pounder yet.''
The sisters had never thought of the money question up to that
moment, but Fred Bullock battered them with graceful gaiety about it
during their forenoon's excursion; and they had risen not a little in their
own esteem by the time when, the morning amusement over, they drove
back to dinner. And do not let my respected reader exclaim against this
selfishness as unnatural. It was but this present morning, as he rode on
the omnibus from Richmond; while it changed horses, this present
chronicler, being on the roof, marked three little children playing in a
puddle below, very dirty and friendly and happy. To these three prc-
gently came another little oe. Polly,'' says she, ``your sister's got a
penny.'' At which the children got up from the puddle instantly, and
ran of to pay their court to Peggy. And as the omnibus drove of I
saw Peggy with the infantile procession at her tail, marching with great

O having prepared the sisters, Dobbin hast-
ened away to the City to perform the rest
and more difficult part of the task which
he had undertaken. The idea of facing old
Osborne rendered him not a little nervous,
and more than once he thought of leaving the
young ladies to communicate the secret,
which, as he was aware, they could not long
retain. BUt he had promised to report to
George upon the manner in which the elder
Osborne bore the intelligence; so going into
 the City to the paternal counting-house in
i .aG
L  to Mr. Osborne begging for a half-hour's
conversation relative to the affairs of his son
George. Dobbin's messenger returned from Mr. Osborne's house of
business, with the compliments of the latter, who would be very happy
to see the Captain immediately, and away accordingly Dobbin went to
confront him.
The Captain, with a half-guilty secret to confess, and with the purpose
of a painful and stormy interview before him, entered Mr. Osborne's offices
with a most dismal countenancee aud abashed gait, and, passing through
the outer room where Mr. Chopper presided, was greeted by that fmc-
binary from his desk with a haggis air which farther discomfited him.
Mr, Chopper winked and nodded and pointed his pen towards his patron's
door, and said,  You'll find the governor all right,'' with the most pro-
voting good humour.
Osborne rose too, and shook him henrtily by the hand, and said,  How
do, my dear boy ?'' with a cordiality that made poor George's ambassador
feel doubly guilty. His hand lay as if dead in the old gentleman's grasp.
IIe felt that he, Dobbin, was more or less the cause of all that had
happened. It was he had brought back George to Amelia; it was he had
applauded, encouraged, transacted almost the marriage which he was
come to reveal to George's father : and the latter was receiving him with
smiles of welcome; patting him on the shoulder, and calling lim
`Dobbin, my der boy.'' The envoy had indeed good reason to hang
his head.
Osborne fully believed that Dobbin had come to announce his son's
surrender. Mr. Chopper and his principal were talking over the matter
between George and his father, at the very moment when Dobbin's

messenger arrived. Both agreed that George was sending in his submit-
sion. Both had been expecting it for some days-and `` Lord1 Chopper,
whnt a marriage we'll have,'' Mr. Osborne said to his clerk, snapping his
big fingers, and jingling all the guineas and shillings in his great pockets
as he eyed his subordinate with a look of triumph.
With similar operations conducted in both pockets, and a knowing jolly
air, Osborne from his chair regarded Dobbin seated blank and silent
opposite to him.  WHat a bumpkin he is for a Captain in the army,'' old
Osborne thought. I wonder George hasn't taught him better manners.''
At Iast Dobbin summoned courage to begin. : Sir,'' said so, ``I've
brought you some very grave news. I have been at the COurse Guards
this morning, and there 's no doubt that our regiment will be ordered
abroad, and on its way to Belgium before the week is over. And you
know, Sir, that we sh'nt be he again before a tussle which may be fatal
to many of us.''
Osborne looked gone. ``My s--, the regiment will to its duty, Sir,
I daresay,'' he soil.
The French are very strong, Sir,'' Dobbsin went on.  The Russians
and Austrians will be a long time before they can bring their troops down.
We shall have the first of the fight, in; and depend on it Boney will
take care that it shall be a hard one.''
 Who are you driving at, Dobbin,'' his interlocutor said, nensy
and with a scowl. 'I suppose no Briton's afraid of any d- French-
man, hay ''
I only mean, that before we go, and considering the great and certain
risk that hangs over every one of us-if there are any differences between
you and George-it would be as well, Sir, that-that you should shake
hands: wouldn't it Should anything happen to him, I think you would
never forgive yourself if you hadn't parted in charity.''
As he said this, poor William Dobbin brushed crimson, and felt and
owned that he himself was a traitor. But for him, perhaps, this severance
neel never have taken place. Why and not George's marriage been
delayed  What call was there to press it on so eagerly? He felt that
George would have parted from Amelia at any rate without n mortal pang.
amelia, too, might have recovered the shock of losing him. It was his
counsel has brought about this marriage, and all that was to cnsue from
it. And why was it Because he loved her so much that he would not
bear to see her unhappy: or because his own sufferings of suspense were
so unendurable that he was glad to crush them at once-as we hasten a
funeral after n death, or, when a separation from those we love is immi-
next, cannot rest until the parting be over.
ou arc a good fellow, William,'' soil MIr. Osborne in a softened voice;
`and me and George shouldn't part in anger, that is true. Look here.
I 've done for him as much as any father ever did. 1e's had three times
as tech one from me, as 1 warrant your father ever gave you. But lI
lon't brag about that. How I've toilet for him, and worked and employed
y talents and energy, I won't say. Ask Chopper. Ask himself. Ask the
City of London. Well, I propose to him such a marriage as any nobleman
in the land might be proud of-the only thing in lite 1 ever asked him-

and he refuses me. Am I wrong Is the quarrel of y making What
do I seek but his good, for which I've been toiling like a convict ever since
he was born? Nobody can say there 's anything selfish in me. Let him
come back. I say, here's my hand. I sy, forget and forgive. As for
marrying now, it 's out of the question. Let him and Miss S. make it up,
and make out the marriage afterwards, when he comes back a Colonel; for
he shall be a Colonel, by G- he shall, if only can do it. I'm glad
you've brought him round. I know it's you Dobbiu. You 've took him
out of many a scrape before. Let him come. lI shan't be harl. Coe
along, and dine in russell Square to-day: both of you. The old shop,
the old hour. you 'll find a neck of venison, and no questions asked.''
This praise and confidence smote Dobbin's heart very keenly. Every
moment the colloquy continued in this tone, he felt more and more guilty.
Sir,'' sailhe, ' I fear you deceive yourself. I am sure you do. George
is much too high-minded a man over to marry for money. A threat on
your part that you would disinherit him in case of disobedience would
only be followed by resistance on his.''
WHy, hang it, man, you don't call offering him eight or ten thousand
 year, threatening lim :'' Mr. Osborne said, with still provoking good
hour. 'Gad, if Miss S. will have me, I'm hcr man. I paint pnr-
titular about a shade or so of tawny.'' Ad the old gentleman gave his
knowing grin, and coarse laugh.
 You forget, Sir, previous engagements into which Captain Osborne
ad entered,'' the ambassador said, gravely.
What engagements Whnt the devil do you mean? You don't
mean,'' Mr. Osborne continued, gathering wrath and astonishment as the
thought now first camc upon him-you don't mean that he's such a
d- fool is to be still hankeringg after that swindling oll bankrupt's
daughter? You 've not come here for to make me suppose that he wants
to marry ler  Marry her, that is a good one. My son and heir marry
a beggar's girl out of a gutter. D- him, if he does, lct lim buy a
broom and sweep a crossing. She was always dangling and ogling after
him, I recollcct now; and I've no doubt she was put on by her old
sharer of a father.''
Mr. Sedley was your cry good friend, Sir,'' Dobbin interposed, almost
pleased at finding himself growing angry.  Time was you called him
better names than rogue and swindlers. The match was of your making
George had not right to play fast and loose-.''
 Fast and loose'' howled out old Osborne. Fast and loose. WHy,
hang me, those are the very words my gentleman set himself when he
gave himself airs, Iast Theory was a fortnight, and talked about the
British army to his father who made him, What, it's you who have
been a setting of him up-is it' and my service to you, Captain. It's
you who want to introduce beggars into my family. Thank you for
nothing, Captain. Marry Her indeed-he, hel why should he? Warrant
you she'd go to him fast enough without.''
Sir,'' said Dobbin, starting up in undisguised anger; ``no an small
abuse that lady in my hearing, and you least of all.''
'O, you're a going to call me out, are you? Stop, let me ring t.e

ell for pistols for two. Mr. George sent you here to insult his father,
did he2'' Osborne said, pulling at the bell-orl.
Mr. Osborne,'' said Dobbin, with a faltering voice, `` it's you who are
insulting the best creature in the world. ou had best spare her, Sir, for
he's your son's wife.''
And with this, feeling that he could say no more, Dobbin went asay,
Osborne sinking back in his chair, and looking wildly after him. A clerk
came in, obedient to the ball; and the Captain was scarcely out of the
court where Mr. Osborne's offices were, when Mr. Chopper the chief clerk
came rushing hapless after him.
 or God's sake, what is it P'' MIr., Chopper said, catching the Captain
by the skirt. ``1he governor's in a fit. What has Mr. george been
ding?''
He married Miss Sedley five days ago,'' Dobbin replied. `I was his
groomsman, MIr. Chopper, and you must stand his friend.''
The old clerk shook his head.  If that's your news, Captain, it 's Mal.
The governor will never forgive lim.''
Dobbin begged Chopper to report progress to him at the hotel where
he was stopping, and walked of moody westwards, greatly perturbed is
to the past and the future.
WHen the Russell Square family came to dinner that evening, they found
the father of the house seated in his usual place, but with that nir of gloom
on his face, which, whenever it appeared there, kept the whole circle silent.
The allies and Mr. Bullock who dine with them, felt that the news had
been communicated to Mr. Osborne. His dark looks afleetel MIr. Bullock
so far as to render him still and quiet: but he was unusually bland and
attentive to Miss Marias, by whom ho out, and to her sister presiding at the
end of the table.
Miss Wirt, by consequence, was alone on her side of the board, a g
being left between her and Miss Jane Osborne. Now this was George's
place when he died at home ; and his cover, as we said, was laid for him
in expectation of the truant's return. Nothing occurred during dinner-
time except smiling Mr. Frederic's flagging confidential whispers, and the
clicking of plate and china, to interrupt the silence of the repust. The
servants went about stealthily doing their duty. Mutes at funerals could
not look moro glum than the domestic of Mr. Osborne. ho neck of
venison of which he had invited Dohbin to partake, was carved by him in
perfect silence ; but his own share went away almost untested, though he
drank much, and the butler nssiduously filled lis glass.
At last, just at the end of the dinner, his eyes, which has been staring
at everyone in turn, fixed themselves for a while upon the plate laid for
George. He pointed to it presently with his left hand. Isis daughter
looked at him and did not comprehend, or choose to comprehend, the
signal; nor did the servants at first understand it.
 The that plate away,'' at last he said, getting up with an oath-and
with this pushing lis chair back, he walked into his own room.
Behind Mr, Osborne's dining-room was the usual apartment which went
in his house by the name of the study; and was sacred to the master of
the house. Hither Mr. Osborne would retire of a Sunday forenoon when

not minded to go to church; and here pass the morning in his crimson
leather chair, reading the paper. A couple of glazed book-cases were here,
containing standard works in stout gilt bindings. The '`Annul register,''
the `` Gentleman's Magazine,''  Blair's Sermons,'' and '` Hume anl Smol-
let.'' From year's end to year's end he never took one of these volumes
from the shelf; but there was no member of the family that would dare
for his life to touch one of the books, except upon those rare Sunday
evenings when there was no dinner party, and when the great scarlet bIble
and Prayer-book were taken out from the corner where they stood beside
his copy of the league, and the servants being run up to the dining par-
four, Osborne read the evening service to his family in a loud grating
pompous voice. No member of the household, child or domestic, ever
entered that room without a certain terror. PIece e checked the louse-
keeper's accounts, and overhauled the butler's cellar-book. SInce he could
command, across the clean gravel court-yard, the back entrance of the
stables with which one of his bells communicated, and into this yard the
columbian issued from his premises as into a dock, and Osborne swore t
him from the study willow. Four times a year Miss Wirt entered this
apartment to get her salary; and his daughters to receive their quarterly
allowance. George as a boy had been horsewhipped in this room many
times; his rother sitting sick on the stair listening to the cuts of the
whip. The boy was scarcely ever known to cry under the punishment;
the poor woman used to fondle and kiss lim secretly, and give him money
to soothe him when he came out.
There was a picture of the family over the mantel-piece, remodel thither
from the front room after Mr. Osborne's death-george was on a money,
the older sister holding him up a bunch of flowers; the younger led by
her mother's hand,; all with red clerks and large red mouths, simmering
on each other in the approved family-portrait manner. The mother lay
under ground no, long since forgotten-the sisters and brother had a
hundred different interests of their own, and, familiar still, were utterly
estranged from each other. Some few score of years afterwards, when all the
parties represented are grow old, whnt bitter entire there is in thoseflaunt-
ing childish film-portraits, with their farce of sentiment and smiling lies,
and innocence so self-conscious and self-satisfied. Osborne's own state
portrait, with that of his great silver inkstnnd and arm-chair, had taken the
place of honour in the dining-room, vacated by the family-piece.
To this study old Osborne retired then, greatly to the relief of the small
party whom he left. When the servants and withdrawn, they began to
talk for a while volubly but very low; then they went up stairs quietly,
Mr. Block accompanying them stealthily of his creaking shoes. He
had no lent to sit alone drinking wine, and so close to the terrible old
gentleman in the study hard at hand.
n hour at least after dark, the butler, not having received any sum-
mons, ventured to tap at his door and take him in wax candles and tea.
The master of the house state in his chair, pretending to real the paper,
and when the servant, placing the lights and refreshment on the table by
him, retired, Mr. Osborne got up and locked the door after him. This
time there was no mistaking the matter; all the household knew that one

great catastrophe was going to happen which was likely direly to
affect Master George.
In the large shining mahogany escrutoire Mr. Osborne had a drawer
especially devoted to his son's affairs and papers. lItre he kept all the
documents relating to him ever siuee he had been a boy: here were his
prize copy-books and drawing-books, all bearing George's hand, and that
of the master : here were his first letters in large round hand selling his
love to papa and mum, and conveying his petitions for a cuba. IIis dear
godpapa Sedley was more than once mentioned in them. Curses quivered
on old Osborne's livid lips, und horrid hatred and disappointment writhed
in his heart, is looking through some of these papers he came on the name.
They were all marked and pocketed, and tied with red tape. It was-

or `Georgy about n money, October 13,''-and so forth. In another
packet were  IDr. S.'s accounts''-- G.'s tailor's bills and outfit, drafts

agent's letters, and the newspapers containing his commissions: here was
a whip he had when a boy, and in a paper a locket containing his hair,
which his mother used to wear.
Turning one over after another, and musing over these memorials, the
unhappy man passed many hours. His densest vanities, ambitions, hopes,
had all been here. What pre he had in his boy hE was the hand-
somest child oever seen. Everybody said he was like a nobleman's son.
A royal princess had remarked hir, and kissel him, and asked his name
in New Gardens. What city-man could show such another? Could n
prince have been better cared for Anything that money could by had
been his son's. He used to go down on speech-days with four horses
and new liveries, and scatter new shillings among the boys at the school
where George was: when he went with George to the lep6t of his regis-
ment, before the boy embarked for Canada, he gave the officers such a
dinner as the Duke of York might have sat down to. IPad he ever

huntsman-on the day when he was presented to the Prince Regent at
the levee, when nll Saint James's couldn't produce n finer young fellow.

of sickening rage, balked ambition and love ; what wounds of outraged
vanity, tenderness even, and this old wording now to suffer under
Having examined these papers, and pondered over this one and the
other, in that bitterest of all helpless woe, with which miserable men think
of happy past times-George's father took the whole of the documents out

writing-box, which he tied and sealed with his seal. Then he opened the

pompous book, seldom looked at, and shining all over with gold. There
was a frontispiece to the volume, representing Abraham sacrificing Isaac.
Here, according to custom, Osborne had recorded on the fly-leaf, and
in his large clerk-like and, the dates of his marriage and his wife's
death, and the births and Christian names of his children. Jane came
first, the George edley Osborne, then Maria Frances, and the days of
the christening of each. Taking a pen, he carefully obliterated George's
names from the page; and when the leaf was quite dry, restored the
volume to the place from which he had moved it. hen he took a
document out of another drawer, were his own private papers were kept;
and having real it, crumpled it up and lighted it but one of the candles,
and saw it burn entirely away in the rate. It was his will; which
being burned, he sat down and wrote off a letter, and ran for his ser-
want, whom he charged to deliver it in the morning. It was morning
already: as he went up to be, the whole house was alight with the
sunshine: and the birds were singing among the fresh green leaves in
Russell Square.
Anxious to keep all Mr. Osborne's family and dependants in good humour,
and to make as many friends as possible for George in his hour of adversity,
WIlliam Dobbin, who knew the effect which good dinners and good wines
have upon the soul of man, wrote off immediately on his return to his in,
the most hospitable of invitations to Thomas Chopper, Esquire, begging
that gentleman to dine with him at the Slaughter's next day. The note
reached Mr. Chopper before he left the City, and the instant reply is,
that ` Mr. Chopper presents his respectful compliments, and will have the
honour and pleasure of writing on Captain D.'' he invitation and the
rough draft of the answer were shown to Mrs. Chopper and her daughters
on his return to Somers' Town that evening, and they talked about mile-
tary gents and West End men with great exaltation as the family sate
and puartook of tea. WHen tlc girls had gone to rest, Mr. and Mrs. C.
discourse upon the strange events which were occurring in the governor's
family. Never had the clerk seen bis principal so moved. When he
went in to Mr. Osborne, after Captain Dobbin's departure, Mr. Chopper
found his chief black in the face, and all but in a fit: some dreadful quad-
rel, he was certain, had occurred between Mr. O. and the young Captain.
Chopper had been instructed to make out on account of all sums paid
to Captain Osborne within the last three years. ``And a precious lot of
money he has nhl too,'' the chief clerk said, and respected his old and
yoiig master the more, for the liberal way in which the guiness had
been flung about. The dispute was something about Miss Sedley. Mre.
Chopper vowed and declared, she pitch that poor young lady to lose such
n handsome young flow as the Casting. As the daughter of an unlucky
speculator, who had paid a very shabby dividend, Mr. Chopper had no
great regard for Miss Seley. He respected the house of Osborne before
all outliers in the city of London: and his hope and wish was, that Captain
George should marry a nobleman's daughter. The clerk slept a great
deal sounder than his principal that night ; and, cuddling his children
after breakfast, of which he partook with a very hearty appetite (though
his modest cup of life was only sweetened with brown sugar), he set off in

Mr, Osborne's conntenance, when he arrived in the City at his usual
time, struck those dependants who were accustomed, for good reasons, to
watch its expression, as peculiarly ghastly and wo. At twelve o'clock
Mr. Higgs (of the form of Higgs & Blatherwick, solicitors, Bedford Row,)
called by appointment, and was ushered into the governor's private room,
and closeted there for more than an hour. At about one Mr. Chopper
received a note brought by Captain Dobbin's man, and containing an
enclosure for Mr. Osborne, which the clerk went in and delivered. A
short time afterwards MIr. Chopper and Mr. Birch, the next clerk, were
summoned, and requested to witness a paper.  I've been making a new
till,'' Mr. Osborne said, to which these gentlemen appended their names
accordingly. No conversation passed. Mr. Higgs looked exceedingly
grave as he came into the outer rooms, and very hard in Mr. Chopper's
face; but there were not any explanations. It was remarked that Mr.
Osborne was particularly quiet nd gentle all day, to the surprise of
those who had augured ill from his darling demeanour. Ile called no
man names that day, and was not heard to swear once. He left business
early ; and before going away, summoned his chief clerk once more, and
having given him general instructions, asked him, after some seeming
hesitation and reluctance to speak, if he knew whether Captain Dobbin
was in town f
Chopper said he believed he was. Indeed both of them knew the fact
perfectly.

UNIFY FAIR.
Osborne took a letter directed to that officer, and, giving it to the clerk,
requested the latter to deliver it into Dobbin's own hands immediately.
`And now Chopper,'' says he, taking his hat, and with a strange look,
`my mind will be easy.'' Exactly as the clock struck two, (there was no
doubt an appointment between the pair,) Mr. Frederick Bullock called,
and he and Mr. Osborne walked away together,
The Colonel of the -th regiment, in which Messieurs Dobbin and Os-
borne had companies, was an old general who had made his first campaign
under Wolf at Quebec, and was long since quite too old and feeble for
command; but he took some interest in the regiment of which he was the
nominal head, and made certain of his young officers welcome at his table,
a kind of hospitality which I believe is not altogether common amongst
his brethren of the present day. Captain Dobbin was an especial favourite
of this old General. Dobbin was versed in the literature of his profession,
and could talk flout the great Frederic and the Empress Queen and their
works host as well as the General himself, who was indifferent to the
triumphs of the present day, and whose heart was with the tacticians of fifty
years back. This officer sent a summons to Dobbin to come and breakfast
with him, on the morning when Mr. Osborne altered his will and MIr.
Chopper put on his best shirt frill, and then informed his young favourite, a
couple of days in advance, of that which they were all expecting-a march-
in order to go to Belgium. The order for the regiment to hold itself in
readiness would leave the 1Horse Guards in a day or two; and as trans-
ports were in plenty, they would get their route before the week was over.
recruits has come in during the stay of the regiment at Chatham; and the
old General hoped that the regiment which had helped to beat Montcalm
in Canada, and to rout Mr. WAshington on Long Island, would prove
itself worthy of its historical reputation on the oft-trolden battle-grounds
of the lOw Countries. ``And so my good friend, if you have any afire
I,'' said the old General, taking a pinch of snuff with his trembling white
old hand, and then pointing to the spot of his robe de came under
which his heart was still feebly beating, ``if you have any Phillis to con-
sole, or to bid farewell to papa and mama, or any will to nke, I recom-
mend you to set about your business without delay.'' With which the
General gave his young friend s finger to shake, and a good-natured nod
of his powdered and pig-tailed head; and the door being closed upon Dob-
bin, asate don to be e e e was exceedingly in of his French) ta
Malemoiselle Amended of His MAjesty's Theatre.
This news made Dobbin grave, and he thought of our friends at Brighton,
and then he was ashamed of himself that Amelia was always the first thing.
in his thoughts, (always before anybody-before father and mother, sisters
and duty-always at waking nd sleeping indeed, and all day long); and
returning to his hotel, he sent off a brief note to Mr, Osborne acquainting
him with the information which he had received, and which might tend
farther, he hoped, to bring about a reconciliation with George.
This note, dispatched by the same messenger who sd carried the in-
citation to Chopper on the previous day, alarmed the worthy clerk not a
little. It was invested to him, and as he opened the letter he trembled
lest tie dinner should be put off on which he was calculating. ellis mind

was inexpressily relieved when he found that the envelope was only a
reminder for himself. (I shall expect you at half-past five,'' Captain Dob-
bin wrote). He was very much interested about his employer's family;
but, he coulec out ' a grand dinner was of more concern to him than
the affairs of any other mortal.
Dobbin ws quite justified in repeating the General's information to any
officers of the regiment whom he should see in the course of his peregrina-
nations; accordingly he imparted it to Ensign Stumble, whom he met at
the agent's, and who, such was his military honour, went off instantly to
purchase a new sword at the nccoutrement-maker's. More this young
fellow, who though only seventeen years of age, and about sixty-five inches
high, with a constitution naturally rickety nd much impaired by prcna-
ture brandy and water, had an undoubted courage and a lion's heart, poised,
tried, bent, and balanced a weapon such as he thought would do execu-
tion amongst Frenchmen. Shouting `` IIa, ha,'' and stamping lis little feet
with tremendous energy, he delivered the point time or thrice nt Captain
Dobbsin, who carried the thrust laughingly with his bamboo walking-stick.
Mr, Stubble, as may be supposed from his size and tenderness, was of
the Light Bobs. ENsign rooney, on the contrary, was a tall youth, and
belonged to (Captain Dobbin's) the Grenadier Company, and he tried on
a new bent-skin cap, under which he looked stage beyond his ycnrs.
Then these two lads went off to the Slaughter's, and having ordered a
furious dinner, sate down and wrote off letters to the kind anxious parents
at home-letters full of love and otherness, and pluck anl bad spelling.
Ahl there were many anxious hearts beating through England at that
time; and mothers' prayers and tears flowing in many homesteads.

tables at the Slaughter's, and the tears trickling down his nose on to the
paper, (for the youngster was thinking of his mama, and that he might
never see her again,) Dobbin, who was going to write off a letter to
George Osborne, relented, and locked up his desk.  Why should I?2'
said he. `'Lct her have this night, happy. Ill go and see my parents
early in the morning, and go down to Brighton myself to-morrow.''
So he went up and said his big hand on young Stubble's shoulder, and
backed up that young champion, and told him if he would leave off brandy
nd water he would be a good soldier, as he always as a gentlemanly
good-hearted fellow. Young Stubble's eyes brightened up at this, for
Dobbin was greatly respected in the regiment, as the best officer and the
cleverest man in it.
 Thank you, Dobbin,'' he said, rubbing his eyes with his knuckles, I
was just-just telling her I would. And, O Sir, she's so dam kind to
me.'' The water pumps were at work again, and I am not sure that the
soft-hearted Captain's eyes did not also twinkle.
The two ensigns, the captain and Mr. Chopper, dined together in the
same box. Chopper brought the letter from Mr. Osborne in which the
latter briefly presented lis compliments to Captain Dobbin, and requested
him to forward the enclosed to Captain George Osborne. Chopper knew
nothing further ; he described Mr. Osborne's appearance, it is true, and his
interview with his lawyer, wondered how the governor and sworn at
nobody, and, especially as the wine circled round, abounded in speculations
and conjectures. But these grew more vague with every glass, and at length
became perfectly unintelligible. At a late hour Captain Dobbin put his
guest into u hackney coach, in a hiccupping state, nd swearing that he
would be the kick--the kick-captain's friend for ever and ever.
WHen Captain Dobbin took leave of Miss Osborne we have said tent he
asked leave to come and pay her another visit, and the spinster expected
him for some hours the next day, when, perhaps, had he come, and had he
asked her that question which she was prepared to answer, she would have
declared herself as her brother's friend, and a reconciliation might have
been effected between George and his angry father. But though she
waited at home the captain neer come. lle had his own affairs to pur-
sue; his own parents to visit and console; and at an early hour of the day
to take his place on the Lightning coach, and go down to his friends at
Brighton. In the course of the day Miss Osborne heard her father give
orders that that meddling scoundrel, Captain bDobbin, should never be
admitted within his doors again, and any hopes in which she may have
indulged privately, were thus abruptly brought to an end. Mr. Frederic
Bullock came, and was particularly affectionate to MAria, and attentive to
the broken-spirited old gentleman. For though he said his mind would
be easy, the means which he had taken to secure quiet did not seem to
have succeeded as yet, and the events of the past two days had visibly
shattered him.

cONDUCTED to the ladies, at the
Ship Inn, Dobbin assumed a jovial
and rattling manner, which proved
that this young officer was be-
coming a more consummate typo-
write every day of his life. IIe
was trying to hide his own private
feelings, first upon seeing Mrs.
George Osborne in her new con-
dition, and secondly to mask the
apprehensions he entertained as to
the effect which the dismal news
brought down by him would cer-
mainly have upon her.
 It is my opinion, George,''
he sid, that the French Em-
perot will be upon us, horse and foot, before three weeks are over, and
will give the Duke such a dance as shall make the Peninsula appear mere
child's play. But you need not say that to Mrs. Osborne, you know.
There may't be any fighting on our side after all, and our business in
Belgium may turn out to be a mere military occupation. Many persons
think so; and Brussels is full of fine people and ladies of fashion.'' So
it was agreed to represent the duty of the British army in Belgium in this
harmless light to Amelia.
This plot being arranged, the hypocritical Dobbin saluted Mrs. George
Osborne quite gaily, tried to pay her one or two compliments relative to
her new position as a bride (which compliments, it must be confessed,
were exceedingly clumsy and hung fire woefully), and then fell to talking
about Brighton, and the sea-air, and the gieties of the place, and the
beauties of the road and the merits of the `' Lightning'' coach and horses,
--all in a manner quite incomprehensible to Amelia, and very amusing ta

always spoke most highly of his friend's good qualities. In her little any
of triumph, and not knowing him intimately as yet, she made light of
honest William-and he knew her opinions of him quite well, and
acquiesced in the very humbly. A time came when she knew him
better, and changed her motions regarding him: but that was distant
as yet.
As for Rebecca, Captain Dobbin had not been two hours in the ladies'
company, before she understood his secret perfectly. She did not like
him, and feared him privately; nor was he very much prcpossessed in her
favour. He was so honest, that her arts and clerics is not affect him,
and he shrank from her with instinctive repulsion. And, as she was by no
means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy, she disliked him
the more for his adoration of Amelia. Nevertheless, she was very
respectful and cordial in her manner towards him. A friend to the
Osborne a friend to ler dearest benefactors Sh vowed she should
always love him sincerely : she remembered him quite well on the Vaux-
hall night, as she told Amelia archly, and she made a little fun of him
when the two ladies went to dress for diner. Rawdon Crawley paid
scarcely any attention to Dobbin, looking upon him as a good-natured
nincompoop, aud under-bred city man. Jos patronised him with much
dignity.
When George and Robin were alone in the latter's room, to which
George had followed him, Dobbin took from his less the letter which
he had been charge by Mr. Osborne to deliver to his son.  It 's not in
my father's hand-writing,'' said George, looking rather alarmed; nor
was it: the letter was from Mr. Osborne's lawyer, and to the following
elect :-
 BrOwn Row, Fay 7, 1815.
So,
 I am commissioned by Mr. Osborne to inform you, that he abides by
the determination which e before expressed to you, and that in cone-
quience of the marriage which you have been pleased to contract, he
ceases to consider you henceforth as a member of his family. This deter-
mination is final and irrevocable.
`although the monies expended upon you in your minority, and the
bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years, far
exceed in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right,
(being the third part of the fortune of your mother, the late Mrs. Osborne,
and which reverted to you at her deceased, and to Miss Jane Osborne and
Miss Maria Frances Osborne;) yet I am instructed by Mr. Osborne to
say, that he waives all claim upon your estate, and that the sum of 2000,
4 per cent. annuities, at the value of the day (being your one-third share
of the sum of E6000,) shall be paid over to yourself or your agents upon
your receipt for the same, y
 Your obedient Serve.,
S. Ions.''
P.9S.-Mr. Osborne desires me to say, once for all, that he declines to
receive any messages, letters, or communications from you on this or any
other subject.''

'A pretty as you have managed the affair,'' said George, looking
savagely at William Dobbin. ``Look there, Dobbin,'' and he flung over
to the latter is parent's letter. ``A beggar, y Jove, and all in cone-
quenee of my d-d sentimentality. Why wouldn't we have waited? A
ball might have done for me in the course of the war, and may still, and
how will Emmy be bettercd by being left n beggar's widow It was all
your doing. Iou were never easy until you had got me married and
ruined. What the deuce am I to do with two thousand points Such
n sum won't last two years. I 've lost a hundred nnl forty to Crawley at
cards and billiards since I've been down here. A pretty manager of a
man's matters you are, forsyth.''
There's no denying that the position is a hard one,'' Dobbin replied,
after reading over the letter with a blank countenance; `` and, as you say,
it is partly of my making. There are some men that wouldn't mind changing
with you,'' he added, with a bitter smile.  How many Captains in the
regiment have two thousand pounds to the fore, think you? You must
live on your pay till your father relents, and if you die, you leave your
wife a hundred a year.''
Do you suppose a man of my habits can live on his pay and a hun-
dred a year'' George cries out in great anger.  You must be a fool to
talk so, Dobbin. How the deuce am l to keep up my position in the
world upon such a pitiful pittancef I can't change my habits. I must
lae my comforts. I wasn't brought up on porridge like MacWhirler, or
on potatoes, like old O'Down. Do you expect my wife to take in soldiers'
washing, or ride after the regiment in a baggage wagon''
Well, we,'' said Dobbin, still good-naturedly, ' we 'll get her a better
conveyance. But try and remember that you are only a dethroned prince
now, George, my boy; and be quiet whilst the tempest lasts. It won't be
for long. Let your name be mentioned in the Gazette, and I'll engage
the old father relents towards you.''
Mentioned in the Gazette.'' George answered. ' And in what part
of it Among the killed and wounded returns, and at the top of the list,
very likely.''
Sha It will be time enough to cry out when we are hurt,'' Dabbun
said. `' And if anything happens, you know, George, I have got a little,
and I am not a marrying man, and I shall not forget my godson in my
ill,'' he added, with a smile. Whereupon the dispute ended,-as many
scores of such conversations between Osborne and his friend had concluded
previously-by the former declaring there was no possibility of being angry
with Dobbin long, and forgiving him very generously after abusing hi
without cause,
`I sy, Becky,'' erie Rawdon Crawley out of his dressing-room, to
his lady, who was battling herself for dinner in her own chamber.
WIt '' said Becky's shrill voice. She was looking over her shoulder
in the glass. She had put on the nearest and freshest white frock imagin-
able, and with bare shoulders and a little necklace, and a light blue sash,
she looked the image of youthful innocence and girlish happiness.

tion on his pretty little wife.
`I suppose she 'll try her eyes out,'' Becky answered. ` She has been
whimpering half-a-dozen of times at the very notion of it, already to me.''

want of feeling.

replied. :Besides, you 're different. You go as General Tufto's aide-
de-camp. e don't belong to the line,'' Mrs. Crawley said, throw-
in up her head with an air that so enchanted her husband that he stooped
down and kissed it.

called George Oborne, Cupid. Sle had flattered him about his good
looks a score of times already. She watched over him kindly ut crate of
 night when he would drop in to RAwdon's quarters for a half-hour
before bed-time.

having presented it in former days upon Rawdon Crawley. He thought
her gay, brisk, arch, distinguee, delightful. In their little drives and
dinners Becky, of course, quite outshone poor Emmy, who remained
very mute and timid while Mrs. Crowley and her husband rattled away
together, and Captain Crawley (and Jos after he joined the young married
people) gobbled in silence.
Emmy's mind somehow misgave her about her friend. Reuben's wit,
spirits, and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet. They
were only a week married, and here was George already suffering ennis
and eager for others' society She trembled for the future. How shall
I be a companion for him, she thought,-so clever and so brilliant, and 1
such a humble foolish creature How noble it was of him to marry me-
to give up everything and stoop down to me. I ought to have refused
him, only I had not the heart. I ought to have stopped at home and
taken care of poor pope. And hcr neglect of her parents (and indeed
there was some foundation for this charge which the poor child's uneasy
conscience brought against her) was now remembered for the first time,
and caused her to blush with humiliation. Ohl thought the, I have been
very wicked and selfish-selfish in forgetting them in their sorrows-
selfish in forcing George to marry me. I know I 'm not worthy of him-
I know he would have been happy without me-and yet-I tried, I tried
to give him up.
It is hard when, before sewvrlays of marriage are over, such thoughts
and confessions as these force shelves on a little bride's mind. But so
it was, and the night before Robin came to join these young people-on
a fine brilliant moonlight night of May-so warm and balmy that the
windows weren open t t battle, from which George aril Mrs.
Crawley wefgazing upon the calm ocean spread shining before them,

had she regarded it, offered a dismal prospect; but Lemmy was too sly, so

n stratagemP''
George burst out laughing at the idea of this aquatic meeting. : What's
the row there, you two'' Rawdon shouted out, rattling the box.
Amelia was making a fool of herself in an absurd hysterical manner, and
retired to her own room to whimper in private.
Our history is destined in this Chapter to go backwards and forwards in
a very irresolute manner seemingly, and having conducted our story to
to-morrow presently, we shall immediately again have occasion to step back
to yesterday, so that the whole of the tale may get a hearing. As you be-
old at her Majesty's drawing-room, the ambassadors' and high dignitaries'
carriages whisk off from a private door, while Captain Jones's ladies are
waiting for their fly: as you see in the Secretary of the Treasury's ante-
chamber, a half-dozen of petitioners waiting patiently for their audience, and
called out one by one, when suddenly an Irish member or some eminent per-
sonage enters the apartment, and instantly walks into Mr. Under-Secretary
over the heads of all the people present: so in the conduct of a tale, the
romance is obliged to exercise this most partial sort of justice. Although
all the little incidents must be heard, yet they must be put off when the
great events make their appearance; and surely such a circumstance as
that which brought Dobbin to Brighton, viz. the ordering out of the
Guards and the line to belgium, and the mustering of the allied armies in
that country under the command of his Grace the Duke of Wellington-
such a dignified circumstance as that I say-was entitled to the was over nll
minor occurrences whereof this history is composed mainly, and hence a
little trifling disarrangement and disorder was excusable and becoming.
We have only now advanced in time so far beyond Chapter XXII. as to
have got our various characters up into their dressing-rooms before the
dinner, which took place as usual on the day of Dobbin's arrival.
George was too humane or too much occupied with the time of his neck-
loth to coney at once all the news to AMelia which his comrade had
brought with him from London. He came into her room, however, hold-
in the attorney's letter in his land, and with so solemn and important an
nir that his wife, always ingeniously on the watch for calamity, thought the
worst was about to befall, und running up to her husband, besought her
dearest George to tell her everything-he was ordered abroad; there
would be a battle next week-she knew there would.
Dearest George parried the question about foreign service, and withas
melancholy shake of the head said, : No, Emmy; it isn't that : it's not
myself I care about : it's you. I have and bad news from my father.
He refuses any communication with me; he has flung us off; and leaves
us to poverty. I can rough it well enough; but you, my dear, how will
you bent it rend here. And he handed her over the letter.
melia, with a look of tender alarm in her eyes, listened to her noble
hero as he uttered the above generous sentiments, and sitting down on the
bed, read the letter which George gave her with such a pompous martyr-
like air. Her face cleared up as she read the document, however. The idea
of sharing poverty and privation in company with the beloved object, is,
A NOEL WITHOUT A HER0.
21
as we have before suid, far from being disagroeable to a warm-hearted
woman. The notion was actually pleasant to little Amelia. Then, as usual,
she was ashamed of herself for feeling happy at such an indecorous moment,
and checked her pleasure, saying securely, ` O, George, how your poor
heart must bleed nt the idea of being separated from your papa.''
`'It does,'' said George, with an agonised eountenance
`` But he can't be angry with you long,'' she continued.  Nobody
would, I'm sure. le must forgive you, my dearest, kindest husband.
O, I shall never forgive myself if he does not,''
 What vexes me, my poor Emmy, is not my misfortune, but yours,''
George said. ``I don't care for a little poverty; and I think, without
vanity, I 've talents enough to make my own way.''
That you have,'' interposed his wife, who thought that war should
cease, and her husband should be made a general instantly.
 Yes, I shall make my way as well as another,'' Osborne went on;
`but you, my dear girl, how can I bear your being deprived of the com
forts and station in society which my wife had a right to expect Mg
dearest girl in barracks; the wife of a soldier in a marching regiment;
subject to all sorts of annoyance and privations It makes me miserable,''
Emmy, quite at ease, as this was her husband's only cause of disquiet,
took his hand, and with a radiant face and smile began to marble that
stanza from the favourite song of e Wapping Old Stairs,'' in which the
heroine, after rebuking her Tom for inattention, promises ``his browsers ta
mend, and his grog too to make,'' if he will be constant and kind, and not
forsake her. `Besides,'' she said, after a pause, during which she
looked as pretty and happy as any young woman fed, `` isn't two thou-
sand pounds an immense deal of money, GEorge''
George laughed at her naivete; and finally they went down to dinner,
Amelia clinging on George's arm, still wurbling the tune of ` Wapping Old
Stairs,'' and more pleased and light of mind than she had been for some
days past.
Thus the repast, which at length came off, instead of being dismal, was
an exceedingly brisk and merry one. The excitement of the campaign
counteracted in George's mind the depression occasioned by the disin-
writing letter. Dobbin still kept up his character of rattle. He amused
the company with accounts of the army in Belgium, where nothing but
fees and gaiety and fashion were going on. Then, having a particular
end in view, this dexterous captain proceeded to describe Mrs. Major
O'Dowd, packing her own and her Major's wardrobe, and how his best
epsulets had been stowed into a teas canister, whilst her of famous
yellow turban, with the bird of paradise wrapped in brown paper, was
locked up in the Major's tin cocked-hat case, and wondered what effect it
would have at the French king's court at Ghent, or the great military
balls at Brussels.
Ghent 1 Brussels'' tried out Amelia with a sudden shock and start.
Is the regiment ordered away, George,-is it ordered away?'' A look of
terror came over the sweet smiling face, and she clung to George as by an
instinct.
 Don't be afraid, dear,'' he said good-naturally;  '`it is but a twelve
hour's passage. It won't hurt you. You shall go, too, EMmy.''
216
YI FAIR.
I intend to go,'' said Becky, ` 'm on the staff. General Tufto isa
great flirt of mine. Is'not he, Rawdon''
Rawdon laughed out with his usual ron. William Dobbin flushed up
quite red. ` She can't go,'' he said; `` think of the-of the danger,'' he
was going to add; but had not all his conversation during dinner-time
tended to prove there was none Ie became very confused and silent.
I must and will go,'' Amelia cried with the greatest spirit ; and George,
applauding her resolution, patted her under the chin, and asked all the per-
sous present if they ever saw such a termagant of a wife, and agreed that
the lady should bear him company.  We'll have Mrs. O'Dowd to chaperon
you,'' he said. What cared she so long as her husband was near her ?
Thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was juggled way. Though
war and danger were in store, war and danger might not befal for months
to come. There was a respite at any rate, which made the timid little
Amelia almost as happy as a full reprieve would have done, and which even
Dobbin owned in his heart was very welcome. For, to be permitted to see
her was now the greatest privilege and hope of his life, and he thought with
himself secretly how he would watch and protect her. I wouldn't have
let her go if I had been married to her, he thought. But George was the
master, and his friend did not think it to remonstrate.
Putting her arm around her friend's waist, Rebecca at length carried
Amelia off from the dinner-table where so much business of importance
had been discussed, and left the gentleman in a highly exhilarated state,
drinking and talking very gnily.
In the course of the evening Rawdon got a little family-note from his
wife, which although he crumpled it up and burnt it instantly in the candle,
we had the good luck to read over Rebecca's shoulder. ` Great news,''
she wrote.  Mrs. Bute is gone. Get the money from Cupid to-night,
as he'll be off to-morrow most likely. Mind this.-R,'' So when the little
company was about adjoining to coffee in the women's apartment, Raw-
don touched Osborne on the elbow, and said gracefully, '` I sy, Osborne,
my boy, if quite convenient, I'll trouble you for that 'ers small tribe,'' It
was not quite convenient, but nevertheless George gave him a considerable
present instalment in bank notes from his pocket-book, and a bill on his
agents at a week's date, for the remaining sum.
This matter arranged, George, nd Jos, and Dobbin, held a council of
war over their cigars, and agreed that a general move should be made for
London in Jos's open carriage the next day. Jos, I think, would have
preferred staying until Rawdon Crawley quieted brighton, but Dobbin
and George overruled him, and he agreed to carry the party to tow,
and ordered four horses, as became his dignity. With these they set off
in state, after breakfast, the next day. Amelia had risen very early in the
morning, and packed her little trunks with the greatest alacrity, while
Osborne lay in bed deploying that she had not a mind to help her. She
was only too glad, however, to perform this office for herself. A dim
easy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already; and although
they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we know what
jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other virtues of her sex.
besides these characters who are coming and going away, we must

remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;
Miss Crawley, namely, and the site in attendance upon her. Now,
although Rebeces and her husband were but at a few stones' throw of the
lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawley occupied, the old lady's door
remained s tirelessly closed to them as it had been heretofore in London.
As long as she remained by the side of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bute
Crawley took care that her beloved Matilda should not be agitated by a
meeting with her nephew. When the spinster took her drive, the faithful
Mrs. Bute sate beside her in the carriage. When Miss Crawley took the
air in a chair, Mrs. Bute marched on one side of the vehicle, whilst honest
Briggs occupied the other wing. And if they met Rawdon and his wife
by chance-although the former constantly und obsequiously took off his
hat, the Miss-Crawley party passed him by with such a frigid and killing
indifference, that Rawdon began to despair.
We might as well be in London as here,'' Captain Rawlon often said,
with n downcast air.
` A comfortable inn in Brighton is better than a spunging-house in
Chaneery Lane,'' his wife answered, who was of a more cheerful tempera-
ment. " Think of those two aides-de-camp of Mr. Moses, the sheriff'a.

stupid, but Mr. Jos and Captain Cupid are better companions than Mr.
Moses's men, HRawdon, my love.''
I wonder the writs haven't followed me down here,'' Rawdon con-
tinted, still responding.
 When they do, we 'll find means to give them the slip,'' said dnuntless
little Geeky, and further pointed out to her husband the great comfort
and advantage of meeting Jos and Osborne, close acquaintance had
brought to Rawdon Crawley a most timely little supply of ready money.
 1t will hardly be enough to pay the inn bill,'' grumbled the Guardsman.
 Why need we pay it'' said the lady, who had an answer for every-
thing.
Through Rawdon's valet, who still kept up a trifling acquaintance with
the male inhabitants of Miss Crawley's servants' hall, and was instructed
to treat the coaching to drink whenever they met, old Miss Crawley's
movements were pretty well known by our young couple; and Rebecca
luckily bethought herself of being unwell, and of calling in the same
apothecary who was in attendance upon the spinster, so that their inform-
nation was on the whole tolerbly complete. Nor was Miss Briggs,
although forced to adopt a hostile attitude, secretly inimical to Rawdon
and his wife. She was naturally of a kindly and forgiving disposition.
Now that the cause of jealousy was removed, her dislike for Rebecca dis-
appeared also, and she remembered the latter's invariable good words and
good humour. And, indeed, she and Mrs. Firkin, the lady's-said, and
the whole of Miss Crawley's household, secretly gronned under the tyranny.
of the triumphant Mrs. Bute.
As often will be the case, that good but imperious woman pushed her
advantages too far, and her successes quite unmereifully. She had in
the course of a few weeks brought the invalid to such a state of helpless
docility,,that the poor soul yielded herself entirely to her sister's orders,
and did not even dare to complain of her slavery to Briggs or Firkin,
Mr. Bute measured out the glasses of wine which Miss Crawley was
daily allowed to take with irresistible accuracy, greatly to the annoyance
of Firkin and the butler, who found themselves deprived of control over
even the Sherry-bottle. She apportioned the sweet-breads, jellies,
chickens; their quantity and order. Night and noon and morning she
brought the abominable drinks ordained by the Doctor, and made her
patient swallow them with so affecting an obedience, that Firkin said my
poor Misses du take her physics like a lamb. She prescribed the drive in
the carriage or the ride in the chair, and, in a word, ground down the old
lady in her convalescenee in such a way as only belongs to your proper-
managing, motherly, moral would. If ever the patient faintly resisted,
and pleaded for a little bit more inner or a little drop less medicine, the
nurse threatened her with instantaneous death, when Miss Crawley in-
distant gave in,. ` She's no spirit left. in her,'' Firkin remarked to Briggs;
``she ain ave called me a fool these three weeks.'' Finally, Mrs. Bute
had made up her mind to dismiss the aforesaid honest lady's-maid, Mr,
Bowls the large confidential man, and Briggs herself, and to send for her
daughters from the Reetory, previous to removing the denr invalid bodily
to queen's Crawley, when an odious accident happened which called her
away from duties so pleasing. The Reverend Bute Crawley her husband,

riding home one night, fell with his horse and broke his collar-bone. Fever
and inflammatory symptoms set in, and Mrs. Bute was forced to leave
sousse. for hampshire. As soon as ever Bute was restored she promised
to return to her dearest friend, and deported, leaving the strongest injury-
tions with the household regarding their behaviour to their mistress; and
as soon as she got into the Southampton coach, there was such a jubilee and
sense of relief in all Miss Crawley's house, as the company of persons
assembled there had not experienced for many a week before. That very
day Miss Crawley left off her afternoon dose of medicine: that afternoon
Bowls opened an independent bottle of Sherry for himself and MIrs. Birkin :
that night Miss Crawley and Miss Briggs indulged in a game of piquet
instead of one of Porters's sermons. It was as in the old nursery-story,
when the stick forgot to beat the dog, and the whole course of events
underwent a peaceful and happy revolution.
At a very early hour in the morning, twice or thrice a week, Miss Briggs
used to retake herself to ns bathing-machine, and disport in the water in n
flannel gown, and an boiling cap. Rebecca, as we have seen, was aware of'
this circumstance, and though she did not attempt to storm riggs us she
had threatened, and actually dive into that lady's presence and surprise
her under the sacredness of the dawning, Mrs., kawdon determined to
attack Briggs as she came away from her bath, refreshed and invigoratel
hy her dip, and likely to be in good humour.
So, getting a very early the next morning, Becky brought the
telescope in their sitting-room, which faced the seas, to bear upon the
bathing-machines on the beach; saw Briggs arrive, enter her box, and put
out to sea; and was on the shore just as the nymph of whom she came in
quest stepped out of the little caravan on to the shingles. It was a pretty
picture: the beach; the hatching-women's faces ; the long line of rocks and
building were blushing and bright in the sunshine. Rebecca wore a kind,
tender smile on her face, and was holding out her pretty white hand as
Briggs emerged from the hour. What could Briggs do but accept the
salutation '
MIss Sh-, Mrs. Crawley,'' she said.
Mrs, Crawley seized her hand, pressed it to her heart, and with a sud-
den impulse, flinging her arms round bRiggs, kissed her affectionately.
'Dear, dear friend1'' she said, with a touch of such natural feeling, that
Miss Briggs of course at once began to melt, and even the bathing-woman
wss mollitied.
Rebecca found no difficulty in engaging Briggs in a long, intimate,
and delightful conversation. very thing that had passed since the more-
in of BEcky's sudden departure from Miss Crawley's house in Park
Lane up to the present day, and Mrs. Bute's happy retreat, was discussed
and described by Briggs. All Miss Crawley's symptoms, and the particu-
lars of her illness and medical treatment, were narrated by the confidante
with that fulness and accuracy which women delight in. About their
complaints and their doctors do ladies oer tire of talking to each other ?
Briggs did not on this occasion; nor did Rebecca weary of listening. She
was thankful, truly thankful, that the dear kind Briggs, that the faithful,
the invaluable Firkin, had been permitted to remain with their benefactor

through her illness. Heaven bless her though she, Rebecca, had seemed
to act undutifully towards Miss Crawley; yet was not her fault a natural
and exscusable one? Could she help giving her hand to the man who had
won hcr heart Briggs, the sentimental, could only turn up her eyes to
heaven at this appeal, and have a sympathetic sigh, and think that she,
too, had given away her affections long years ago, and own that Rebecca
was no very great criminal.
Cnn I ever forget her who so befriended the friendless orphanS No,
though she has cast me off,'' the latter said,  ``I shall never cease to love
her, and I would devote my life to her service. As my own benefuactress,
ns my beloved Rawdon's adored relative, I love and admire Miss Crawley,
dear Miss Briggs, beyond any woman in the world, and next to her I love
all those who are faithful to her. IT would never have treated MIss
Crawley's faithful friends as that olious designing Mrs. Bute had done.
Rawdon, who was all heart,'' Rebecca continued, `` although his outward
manners might seem rough and careless, had said a hundred times, with
tears in his eyes, that he blessed Heaven for sending his dearest Aunt two
such admirable nurses as her attached Firkin and her admirable Miss
BRiggs. Should the machinations of the horrible Mrs. Bute end, as she
too much feared they would, in banishing everybody that Miss Craw-
ley loved from her side, and leaving that poor lady a victim to those
harpics at the Rectory, Rebecca besought her (Miss bRiggs) to remember,
that her own home, humble as it was, was always open to receive bRiggs.
Denr fiend,'' she exclaimed, in a transport of enthusiasm, '` some courts
can uerer forget benefits; all women are not Bute CrawleysI hough why
should I complain of her,'' Rebecca added; `` though I have been her tool
and the victim to her arts, do I not owe my dearest Rawdon to her 2''
And Ilebeccn unfolded to Briggs all Mrs. Bute's conduct at Queen's
Crawley, which, though unintelligible to her then, was clearly enough
explained by the events now,-now that the attachment had sprung up
which AIrs. Bute had encouraged by a thousand artifices,-now the two
innocent people had fallen into the snares which she had laid for them,
and loved and married and been ruined through her schemes.
It was all very true. Briggs saw the stratagems as clearly as possible.
Mrs. Bute had made the match between Rawdon anl quebec. et,
though the latter was a perfectly innocent victim, Miss Briggs could not
disguise from her friend her fear that Miss Crawley's attentions were
hopelessly estranged from rebecca, and that the old lady would never
1forgive hcr nephew for making so imprudent a marriage.
On this point Rebecca had her own opinion, and still kept up a good
heart. If Miss Crawley did not forgive them at present, height at least
relent on a future day. Even now, there was only that ruling, sickly Pitt
Crawley between awdon and a baronetey; and should anything happen
to the former, all would be well. At all events, to have Mrs. HAute's
designs exposed, and herself well abused, was a satisfaction, and might bc
advantageous to rawdon's interest; and Rebecca, after an hour's that
with her recovered friend, left her with the most tender demonstrations of
regard, and quite assured that the conversation they had had together
would be reported to Miss Crawley before many hours were over.

This interview ended, it became full time for Rebecca to return to her
in, where all the party of the previous day were assembled at a farewell
breakfast. Rebecca took such a tender lead of Amelia as became two
women who loved each other as sisters; and having used her handkerchief
plentiful, and hung on her friend's neck as if they were parting for ever, and
waved the handkerchief (which was quite dry, by the way) out of window,
as the carriage drove off; she came back to the breakfast-table, and
note some prawns with a good deal of appetite, considering her emotion;
and while she was munching these delicacies, explained to Rawdon what
had occurred in her morning walk between herself and Briggs. Her hopes
were very high: sle made her husband share them. She generally suc-
ceded in making her husband share all her opinions, whether melancholy
or cheerful.
 You will now, if you please, my denr, sit down at the writing-table

you are a good boy, and that sort of thing.'' 8So Wilson site down, and
wrote off, ``Brighton, Thursday,'' and  My dear Aunt,'' with gret
rapidity : but there the gallant officer's imagination failed him. IIe
mumbled the end of his pen, and looked up in his wife's face. She could
not help laughing at his rueful countenance, and, marching up and down
the room with her hands behind her, the little woman began to dictate a
letter, which he took down.
` Before quitting the country and commencing a campaign, which very
possibly may be fatal,''
e What?'' said Ruwdon, rather surprised, but took the humour of the
phrase, and presently wrote it down with a grin.

interposed.

perhaps to return, once more to let me press the hand from which I have

 Kindness all my life,'' echoed lawson, scratching down the world,
and quite amazed at his own facility of composition.

see that he made no mistakes in spelling-`` bescech is not spelt with nna,

ledge of his little Misses.

Rebecca continued:I knew that Mrs. Bute Crowley confirmed and
encouraged it. But l1 make no reproaches. I married a poor woman, and
am content to abide by what I have done. Leave your property, dear
Aunt, as you will. I shall never complain of the way in which you dis-
pose of it. I would have you believe that I love you for yourself, and not

for money's sake. I want to be reconciled to you were I leave England.
Let me, let me see you before I go. A few weeks or months hence it may
be too late, and I cannot bear the notion of quitting the country without a
kind word of farewell from you.''
She won't recognize my style in that,'' said Becky. `I made the sen-
tenses short and brisk on purpose.'' And this authentic missive was dis-
patched under cover to Miss bRiggs.
Old Miss Crawley laughed when bRiggs with great mystery handed her
over this candid and simple statement.  We may read it now Mrs. But
is way,'' she said. `' Head it to me, Briggs.''
When Briggs had read the epistle out, her patroness laughed more.
Don't you see, you goose,'' she said to Briggs, who professed to be much
touched by the honest affection which pervaded the composition, ``Don't
you see that Bawdon never wrote a word of it. Ie never wrote to me
without asking for money in his life, and all his letters are full of bad
spelling, and dishes, and bad grammar. It is that little serpent of a
governess who rules him.'' They are all alike, Miss Crawley thought in
her heart. They all want me dead, and are lingering for my money.
I don't mind seeing Rawdon,'' she added, after a pause, and in a one
of perfect indifference.  I had just as soon shake hands with him as
not. Provided there is no scene, why shouldn't we meet I don't
mind. But human patience has its limits; and mind, my denr, I respect-
fully decline to receive Mrs. Rawlon-I can't support tat quite''-and Miss
riggs was fair to be content with this half-message of conciliation; and
thought that the best method of bringing the old lady and her nephew
together, was to warn Rawdon to be in waiting on the Clif, when Miss
Crawley went out for her air in her chair.
There they met. I don't know whether Miss Crawley had any private
feeling of regar:l, or emotion upon seeing her old favourite; but she held out
a couple of fingers to him with as smiling and good-humoured an air, as if
they had met only the day before. And as for awlon, he turned as red
as scarlet, and wrung off Briggs's hund, so great was his rapture and his
confusion at the meeting. Perhaps it was interest that moved him: or
perhaps affection: perhaps he was touched by the change which the illness
of the last weeks had brought in his aunt.
THe old girl has always acted like a trump to me,'' he said to his
wife, as he narrated the interview, `` and I felt, you know, rather queer,
and that sort of thing. I walked by the side of the what-dy'e-all-'em,
you know, and to her own door, where Bowls came to help her in.
And I wanted to go in very much, only-''

 No, my dear, I 'm hanged if I wasn't afraid when it came to tlc

Ilebeccn said.

was a fool, Becky, but you shouldn't say so;'' and he gave his wife
look, such as his countenance could wear when angered, and such as
was not pleasant to face.
A NOVEL WITT A HEB0.
 Well, dearest, to-morrow you must be on the look-out, and go and
see her, mind, whether she asks you or no,'' Rebecca said, trying to
soothe her angry yoke-mate. On which he replied, that he would do
exactly as he liked, and would just think her to keep a civil tongue in
her head-and the wounded husband went away, and passed the forenoon
at the billiard-room, sulky, silent, and suspicious.
But before the night was over he was compelled to give in, and of,
as usual, to his wife's superior prudence and foresight, by the most mela-
holy confirmation of the presentimeuts which she had regarding the
consequences of the mistake which he had made. Miss Crawley west
have had some emotion upon seeing him and shaking hands with him after
so long a rupture: She mused upon the meeting a considerable time.
`'Rawdon is getting very fat and old, riggs,'' she said to her eompa-
non. `` His nose has become red, and he is exceedingly course in appear-
ance. His marriage to that woman has hopelessly vulgarised him. Mrs.
Bute always said they drank together; and I have no doubt they do.
Yes: he smelt of gin abominably. I remarked it. Din't you''
In vain Briggs interposed, that Mrs. Bute spoke ill of everybody : and,
as far as a person in er humble position could judge, is an-
`An artful designing woman Yes, so she is, and she does speak ill
of every one,-but I am certain that woman has made Rawdon drink. All
those low people do--''
`He was very much affected at seeing you, In'a,'' the companion
said ; `` and I am sure, when you remember that he is going to the field of
danger--''
How much money has he promised you, Briggs '' the old spinstei
tried out, working herself into n nervous rage-''there now, of course you
begin to cry. I hate scenes. Why am I always to be worried Go and
cry up in your own room, and send Firkin to me,--to, stop, sit down and
blow your nose, and leave off crying, and write a letter to Captain Crawley.''
Poor Briggs went and placed herself obediently at the writing-book. Its
leaves were blotted all over with relics of the firm, strong, rapid and-
writing of the spinster's late amanuensis, Mrs. Bute Crawley.
``Begin `My lear sir,' or `' Dear sir,' that will be better, and say you are
desired by Mrs. Crawley-no, by Miss Crawley's medical an, by Mr.
Creamer, to state, that my health is such that all strong emotions would
be dangerous in my present delicate condition-and that I must decline
any family discussions or interviews whatever. And tank him for coming
to Brighton, and so forth, and beg him not to stay any longer on my
account. And, Miss Briggs, you may and that I wish him a on oyge,
and that if he will take the trouble to call upon my lawyer's in Grays Inn
Square, he will find there a communication for him. Yes, that will do;
and that will make him lead Brighton.'' The benevolent briggs penned
this sentence with the utmost satisfaction.
eTo seize upon me the very day after Mrs. Bute was gone,'' the old
lady rattled on; ``it was too indecent. Briggs, my dear, write to Mrs.
Crawley, and say ale nccdn't come back. No-she needn't-and sh
shan't-and I won't be a slave in my own house-and I won't be stared

and choked with poison. They all want to kill me-all-all''-and with
this the lonely old woman burst into a stream of hysterical tears.
The last scene of her dismal Vanity Fair comedy was fast approaching;
the tawdry lamps were going out one by one; and the dark curtain was
almost ready to descend,
That final paragraph, which referred Rawdon to Miss Crawley's solicitor
in London, and which Briggs had written so good-naturedly, consoled the
dragoon and his wife somewhat, after their first blank disappointment, on
reading the spinster's refusal of a reconciliation. And it elected the pur-
pose for which the old lady has caused it to be written, by making
lawson very eager to get to London.
Out of Jos's losing and George Osborne's bank-notes, he paid his
bill at the in, the landlord whereof does not probably know to this day
how doubtful his account once stood. For, as s general sends his bag-
gge to the year before an action, Rebecca and wisely packed up all their
chief valuables and sent them off under core of George's servant, who
went in charge of the trunks on the coach back to London. Rawdon and
his wife returned by the same conveyance next day.
I should have liked to see the old girl before we went,'' Rawdon said.
She looks so but up and altered that I 'm sure she can't last long. I
wonder what sort of a cheque I shall have at Waxy's. Two hundred-it
can't be less than two hundred,-hey Becky P''
In consequence of the repeated visits of the gentlemen whose portraits
nve been taken in a preceding page, Rawdon and his wife did not go
Make to their lodgings at hBrompton, but put up at an inn. Early the next
morning, Rebecca had an opportunity of seeing them as she skirted that
suburb on her road to old Mrs. Sedley's house at Fulham, whither she
went to look for her lens Amelia and her Brighton friends. They were all
off to Chatham, thence to harwich, to take shipping for Belgium with the
regiment-kind oll Mrs. Sedley very much depressed and tearful, solitary.
Returning from this visit, Rebecca found her husband, who had been off to
Gray's In, and learnt his fate. He came back furious.
`By Jove, Becky,'' says he, ``she's only given me twenty pounds''
Though it told against themselves, the joke was too good, and Beck
burst out laughing at Rawdon's discomfiture.

N quitting Brighton, our friend George
s became a person of rank and fashion
travelling in a barouche with four horses,
drove in state to a fine hotel in Caves-
lish square, where a suite of splendid
rooms, and a table magnificently fur-
wished with plate and surrounded by a
half-dozen of black and silent waiters,
was ready to receive the young gentle-
nan and his bride. George did the
honours of the place with a princely air
to Jos and Dobbin; and Amelia, for the
first time, and with exceeding shyness
nd timidity, presided at what George
George pooh-poohed the wine and bullied the writers royally, and
Jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction. Dobbin helped him to
it; for the lady of the house, before whom the tureen was placed, was so
ignorant of the contents, that she was going to help Mr. Sedley without
bestowing upon him either caliph or caliper.
The splendour of the entertainment, and the apartments in which it
was given, alarmed Mr. Dobbin, who remonstrated after dinner, when
Jos was asleep in the great chair. But, in vain he cried out against the
enormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an archbishop. I'e
always been accustomed to travel like a gentleman,'' George said, `" and,
dnamme, my wife small travel like a lady. As long as there's a shot in the
locker, sle shall want for nothing,'' said the generous fell. quite
pleased with himself for his magnificence of spirit. Nor did Dobbinu
try and convince him, that Amelia's happiness was not centred in
turtle-soup.
A while after dinner, Amelia timely expressed a wish to go and see
her mamma, at Fulham: which permission George granted her with some
grumbling. And she tripped away to her enormous bed-room, in the
centre of which stool the enormous unreal bed, `that the Emperor
Alexander's sister step in when the allied sufferings was here,' and put
on her little bonnet and shawl with the utmost eagerness and pleasure.
George was still drinking claret when she returned to the dining-room,

she asked him. No; he `dearest' had `business' that night. His mn

door of the hotel, Amelia male George a little disappointed curtsey after
looking vainly into his face once or twice, and went sadly down the great
staircase, Captain Dobbin after, who handed her into the vehicle, and
saw it drive away to its destination. The very valet was ashamed of
mentioning the address to the agency-coaching before the hotel-waiters,
and promised to instruct him when they got further on.
Dobbin walked home to his old quarters at the Slaughters', thinking
very likely that it would be delightful to be in that hackney-coach, along
with Mrs. Osborne. George was evidently of quite a different taste; for
when he had taken wine enough, he went off to half-price at the play, to
see Mr. Kent perform in Shylock. Captain Osborne was a great lover of
the drama, and had himself performed high-comedy characters with great
distinction in several garrison theatrical entertainments. Jos slept on
until long after dark, when he woke up with a start at the motions of
his servant, who was removing and emptying the decanter on the table;
and the hackme-coach stand was again put into requisition for a carriage
to convey this stout hero to his lodgings and bed.
Mrs. Sedley, you may be sure, clasped her daughter to her heart with
nll maternal eagerness and affection, ring out of the door as the carriage
rew up before the little garden-gate, to welcome the weeping, trembling,
young bride. Old Mr. Clapp, who was in his shirt-sleeves, trimming the
garden-plot, shrank baek alarmed. The Irish servant-lass rushed up from
the kitchen and smiled a God bless you.' Amelia could hardly walk
along the flags and nup thc steps into the parlour.
1How the floodgates were opened and mother and daughter wept, when
they were together embracing each other in this sanctuary, may readily be
imagined by every reader who possesses the least sentimental turn. When
don't ladies weep? At what occasion of joy, sorrow, or other business of
life? and, after such an event as a marriage, mother and daughter ere
surely at liberty to give way to an sensibility which is as tender as it is
refreshing. About a question of marriage I have seen women who hate
each other kiss and cry together quite loudly. How much more do they
feel when they love. Good mothers are married over again at their
daughters' weddings: and as for subsequent events, who does not know
how ultra-maternal grandmothers are?-in fact a woman, until she is a
grandmother, does not often really kuow want to be a mother is. Let us
respect Amelia and her mamma whispering and whimpering and Laughing
and crying in the parlour and the twilight. Oll Mr. Sedley did. He
had not divined who was in the carriage when it drove up. He had not
flown out to meet his daughter, though he kissed her very early when she
entered the room (where he was occupied, as usual, with his papers and
tapes and statements of accounts), and after sitting with the mother and
laughter for a short time, he very wisely left the little apartment in their
possession.

There were but nine days past since Mmeli lad left that little cottage

farewell. What a gulf lay between her and allat past life. She could
look back to it from her present standing-place,. and contemplate, almost
as another being, the young unmarried girl absorbed in her love, having
no eyes but for one special object, receiving parental affection if not in-
gratefully, at least indifferently, and as if it were her due-her whole
heart and thoughts but on the accomplishment of one desire. The review
of those days, so lately gne yet so far away, told her with shame; and
the aspect of the kind parents filled her with tender remorse. Was the

In honour of the young bride's arrival, her mother thought it necessary
to prepare i don't know what festive entertainment, and after the first
ebullition of talk, took leave of Mrs. George Osborne for a while, and dived
down to the lower regions of the house to a sort of kitchen-parlour
(occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Clapp, and in the evening, when her dishes
were washed and her curl-papers removed, by Miss Flanuigan the Irish
servant), there to take measures for the preparing of a magnificent rna-
rented tea. All people have their ways of expressing kindness, and it
seemed to Mrs. Sedley that n muffin and a quantity of orange marmalade
spread out in a little cut-glass saucer would be peculiarly agreeable refresh-
ments to Amelia in her most interesting situation.
While these delicacies were being transacted below, Amelia, leaving the
drawing-room, walked up stairs and found herself, she scarce knew how,
in the little room which she had occupied before her marriage, and in that
very chair in which she had passed so many bitter hours. She sank back

which she had knelt before marriage. Did she own to herself how different
the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?
It requires many many years-and a man must be very bad indeed-
before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession.
Then Rebecca's twinkling green eyes and baleful smile lighted upon her,
and fled her with dismay. And so she sate for awhile indulging in her
usual mood of selfish brooding, in that very listless melancholy attitude in
which the honest maid-servant had found her, on the day when she brought
up the letter in which George renewed his offer of marriage.
She looked at the little white bed, which had been hers a few days
before, and thought she would like to sleep in it that night, and wake, as
formerly, with her mother smiling over her in the morning. Then she
thought with terror of the great funereal mass pavilion in the vast and
dingy state bed-room, which was awaiting her at the grand hotel in Caves-
lish Square. Dear little white bed! how many a long night had she
went on its pillow How she had despaired and hoped to die there; and
now were not all her wishes accomplished, and the lover of whom she had
despaired her own for eer? Kind mothers how patiently aul tenderly
she had watched round that bed1 She went nnl knelt down by the bed-
side; and there this wounded and timorous, but gentle and loving soul,
sought for consolation, where as yet, it must be owned, our little girl had
but seldom looked for it. Love had been her faith hitherto; and the sad,
bleeding, disappointed heart, began to feel the want of another console.
Have we a right to repeat or to overhear her prayers These, brother,
are secrets, and out of the domain of Vanity Fair, in which our story lies.
But this may be said, that when the ten was finally announced, our
young lady came down stairs a great deal more cheerful ; that she did not
desponld, or deplore her fate, or think about George's coldness, or Rebecca's
eyes, as she had been wont to do of late. She went down stairs, and
kissel her father and mother, and talked to the old gentleman, and made
him more merry than he had been for many a day. She sat down at
the piano which Dobbin had bought for her, and sung over all her father's
favorite old songs. Sho pronounced the tca to be excellent, and praised
the exquisite taste in which the marmalade was arranged in the saucers.
And in determining to make everybody else happy, she found herself so;
and was sound asleep in the great funerenl pavilion, and only woke up with
a smile when George arrived from the theatre.
For the next day, George had more important `business' to transact
than that which took him to see Mr. Kean in Shylock. Immediately on
his arrival in London he had written off to his father's solicitors, signifying
his royal pleasure that an interview should take place between them on
the morrow. His hotel losses at billiards and cards to Captain Crawley had
almost drained the young man's purse, which wanted replenishing before
he set out on his travels, and he had no resource but to infringe upon the
two thousand pounds which the attorneys were commissioned to pay over
to him. He had a perfect holief in his own mind that his father would
relent before very long. IIow could any parent he obdurate for a length of
time against such a paragon as he was In his mere psst and personal

merits did not succeed in modifying the father, George determined that he
would distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that
the old gentleman must give in to him. And if not: Bahl the world
was before him. His luck might change at curls, and there was a lens of
spending in two thousand pounds.
So he sent off Amelia once more in a carriage to her mamma, with strict
orders and carte blanche to the two ladies to purchase everything requi-
site for a lady of Mrs. George Osborne's fashion, who was going on a
foreign tour. They had but one day to complete the outfit, and it may be
imagined that their business therefore occupied them pretty fully. In a
carriage one more, bustling about from nilliner to linendraer, escorted
back to the carrying by obsequious shopmen or polite ones, MIrs. Sedley
was herself again almost, and sincerely happy for the first time since their
misfortunes. Nor was MIrs. Amelia at all above the pleasure of shopping,
and bargaining, and seeing and buying pretty things. (Would any man,
the most philosophic, give twopence for a woman who was) She gac
herself a little treat, obedient to her husband's orders, and purchased a
quantity of lady's gear, showing a great deal of taste and elegant discern-
ment, is all the shopfolks said.
And about there that was ensuing, MIrs. Osborne was not much alarmed;
Bonaparte was to be crushed almost without a struggle. Margate packets
were sailing every day, filled with men of fashion and ladies of note, on their
way to Brussels and Ghent. PEople were going not so much to a war as
to a fashionable tour. The newspapers laughed the wretched upstart and
swindlers to scorn. Such a Corsican wretch as that withstand the armies
of Europe and the genius of the mortal Wellington Amelia held in
in utter contempt; for it needs not to be said that this soft and gentle
creature took her opinions from those people who surrounded her, such
fidelity being much too humble-minded to think for itself. Well, in a word,
she and her mother performed a great day's shopping, and she acquitted
herself with considerable liveliness and credit on this her first appearance
in the genteel world of London.
George meanwhile, with his hat on one side, his elbows squared, and
is swaggering martial nir, made for Bedford Row, and stalked into the
attorney's offices as if he was lord of every pole-faced clerk who was scribe-
bling thore. IIe ordered somebody to inform Mr. Higgs that Captain
Osborne was waiting, in a fierce and patronizing way, as if the peilin of an
attorney, who has thrice his brains, fifty times his money, and a thousand
times his experience, was a wretched underling who should instantly leave
all his business in life to attend on the Captain's pleasure. He did not
see the sneer of contempt which passed all round the room, from the first
clerk to the article gents, from the article gents to the ragged writers
and white-faced runners, in clothes too tight for them, as he sat there
tapping his boot with his cane, and thinking what a parcel of miserable
poor levels these were. The miserable poor devils knew all about his affairs.
1hey talked about them over their pints of beer at their public-house clubs
to other clerks of night. e Gods, what do not attorneys and attorneys'
clerks know in London Nothing is hidden from their inquisition, and

Perhaps George expected, when he entered Mlr. Films's apartment, to
find that gcutlean commissioned to give him some message ol compro-
rise or conciliation for his father; perhaps his hauglty anl cold
demeanour was adopted as a sign of his spirit and resolution: but if so,
his fierceness was met by a chilling consoles and indifference on the
attorney's part, that rendered swaggering absurd. he pretended to be
writing at a paper, when the Captain entered. `` Pry, sit down, Sir,''
said he, ``and I will attend to your little affair iu moment. Mr. loe,
get the release papers, if you please;'' and then he fell to writing again.
Poe having produced tose papers, his chief calculated the count of
two thousand pounds stock at the rate of the day; and asked Captain
Osborne whether he would take the sum in a cheque upon the bankers,
or whether he should direct the latter to purchase stock to that out.
 One of the lute MIrs. Osborne's trustees is out of town,'' he said india-
ferently, ``but my client wishes to meet your wishes, and have done
with the business as quick as possible.''
Give me a cheque, Sir,'' said the Captain very usually. `Damn thc
shillings and alliance, Sir,'' he added, as the lawyer was making out the
amount of the draft; and, flattering himself that by this stroke of g-
unanimity he had put the old quiz to the blush, he stalked out of his office
with the paper in his pocket.

HEN Jos's fine carriage drove up to
the inn door at Chatham, the first face
which Amelia recognized was the
friendly couutenance of Captain Dob-
bin, who had been facing the street
for an hour past in expectation of
his friends' arrival. The Captain, with
shells on his frock-boat, and a crimson
sash and sabre, presented a military
appearance, which made Jos quite
proud to be able to claim such an
acquaintance, and the stout civilian
hailed him with a cordiality very
different from the reception which
Jos vouchsafed to his friend in.
Brighton and Bond Street.
Along with the Captain was Ensign
Stubble; who, is the barouche neared
the inn, burst out with an exclamation
of ' By Novel what a pretty girl'' highly appealing Osborne's choice.
Indeed, SOmalia dressed in her wedding-precise and pink ribbons, with a
flush in her face, occasioned by rapid travel through the open air, looked
so fresh and pretty, as july to justify the Ensign's compliment. Dobbin
liked him for making it. As he stepped forward to help the lady out of
the carriage, Stubble saw what a pretty little hand she gave him, and
what a sweet pretty little foot came tripping down the sep. He brushed
profusely, and made the very best bow of which he was capable; to which
amelia, seeing the number of the -th regiment embroidered on the
Ensign's cap, replied with n blushing smile, and na curtsey on her part;
which finished the young Ensign on the spot. Dobbin took most kindly
to Mr. Stubble from that day, and encouraged him to talk about Amelia
in their private walks, and at each other's quarters. It became the fashion
indeed among all the honest young fellows of the -th to adore and
admire Mrs, Osborne. TIer simple artless behaviour, and modest kindness
of demeanour, won all their unsophisticated hearts; all which simplicity
and sweetness are quite impossible to describe in print. But who has
not beheld these among women, and recognized the presence of all sorts
of qualities in them, even though they say no more to you than that
they are engaged to dance the next quadrille, or that it is very lot
weather? George, always the champion of his regiment, rose immensely

in the opinion of the youth of the corps, by his gallantry in marrying this
motionless young creature, and by his choice of such a pretty king
partner.
In the sitting-room which was awaiting the travellers, Amelia, to her
surprise, found a letter addressed to Mrs. Captain Osborne. It was a
triangular billet, on pink paper, and sealed with a dove and an olive
branch, and a profusion of light-blue sealing wax, and it was written in a
very large, though undecided female hand.
I's Peggy ODosd's fst,'' said Gorge, laughing. `'Now it by the
kisses on the seal.'' And in fact, it was a note from Mrs. Major O'Dowd,
requesting the pleasure of Mrs. Osborne's company that very evening to
a small friendly party. eTon must go,'' George suid. e You will make
acquaintance with the regiment there. O'Dowd goes in command of the
regiment, and eggy goes in command of O'Dow.''
But they had not been for many minutes in the enjoyment of Mrs.
O'Down's letter, when the door was flung open, and a stout jolly lady, in
a riding-habit, followed by a couple of officers of Ours, entered the room.

Sure, I couldn't stop till tay-time. Present me, Large, my dear fellow,
to your ldy. Madam, I 'm delighted to see he; and to present to you
me husband, Mecjor O'Dowd;'' and with this, the jolly lay in the riding-
habit grasped Amelia's hand very warmly, and the latter know at once
that the lady was before her whom her husband had so often laughed at.
You 've often heard of me from that husband of yours,'' said the lady
with great vivacity.
 ou 've often heard of her,'' echoed her husband, the Major.
Amelia answered, smiling, ``that she had.''
:And small good he 's told you of me,'' Mrs. O'Dowd replied; adding
that ``George was a wired drive,''
tHat I 'll go bail for,'' said the Major, trying to look knowing, at which
George laughed; and Mrs. O'Dowd, with a top of her whip, told the
Major to be quite; and then requested to be presented in for to MIrs.
Captain Osborne.
 This, my dear,'' ssid George with great gravity, ``is my very good,
king, and excellent friend, Auralia Mlargaretta, otherwise called Peggy.''
 1Faith, you 're right,'' interposed the Major.
. Otherwise called eggy, lady of Major Michael O'Dowd of our regis-
ment, and daughter of Fitzjurld Ber'ford de Burgh Malone of Glen-
along, County Kildnre.''
`And Maryan Queer, Doblin,'' said the lady with calm superiority.
`And Maryan square, sure enough,'' the Major whispered.
'was there ye courted me, Meejor, dear,'' the lady said; and the
MInor assented to this as to every other proposition which was made
generally in company.
Major O' Dowd, who has served his sovereign in every quarter of thelwald,
and had paid for every step in his profession by some more than equiva-
lent act of daring and gallantry, was the most molest, silent, sheen-laced
and meek of little men, and as obedient to his wife as if he had been her
tay-boy. At the mess-table he cute silently, and rank a great deal. When
full of liquor, he reeled silently home. When he spoke, it was to agree
with everybody on every conceivable point; and he passed through life in
perfect ense anl good humour. The hottest suns of India never heated
is temper; and the Walther ague never shook it. He walked up to a
battery with just as much indifference as to a dinner-table; had dine on
horse-flesh and turtle with equal relish and appetite; and had an old
mother, Ms. O'Dowd of DOwntown indeed, whom he had never dis-
obeyed but when he ran away and enlisted, and when he persisted in
marrying that odious Peggy Malone.
Peggy was one of five sisters, and eleven children of the noble house
of Glenmalony; but her husband, though her own cousin, was of the
mother's side, and so had not the intestinal advantage of being allied to
the Lowest, whom she believed to be the most famous film in the
world. Having tried nine seasons at Dublin and two st Bath and Chel-
denham, and not finding a partner for life, Mies Malone ordered her
cousin Mick to marry her when she was about thirty-three years of age;
and the honest fellow obeying, carried her off to the West Indies to preside
over the ladies of the -th regiment, into which he had just exchanged.

Before Mrs. O'Dowd was half an hour in Armenia's (or indeed in anybody
else's) company, this amiable ldy told all her birth ad pedigree to her
new friend. `` MIy denr,'' said she, good-naturedly, ``it was my intention
that Large should be a brother of my own, and my sister Gloria would
have suited hi entirely. Dut ns bygones are bygones, and he was
engaged to yourself, why, I'm determined to take you as a sister instead,
and to look upon you as such, and to love you as one of the family.
Faith, you've got such a nice good-natured face and way wide you, that
I 'm sure we 'll agree; and that you 'll be an addition to our family any-
way,''
i'Feel and she will,'' said O'Down with an approving air, and Amelia
felt herself not a little amused and grateful to be thus suddenly introduced
to so large a party of relations,
wE 're all good fellows here,'' the Major's lady continued. There's
not a regiment in the service where you 'll find a more united society nor
a more agreeable mess-room. There 's no quarrelling, bickering, land-
thering, nor small talk amongst as. We all love each other.''
 Especially Mrs. Images,'' suid George, laughing.
` Mrs. Captain Images and he has made up, though her treatment of
me would bring me gray hairs with sorrow to the true.''
`And you with such a beautiful front of black, Peggy my dear,'' the
Major cried.
 Would your tongue, Nick, you booby. Them husband are always in
the way, Mrs. Osborne, my dear; and as for my Mik, I often tell him he
should never open his mouth but to give the word of command, or to put
meat and drink into it. I 'Ll tell you about the regiment, and warn you
when we 're alone. Introduce me to your brother now; sure he's a mighty
fine man, and reminds me of me cousin Dan Malone (Mnlony of Ballads-
long, my dear, you know, who mur'icd Ophelia Scully, of Oystherstown,
own cousin to Lord Poldoody). Mr. Sedley, Sir, I 'm delighted to be
made known to be. I suppose you'll die at the mess to-day. (Mind
that driver of a docther, ick, and whatever ye du, keep yourself sober for
me party this evening.)
It's the 150th gives us a farewell dinner, my love,'' interposed thc
Major, `` but we'll easy get a card for Mr. Sedley.''
`Bun sImple (sign Simple, of Ours, my dear Amelia. I forgot to
introjuiee him to be.) Run in a hurry, with Mra. Major O'Dowd's
compliments to Colonel Taish, and Captain Osborne has brought his
brothernlaw down, and will bring him to the 150th mess at five o'clock
sharp-when you and lI, my clear, will take a snack here, if you like.''
Before Mrs. O'Down's speech was concluded, the you sign was
trotting down stairs on his commission.
 Obedience is the soul of tlc army. We will go to our duty while
Mrs. O'Dowd will stay and enlighten you, my,'' Captain Osborne said;
and the two Captains, taking each a wing of the Major, walked out with
that officer, grinning at each other over his head.
Ad, now having her new friend to herself, the impetuous Mrs, O'Dowd
projected to pour out such a quantity of information as no poor little
von's memory could ever tax itself to bear. She told Amelia a thousand

particulars relative to the very numerous family of which the amazed
young lady found herself a member. :Mrs. Hecavytop, the Colonel's
wife, died in Jamaica of the yellow fever and a broken heart combined,
for the horrid old Colonel, with a head as bad as a cannon-ball, was
making sheep's eyes at a half-caste girl there. Mrs. Images, though
without education, was a good woman, but she had the driver's tongue,
and would cheat her own mother at whist. Mrs. Captain Kirk must
turn up her lobster eyes forsyth at the idea of an honest round game,
(wherein me father, as pious a man s eer went to church, me uncle
Dane Malone, and our cousin the Billion, took a hand at low, or whist,
every night of their lives). Father of 'm's going with the regiment this
time,'' Mrs. O'Dowd added. Fanny Images stops with her mother, who
sells small coal and potatoes, most likely, in Islington-town, hard by
London, though she's always bragging of her father's ships, and pointing
them out to us as they go up the river: and Mrs Kirk and her children
will stop here in Bethesda Place, to be nigh to her favourite preacher,
Dr. Ramshorn. MIrs. Bunny 's in an interesting situation-faith, and she
always is, then-and has given the Lieutenant seven already. And
Ensign Porky's wife, who joined two months before you, my dear, has
quark'd with Tom Porky a score of times, till you can hear 'em all over

Where did we get your finishing, my dear I had moin, and no expense
spared, at MAdame Flanahan's, at Issues Grove, Booterstown, near
Dublin, wid a Marchioness to teach us the true Parisian pronunciation,
and a retired Major-General of the French service to put us through the
exercise.''
Of this incongruous family our astonished Amelia found herself all of
a sudden a member: with More, O'Dowd as an elder sister. She was pre-
rented to her other female relations at tea-time, on whom, as she was
quiet, good-natured, and not too handsome, she made rather an agreeable
impression until the arrival of the gentlemen from the mass of the l50th,
who all admired her so, that her sisters began, of course, to find fault
with her.
e I hope Osborne has sown his wild ones,'' said Mrs. AGencies to Mrs.
Bunny.  If a reformed rake makes a good husband, sure it's she will
have the fine chance with Large,'' Mrs. O'Dowd, remarked to Pesky, who
had lost her position as bride in the regiment, and was quite angry with
the usurper. And, as for Mrs. Kirk; the disciple of Dr. Ramshorn put
one or two leading professional questions to AMelia, to see whether she was
awakened, whether she was a professing Christian and so forth, and finding
from the simplicity of MIrs. Osborne's replies that she was yet in utter
darkness, put into her hands three little penny books with pictures, viz. the
Howling Wilderness,'' tho  WVasherwoman of Wanlsworth Common,''
and the `` British Soldier's best Bayonet,'' which, bent upon awakening
her before she slept, Mrs. Kirk begged Amelia to read that night were she
went to bed.
But all the men, like good fellows ns they were, rallied round their

comrade's pretty wife, and paid her their court with soldierly gallantry.
She had a little triumph, which flushed her spirits unl made her eyes
sparkle. George was proud of her popularity, and pleased with the
manner (which was very gy and graceful though naive and a little timid)
with which she received the gentlemen's attention, and answered their
compliments. And he in his uniform-how much handsome he was than
any man in the room She felt that he was affectionately watching her,
and glowed with pleasure at his kindness. ` I will make all his friends
welcome,'' she resolved in her heart. I will love all who love him. I
will always try and be gay and good-humoured and make his home
happy.''
The regiment indeed adopted her with acclamation. The Captains
approved, the Lieutenants applauded, the knsigns admired. Old Cutler
the Doctor made one or two jokes, which, being professional, need not be
repeated; and Cackle, the Assistant M.bD. of Edinburgh, condescended to
examine her upon literature, and tried her with his tee best French
quotations. oung Stubble went about from man to man whispering,
Jove, isn't the a pretty galt'' and never took his eyes off her except
when the nexus came in.
As for Captain DOing, he never so much as spoke to her during the
whole evening. bUt he and Captain Porter of the 150th took home Jos
to the hotel, who was in a very maudlin state, and had told his tiger-hunt
story with great effect, both at the mess-table ; and at the source, to Mrs.
O'Down in her turban and bird of paradise. LIving put the Collector
into the lands of his servant, Dobbin bothered about, smoking his cigar
before the inn door. George had meanwhile very carefully shaped his
wife, and brought her away from MIrs, O'Dowd's after a general hand-
shaking from the young officers, who accompanied her to the f, and
cleaner that vehicle as it lore off. So Amelia gave Dobbin her little
hand as she got out of the carriage, and rebuked im seemingly for not
having taken any notice of her all night.
The Captain continued that deleterious amusement of smoking, lng
after the inn and the street were gone to bed. IIc watched the lights
vanish from George's sitting-room windows, and shine out in the bel-
room close at hand. It was almost morning when he returned to his
own quarters. IIe could hear the cheering from the ships in the river,

pretty much unencumbered to Ramsgate, where there were plenty of
packets plying, in one of which they had a speedy passage to Ostend.
That period of Jos's life which now ensued was so full of incident, that
it served him for conversation for many years after, and even the tiger-
hunt story was put aside for more stirring narratives which he had to tell
about the great campaign of Waterloo. As soon as he had agreed to
escort his sister abroad, it was remarked that he ceased shaving his upper
lip. At Chatham he followed the parades and drills with great assiduity.
lle listened with the utmost attention to the conversation of his brother
officers, (as he called them in after days sometimes,) and learned as many
military names as he could. In these studies the excellent Mrs. O'Dowd
was of great assistance to him; and on the day finally when they embarked
on board the Lovely Rose which was to carry them to their destination, he
made his appearance in a breed frock-coat and duck browsers, with a
foraging cap ornamented with a smart gold bnd. HAving his carriage

He suffered hugely on the voyage, during which the ladies were likewise
prostrate; but Amelia was brought to life again as the packet made

entered the harbour almost at the same time with the Lovely Rose.
Ios went in a collapsed state to an in, while Captain Dobbin escorted the
ladies, and then busied himself in freeing Jos's carriage and luggage from
the ship and the customhouse, for Mr, Jos was at present without a ser-
want, Osborne's man and his own pampered menial having conspired
together at Chatham, and refused point-blank to cross the water. This
revolt, which came very suddenly, and on the last day, so alarmed Mr,
Sedley, junior, that he was on the point of giving up the competition, but
Captain Dobbin (who made himself immensely officials in the business,
Is said), rated him and laughed at him soundly: the stanchions were
grown in advance, and Jos finally was persuaded to embark. In place
of the well-bred and well-fed London domestic, who could only speak
English, Dobbin procured for Jos's party a smartly little Belgian servant
who could speak no language at all; but who by his bustling behaviour,
and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley ns ` My lord,'' special acquired
that gentleman's favour. times are altered at Ostend now; of the Britons
who go thither, very few look like lords, or act like those members of our
hereditary aristocracy. They seem for the most part shabby in attire,
dingy of linen, lovers of billiards and brandy, nd cigars aud greasy
ordinaries.
But it may be said as a rule, that every ENglishman in the Duke of
Wellington's army paid his wny. The remembrance of such a fact
surely becomes a nation of shopkeepers. It was a blessing for a com-
merce-loving country to be overrun by such an army of customers: and
to have such creditable warriors to feel. And the country which they
came to protect is not military. For a long period of history they have
let other people fight thero. When the present writer went to survey
with eagle glance the field of Waterloo, we asked the conductor of the
diligence, a portly warlike-looking veteran, whether he had been at the
battle.  Pas si ite''-such an answer and sentiment as no Frenchman
would own to-was his reply. But on the other hand, the position who
drove us was n scout, a son of some bankrupt Imperial General, who
accepted a pennyworth of her on the read. The moral is surely a
good one.
This flat, flourishing, easy country never could she looked more rich
and prosperous, than in that opening summer of 1815, when its green
fields and quiet cities were enlivened by multiplied red-coats: when its
wide classes swarmed with brilliant eNglish equipages: when its
great canal-boats, gliding by rich pastures and pleasant quaint old vil-
ages, by old chateaux lying amongst old trees, were all crowded with
well-to-do English travellers: when the soldier who drink at the village
in, not only drank, but paid his score; and Donald the Hlighlander,

and Jeannette were out getting in the hay. As our painters are bent on
military subjects just now, I throw out this as a good subject for the
pencil, to illustrate the principle of an honest English war. All looked as
brilliant and harmless as a Hyde Park review. Meanwhile, Napoleon
screened behind his curtain of frontier-fortresses, was preparing for the
outbreak which is to drive all these orderly people into fury and blood;
andlay so many of the low.
Everybody had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader (for the
resolute faith which the Duke of Wellington had inspired in the whole
English nation was as intense, as that more frantic enthusiasm with which
at one time the French regarded Napoleon), the country seemed in so per-
fect a state of orderly defence, and the help at hand in case of need so near
and overwhelming, that alarm was unknown, and that our travellers, among
whom two were naturally of a very timid sort, were, like all the other multi-
plied English tourists, entirely alt case. he famous regiment, with so
many of whose officers we have made acquaintance, was drafted in canal-

must remember for the luxury and accommodation they afforded. So
psrodigiously good was the eating and drinking on board these sluggish
but most comfortable vessels, that there are legends extant of an English
traveller who coming to Belgium for a week, and travelling in one of these
boats, was so delighted with the fire there that he went backwards and
forwards from Ghent to Bruges perpetually until the railroads were
invented, when he drowned himself on the last trip of the passage-boat.

lastly to the ladies.
His courage was prodigious. ` Boney attack us/'' he tried.  My
dear creature, my poor Emmy, don't be frightened. There's no longer.
The allies will be in Paris in two months, I tell you: when I'll take you
to dine in the Palais Royal, by Jove. There are three hundred thousand
Rooshians, I tell you, now entering France by Absence and the Rhine-
three hundred thousand under Wittgenstein anl bArclay de Holly, my poor
love. You don't know military affairs, my car. I do, and I tell you
there's no infantry in France can stand against looshian infantry, and no
general of Money's that 's it to hold a candle to Wittgenstein. Then
there are the Austrians, they are five hundred thousand if a man, and
they are within ten marches of the frontier by this time under Schwartzen-
berg and Prince Charles. Then there are the Prooshians under the
gallant Prince Marshal., Show mc a century chief like him now that
Murat is gone. Hey, Mrs. O'Doubt Do you think our little girl here
need be afraid. Is there any cause for fear, Isidor? IIey, Sir? Get
some more beer.''
Mrs. O'Dowd said that her Gloria was not afraid of any man alive
let alone a Frenchman,'' and tossed off a glass of beer with a win which
expressed her liking for the beverage.
HAving frequently been in presence of the enemy, or, in other words,
faced the Ladies nt Cheltenham anl Bath, our friend, the Collector, had
lost a great deal of his pristine timidity, and was now, especially when
fortified with liquor, as talktive as might be. He was rather a favourite
with the regiment, treating the young officers with sumptuously, and
amusing them by his military airs. And as there is one well-known
regiment of the army which travels with a gout heading the column,
whilst another is led by a deer, George said with respect to his brother-
in-law, that his regiment marched with an elephant.
Since Amelia's introduction to the regiment, George began to be rather
ashamed of some of the company to which he had been forced to present
her; and determined, as he told Dobbin (with what satisfaction to the
latter it need not be said), to exchange into some better regiment soon,
and to get his wife away from these damned vulgar would. But this
vulgarity of being ashamed of one's society is much more common among
men than women; (except very great ladies of fashion, who, to be sure,
indulge in it;) and Mrs. Amelia, a natural and unaffected person, had
none of that artificial shamefaeedness which her husband mistook for deli-
cary on his own part. Thus Mrs. O'Dowd and a cock's plume in her hat,
and a very large ``repeaters'' on her stomach, which she used to ring on
all occasions, narrating how it had been presented to her by her father, as
the stint into the car'ge after her mur'ge; and these ornaments, with
other outward peculiarities of the Major's wife, gave excruciating agonies
to Captain Osborne, when his wife and the Major's came in contact;
whereas Amelia was only amused by the honest lady's eccentricities, and
not in the least ashamed of her company.
As they made that well-known journey, which almost every Englishman
of middle rank has travelled since, there might have been more instructive,

And Jos owned with a sign, '`that for good streaky beef, really mingled
with fat and lun, there was no country like England.''

MInor's lady; proceeding, is is not unusual with patriots of her nation,
to make comparisons greatly in favour of her own country. The idea of
comparing the market nt bruges with those of bDulin, although she had
suggested it herself, caused immense scorn and derision on her part.
I 'Il thank me to tell me what they mean by that old gzabo on the

and no enemy in front. WHen our travellers arrived at Brussels, in which
their regiment was quartered, n great piece of good fortune, as all said,
they found themselves in one of the gamest nd most brilliant little capitals
in eUrope, and were all the Vanity Fair boots were laid out with the
most tempting liveliness and splendour. ambling was here in profusion,
and dancing in plenty : feasting was there to fill with delight that great
gourmand of a Job: there was a theatre where a miraculous Catalan was
delighting all heurers; beautiful rides, all enlivened with martial splendour;
a rare old city, with strange costumes and wonderful architecture, to
delight the eyes of little Amelia, who had never before scan a foreign
country, and fill her with charming surprises: so that now and for a few
weeks' space, in a fine handsome lodging, whereof the expenses were borne
by Jos and Osborne, who was flush of money and full of kind attentions to
his wife-for about a fortnight I sy, during which her honeymoon ended,
MIrs. Amelia was as pleased an happy as any little bride out of England.
Every day during this happy time there was novelty and amusement
for all parties. There was a church to see, or a picture gallery-there
was a ride, or an opera. The bands of the regiments were making music
at all hours. THe greatest folks of England walked in the park-there
as a perpetual military festival. George taking out his wife to a new
jaunt or junket every night, was quite pleased with himself as usual, and
swore he was becoming quite a domestic character. And ajaunt or ajuuket
with him/ Was it not enough to see this little heart beating without Iler
letters home to her mother were filled with delight and gratitude at this
season. Her husband bade ler buy laces, millinery, jewels, and gimcracks
of all sorts. Oh, he was the kindest, best, and most generous of end
The sight of the very great company of lords and ladies and fashionable
persons who thronged the town and appeared in every public place, filled
George's truly British soul with intense delight. `They flung off that
happy frigidity and inseolence of demeanour which occasionally characterises
the great at home, and appearing in numberless public places, condescended
to mingle with the rest of the company whom they met there. One night
at a party given by the general of the division to which George's regiment
belonged, he and the honour of dancing with Lady Blanche Thistlewood,
Lord Breaches' daughter; he bustled for ccs and refreshments for the
two noble lies; he pushed and squeezed for Lady reaches' carriage;
he bragged about the Countess when he got home, in a way which his
own father could not have surpassed. IIe called upon the ladies the next
day; he rode by their side in the Park; he asked their party to a great
winner nt a restaurateur's, and was quite wild with cxultution when they
agreed to come. Old Breaches, who hal not much pride and a large
appetite, would go for a dinner anywhere.
I hope there will be no women besides our own party,'' Lay Bare-
acres said, after reflecting upon the invitation which lad been made, and
accepted with too much precipitancy.
``Gracious Heaven, Mamma-you don't suppose the man would bring
his wife,'' shielded Lady Blanco, who had been languishing in George's
arms in the newly-imported waltz for hours the night before. Tha

VANITY FAIR.
 Wife, just married, des'lish pretty woman, I hear,'' the old Earl
said.
 Well, my dear Blanche,'' said the mother, ``I suppose ns Papa wants
to go, we must go: but we needn't know them in england, you know.''
And so, determined to cut their new acquaintance in Bond Street, these
great folks went to eat his dinner nat Brussels, and condescending to
make him pay for their pleasure, showed their dignity by making his
wife uncomfortable, and carefully excluding her from the conversation.
This is a species of dignity in which the high-bred british female
reigns supreme. To watch the behaviour of a fine lady to other and
humble women is a very good sport for a philosophical frequented of
Vanity Fir.
This festival, on which honest George spent a great deal of money, was
the very smallest of all the entertainments which Amelia had in her
honey-moon. He wrote the most tenuous accounts of the feast home to
her mamma: how the Countess of Breaches would not answer when
spoken to; how Lady Blanche stared at her with her eye-glass; and
what a rage Captain Dobbin was in at their behaviour; and how my
lord as they came away from the feast, asked to see the bill, and pro-
bounced it a d- bad dinner, and d- denr. But though Amelia told all
these stories, and wrote home regarding her guests' rudeness, and her own
discomfiture; old Mrs. Sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless, and
talked about Emmy's friend, the Countess of Breaches, with such assi-
laity that the news how his son was entertaining Peers and Peeresses
actually came to Osborne's years in the City.
Those who know the present Lieutenant-General Sir George Tufto,
K.C.B., and have seen him, as they may on most days in the season,
padded and in stays, strutting down Pall-Mall with a ricketts swagger on
his high-heeled lacquered boots, leering under the bonuets of passers by,
pr riding n showy chestnut, and ogling Broughams in the Parks-those
who know the present Sir George Tufto would hardly recognise the
ring Peninsula and Waterloo officer. He has thick curling brown hair
and black eyebrows now, and his whiskers are of the deepest purple. He
was light-haired and bald in 18l5, and stouter in the person and in the
limbs, which especially have shrunk very much of late. When he was
about seventy years of age (he is now nearly eighty), his hair, which was
very scarce and quite white, suddenly grew thick, and brown, and curly,
and his whiskers and eyebrows took their present colour. Ill-natured
people say that his chest is all wool, and that his hair, because it neer gros,
isa wig. Tom Tufto, with whose father he quarrelled ever so many years
ago, declares that Mademoiselle de Jaisey, of the French theatre, pulled his
grandpaspa's hair off in the green-room; but Tom is notoriously spiteful
and jealous; and the General's wig has nothing to do with our story.
One day, as some of our friends of the -th were scattering in the
flower-market of Brussels, having been to see the Hotel de Ville, which
Mrs. Major O'Dowd declared was not near so large or handsome as her
father's mansion of Glenmalony, an officer of rank with an orderly behind
him, rode up to the market, and descending from his horse, came amongst
the flowers, and selected the very finest bouquet which money could by.

The beautiful bundle being tied up in a paper, the officer remounted, giving
the nosegay into the charge of his military groom, who carried it with
grin, following his chief who rode away in great state and self-satis-
faction.
 You should see the flowers at Glenmalony,'' Mrs. O'Dowd was remark-
ing. ' Mce father has three Scotch garners with niue helpers. We lve
nn acre of lot-houses, and pines ns common as days in the samson. Our
greeks weighs six pounds every bunch of 'em, nand upon me honour and
conscience I think our magnolias is as big as taykettles,''
Dobbin, who never used to `draw out' Mrs. O'Dowd as that wicked
Osborne delighted in doing, (much to Amelia's terror, who implored him
to spare her,) fell back in the crowd, crowing and sputtering until he
reached a safe distance, when he exploded amongst the astonished market-
people with shrieks of yelling laughter.
What. 's that gawky juggling about'' sin Mrs. O'Dow. `Is it his

have popped all the blood out of um. An't the magnolias at Glenmalony

Died then they are, and bigger, Peggy,'' the Major said. When the
conversation was interrupted in the manner stated by the arrival of the
officer who purchased the bouquet.
`Devlish fine horse,-who is it2'' George asked.
You should see me brother Molloy Moloney's horse, Molasses, that
won the top at the Courage,'' the Major's wife was exclaiming, and was
continuing the family history, when her husband interrupted her by
saying-
It 's General Tufto, who commands the - cavalry division;'' adding
quietly, ' he and I were both shot in the same leg at Tulsvern.''
Where you got your step,'' said George with a laugh. '" General Tufto
Then my dear the Crawleys are come.''
Amelia's heart fell,-she knew not why. The sun did not seem to
shine so bright. The tall oll roofs and gables looked less picturesque all
of a sudden, though it was a brilliant sunset, and one of the brightest and
most beautiful days at the end of May.

is open carriage, with which cattle,
and the smart London vehicle, he
made a very tolerable figure in the
dries about Brussels. George
purchased a horse for his private
riding, and he and Captain Dobbin
would often accompany the carriage
in which Jos and his sister took
daily excursions of pleasure. They
went out that day in the park for
their accustomed diversion, and
there, sure enough, George's re-
mark with regard to the arrival of
Rnwdon Crawley and his wife
proved to be correct. In the midst
of a little troop of horsemen, con-
listing of some of the very greatest persons in Brussels, Rebecca was seen
in the prettiest and tightest of riding-habits, mounted on a beautiful little
Arab, which the role to perfection (having acquired the art at queen's
Crawley, where the Baronet, Mr. Pitt, and Rawdon himself had given her
many lessons), and by the side of the gallant General Tufto.
Sure, it's the Juke himself,'' cried MIrs. Major O'Dowd to Jos, who
began to blush violently; ``and that 's Lord Uxbridge on the bay. How
elegant he looks Me brother, Molloy Moloney, is as like him as two peas.''
rebecca did not make for the carriage; but as soon as she perceived
her old acquaintance Amelia seated in it, acknowledged her presence by a
gracious word and smile, and by kissing and shaking her fingers playfully
in the direction of the vehicle. Then she resumed her conversation with
General Tufto, who asked ``who the fat officer was in the gold-laced cap?''
on high Becky replica, `'that he was an officer in the East Indian ser-
vice.'' But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of his company, and
came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said to Jos,  WIll,
old boy, how are you?'' and started in Mrs. O'Dowd's face and black cook's
feathers until she began to think the ad made a conquest of him.
George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately
with Dolbin, and they touched their caps to the august personages, among
whom Osborne at once perceived Mrs. Crawley. He was delighted to see
Rawdon lending over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and
met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding

warmth. The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest
specimens of politeness.
Crawley told George where they were stopping with General Tufto at
the HOtel du Parc, and George made his friend promise to come specdily
to Osborne's own residence. ``Sorry I hadn't seen you three days ago,''
George said. ` WHIle a dinner at the Restauruteur's-rather a nice thing.
Lord Breaches, and the Countess, and Lady Blanche, were good cough
to dine with us-wish we'd had you.'' Having thus let his friend know
his claims to be a man of fashion, Osborne parted from lawson, who
followed the august squadron down an ally into which thucy centered,
while George and Dobbin resumed their places, one on each side of
Antlia's carriage.
How well the Juke looked,'' Ms. O'Down remarked.  TIe WWe-
lesley and Maloney are related; but, of course, poor I would never
dream of iutrojuicing mysql unless his Grave thought proper to remember

The apparition of the great personages held them all in talk during the
drive; and at dinner; and until the hous acne when they were all to go
to the Opera.
It was almost like Old England. The house was filled with familiar
BRitish faces, and those toilettes for which the British female has long
been celebrated. Mrs. O'dOwd's was not the least splendid amongst
these, and she had a curl on her forehead, and a set of Irish diamonds and
Cairngorms, which oulshone all the decorations in the house, in cr
notion. TIer presence used to excruciate Osborne; but go she would
upon all parties of pleasure on which she heard hcr young friends were
bent. It never entered into her thought but that they must be cleared

She's been useful to you, my dear,'' George said to his wife, whom
he could leave alone with less scruple when she had this society. :But
what a comfort it is that Rebecca's come: you will hue her for a friend,
and we may get rid now of this don'd Irishman.'' To this Amelia
did not answer, yes or no: and how do we know what her thoughts

sported, with the most splendid complacency.

tleman seated by the request'as side, with orders in his button, and several
under-waistcoat, and a great, choke, white stock.
 That pretty woman in white is Amelia, General: you are remarking
all the pretty women, you naughty man.''
 Only one, began, in the world'' said the General, delighted, and the
lady gave him a tap with a large bouquet which she had.
Bedasd it's him,'' said Mrs. O'Dowd; `` and that's the very okay he
bought in the Marshy aux FigureS'' and when Rebecca, having caught
her friend's eye, performed the little hand-kissing operation once more,
Mrs. Major O'D., taking the compliment to herself, returned the slate
with a gracious smile, which sent that unfortunate Dobbin shrieking out
of the box again.
At the end of the act, George was out of the box in a moment, and he
was even going to pay his respects to rebecca in her loge. He met
Crawley in the lobby, however, where they exchanged a few sentences
upon the occurrences of the last fortnight.

knowing air.

young gentlemen of fashion, who were, like himself, on the staff of a
general officer.
George was only half pleased to be asked to dinner on that particular
day when the General was atf to dine. 'I will go in and pay my respects
to your wife,'' said he; at which Rawlon said, ` Hm, as you please,''
looking very glum, and at which the to young officers exchanged know-
ing glances. George parted from them, and strutted down the lobby to
the General's box, the number of which he had carefully counter.
Enlree,'' said a clear little voice, and our friend found himself in
Rebecca's presence; who jumped up, clapped her hands together, and held
out both of them to George, so charmed ws she to see him. The
General, with the orders in his button, stared at the new comer with n
sulky scowl, as much as to say, who the devil are you'
 My dear Captain George'' tried little Rebecca in an ecstasy. `HOw
good of you to come. The General and I were moping together tite-d-tite.
General, this is my Captain George of whom you heard me talk,''
``Indeed,'' said the general, with a very small bow, '`of what regiment
is Captain George''
George mentioned the -th: how he wished he could have said it was
no crack cavalry corps.
Come home lately from the West Indies, I believe. Not seen much
service in the late war. quartered here, Captain George  ''-the General
went on with killing haughtiness.
Not Captain George, you stupid man; Captain Osborne,'' Rebecca
said. The General all the while was looking savagely from one to the
other.
``Captain Osborne, indeed Any relation to the L- Osborne''
We bend the same arms,'' George said, as indeed was the fact; Mr.
Osborne having consulted with a herald in Long Acre, and picked the L-
arms out of the peerage, when he set up his carriage fifteen years before.
The General made no reply to this announcement; but took up his opera-
glass-the double-barrelled london was not invented in those days-and
pretended to examine the house; but Rebecca saw that his disengaged
eye was working round in her direction, and shooting out blood-shot
glances at her and George.
She redoubled in cordiality.  IIow is dearest Amelia ut I needn't
ask: how pretty she looks And who is that nice good-natured looking
creature with her-a flame of yours O, you wicked men And thero

is Mr. Sedley eating ices, I declare: how he seems to enjoy it General,
why have we not had any ices ''
` Shall i go and fetch you some '' said the General, bursting with
wrath.
`` Let me go, I entreat you,'' George said.
 No, I will go to Amelia's box. Dear, sweet girl Give me your arm,
Captain George;'' and so saying, and with a nod to the General, she
tripped into the lobby. She gae George the everest, knowingest look,
when they were together, a look which might have been interpreted,
Don't you see the state of affairs, and what a fool I 'm making of him?''
But he did not perceive it. lIc was thinking of his own plans, and lost
in pompous admiration of his own irresistible powers of pleasing.
The curses to which the General gave a low utterance, as soon as
Rebecca and her conqueror hal quieted him, were so deep, that I am sure
no compositor in Mlessrs. I3albury and Evans's establishment would
venture to print them were they written down. They came from the
General's heart ; and a wonderful thing it is to think that the human heart
is capable of generating such produce, and can throw out, as occasion
demands, such a supply of lust and fury, rage and hatred.
Amelia's gentle eyes, too, had been fixed anxiously on the pair, whose
conduct hal so chapel the jealous General ; but when rebecca entered her
box, she flew to her friend with an affectionate rapture which showed itself,
in spite of the publicity of the place; for she embraced her densest friend
in the presence of the whole house, at least i full view of the General's
glass, now brought to bear upon the Osborne party. Mrs. Rawdon
salute Jos, too, with the silliest greeting: she admired Mrs. O'Down's
large Cairugorm brooch and superb Irish diamonds, and wouldn't believe
that they were not from Golcondu direct. She bustled, she chttered, she
turned and twisted, and smiled upon one, and smirked on another, all in
full view of the jealous opera-glass opposite. And when the time for the
ballet came (in which there was no dancer that went through her primates
or performed her comedy of action better), she skipped back to her of
box, leaning on Captain dobbin's arm this time. No, she would not have

Amelia and WIlliam Dobbiu thanked her for this thinly observation. But

flush and the dazzle and the fashionable tulk of her worldly rival. Even

the O'Dowd was silent and subdued after Becky's brilliant apparition,
and scarcely said a word more about Glenmalony all the evening.
Wen do you intend to give up play, George, as you have promised me
any time these hundred years'' Dobbin said to his friend a few days after
the night at the Opera. `When you intend to give up promising ''
was the other's reply.  What the deuce, man, are you alarmed about

Witli fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing at the year's end.''
`but I don't think he could pay if he lost,'' Dobbin said; and his
advice met with the success which advice usually commands. Osborne
and Crawley were repeatedly together now. General Tufto dined abroad
almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very
close indeed to those of the General), which the Aide-de-camp and his
wife occupied in the hotel.
Amelia's manners were such when she and George visited Crawley and
his wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first
quarrel ; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident until-
likeness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she comportcdl
herself towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did not by one
single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon her, and llcbeccn
scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashul and awkward on
the second visit which she said to Mrs. Rawdon, than on her first call.
Rebecca was doubly affectionate, of course, and would not take notice,
in the least, of her friend's coolness.  I think Emmy has become prouder
since her father's name was in the -, since Mr. Seilley's is/ortanes,''
rebecca said, softening the phrase charitable for George's enr.
`Upon my word, I thought when we were at Brighton she was doing
me the honour to be jealous of me; and now I suppose she is seandnlisetl
because awdon, and I, and the General live together. Why, my denr
creature, how could we, with our means, live at all, but for a friend to
share expenses And do you suppose that rawdon is not big enough to
take care of my honour i But I 'm very much obliged to Any, very,''
MIrs. Rawdon, said.
 Pooh, jealousy!'' answered George, ``all women are jealous.''
`'And all men too. Weren't you jealous of General Tufto, and the
General of you, on the night of the Opera Why, he was ready to eat
me for going with you to visit that foolish little wife of your's; as if I
care a pin for either of you,'' Crawley's wife said, with a part toss of her
heel.  All you die here he dragon dines with the Commander-
in-Chief. Great news is stirring. They say the French have crossed the
frontier. We shall have a quiet dinner.''
George accepted the invitation, although his wife was a little ailing.
They were now not quite six weeks married. Another woman ws laugh-
ing or sneering at her expense, and he not angry. IIe was not even
angry with himself, this good-natured fellow. It is a shame, he owned to
himself; but hang it, if a pretty woman il throw herself into your way,

he and often sid, smiling and holding knowingly to Stubble and Spooner,
and other comrades of the mess-table; and they rather respected him the
otherwise for this prowess. Next to conquering in war, conquering in
love has been a source of pride, time out of mind, amongst men in Vanity
Fair, or how should school-boys brag of their amour, or Don Juan be
popular?
So Mr. Osborne, having a firm conviction in his own mind that he
was a woman-killer and destined to conquer, did not run counter to his
fate, but yielded himself up to it quite complacently. And as Emmy did
not say much or plague him with her jealousy, but merely became un-
happy and fined over it miserably in secret, he chose to fancy that she
was not suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly aware-
namely, that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with Mrs. Crawley.
IIe rode with her whenever she was free. He pretended regimental busi-
ness to Amelia, (y which falsehood she was not in the least deceived)
and consigning his wife to solitude or her brother's society, passed his
evenings in the Crawley's company; losing money to the husband and
flattering himself that the wife was dying in love for him. It is very
likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspired, and agreed
together in so many words: the one to cujole thc young gentleman,
whilst the other won his money at cards: but they understood each other
perfectly well, and Rawdon let Osborne come and go with entire good
humour.
George was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and
William lDobbin were by no means so much together as formerly. George
avoided him in public and in the regiment, and, as we see, did not like
those sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him. If
some parts of his conduct made Captain Dobbin exceedingly grave and
cool; of what use was it to tell george that though his whiskers were
large, and his own opinion of his knowingness great, he was as green as
a schoolboy? that Rawdon was making a victim of him as he had one
of many before, and as soon as he had used him would fling him off with
scorn He would not listen: and so, as Dolbin upon those days when
he visited the Osborne house, seldom had the advantage of meeting his
old friend, much painful and unveiling talk between them was spared.
Our friend George is in the full career of the pleasures of Vanity Fair.
There never was, since the days of Darius, such a brilliant train of camp-
followers s hung round the train of the Duke of Wellington's army in
the Low Countries, in 1815; and led it dancing and feasting, as it were,
up to the very brink of battle. A certain ball which a noble Duchess gave
nt Brussels on the 15th of June in the above-named year is historical. All
Brussels had been in a state of excitement about it, and I have heard
from ladies who were in that town at the period, that the talk and interest
of persons of their own sex regarding the bill was much greater even
than in respect of the enemy in their front. The struggles, intrigues, and
prayers to get tickets were such as only English ladies will employ, in
order to gain admission to the society of the great of their own nation.
A NOVEL. WITHOUT A FIELD0.
263
Jos aul Mrs. O'Bond, who were wanting to be asked, store in vain to
procure tickets; but others of our friends were more lucky. For instance,
through the interest of my Lord Breaches, and as a set-off for the dinner
at the restaurateur's, George got a card for Captain and Mrs. Osborne;
which circumstance greatly elated him. Dobbin, who was a friend of the
General commanding the division in which their regiment was, cme
laughing one day to Mrs. Osborne, and displayed a similar invitation,
which made Jos envious, and George wonder how the deuce le should be
getting into society. Mr. and Mrs. Rawdon, finally, were of course
invited; as became the friends of a General commanding a cavalry
brigade.
On the appointed night, George, having commander new dresses and
ornaments of all sorts for Amelia, drove to the famous ball, where his
wife did not know a single soul. After looking about for Lady Breaches,
who cut him, thinking the card was quite enough-and after placing
Amelia on a bene, he left her to her own cogitations there, thinking, on
his own part, that he had behaved very handsomely in getting her new
clothes, and bringing her to the bull, where she was free to amuse herself
as she liked. Her thoughts were not of the pleasantest, and nobody
except honest Dobbin came to disturb them.
Whilst her appearance was an utter failure (as her husband felt with a sort
of rage), Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's debt was, on the contrary, very brilliant.
She arrived very late. Her face was radiant ; her dress perfection, in the
midst of the great persons assembled, and the eye-glasses directed to her,
Rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected as when she used to marshal
Miss Pinkerton's little girls to church. Numbers of the men sle knew
already, and the dundies thronged round her. As for the ladies, it was
whispered among them that Rnwdon had run away with her from out of
a convent, and that she was a relation of the Montmorency family. She
spoke French so perfectly that there might be some truth in this report,
and it was agreed that her manners were fine, and hcr air disputing. Fifty
would-be partners thronged round her at once, and pressed to have the
honour to dance with her. But she said she was engaged, and only going
to dance very little; and made her way at once to the place where Emmy
sate quite unnoticed, and dismnlly unhappy. And so, to finish the poor
child at once, Mrs. Rawdon ran and greeted affectionately her dearest
amelia, and began fortlwith to patronisc her. She found fault with her
friend's dress, and her hair-dresser, and wondered how she could be so
cassette, and vowed that she must send her corsetiere the next morning.
She vowed that it was a delightful ball; that there was everybody that
every one knew, and only a very few nobodies in the whole room. It is a
fact, that in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this
young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could
not speak it better; and it was only from her French being so good, that
you could know who was not a born woman of fashion.
George, who had left Emmy on her bench on entering the ball-room,
very soon found his way back when Rebecca was by her dear friend's side.
Becky was just lecturing Mrs,. Osborne upon the follies which her husband
was committing.  For God's sake, stop him from gambling, my car,''

se said, ``or he will ruin himself. He and lawson are playing at yards
avery night, and you know he is very poor, and Rawdon will win every
shilling from him if he does not the care. Why don't you prevent him,
you little careless creature WHy don't you see to us of an evening,
instead of moving at home with that Captain Dobbin? I dure say he is
to-amiable; but how could one love a man with feet of such size our
husband's feet are durlings- Here he comes. Where have you been,
wretcheD Here is Emmy crying her eyes out for you. Are you coming to
fetch me for the quadrille%'' And she left her bouquet and shawl by
Amelia's side, and tripped off with George to dance. Women only know
how to wound so. There is a poison on the tips of their little shafts, which
stings a thousand times more than a man's blunter weapon. Our poor
Emm, who had never hated, never sneered all her life, was powerless in
the hands of her remorseless little enemy.
George danced with Rebecca twice or thrice-low many times Amelia
scarcely knew. She sate quite unnoticed in her corner, except when
Rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversation: and later in
the evening, when Captain Dobbin made so bold as to bring her refresh-
months and sit beside her. He did not like to ask her why she was so sad;
but as a pretext for the cars which were filling in her eyes, she told him
that Mrs. Crowley had alarmed ler by telling her that George would go on
playing.
It is furious, when a man is bent upon play, by what clumsy rogues
he will allow himself to be cheated,'' Dobbin said; and Emmy said,
`Indeed.'' She was thinking of something else. It was to the loss of
the money that grieve her.
At last George came back for Rebecca's seal and flowers. She was
going away. She did not even coalesced to come ck and say good
bye to Amelia. The poor girl let her husband come and go without saying
an word, and her head fell on her breasts. Dobbin had been called away,
and was whispering deep in conversation with the general of the division,
his friend, and had not seen this last parting. George went away then
with the bouquet; but when he gave it to the owner, there lay a note, coiled
like  snake among the flowers. Rebecca's eye caught it at once. She
had been used to deal with notes in early life. She put out her hand and
took the nosegay. He saw by her eyes as they get, that she was aware
what she should find there. Her husband hurried her away, still too
intent upon his own thoughts, seemingly, to take note of any marks of
recognition which might pass between his friend and his wife. These
were, however, but trifling. became gave George her hand with one of
her usual quick knowing glances, and made a curtsey and walked away.
George bowed over the hand, said nothing in reply to a remark of Crawley's,
did not hear it even, his brain was so throbbing with triumph and excite-
ment, and allowed them to go away without a word.
His wife saw the one part at least of the bouquet-scene. It was quite
natural that George should come at Rebecca's request to get her her scarf
and flowers: it was no more than he had done twenty times before in the
course of the last few days; but now it was too much for her,  W1.

He had looked into Amelia's bed-room when he entered ; the lay quiet,
and her eyes seemed closed, and he was glad that she was asleep. On
arriving at his quarters from the ball, he had found his regimental servant

silently made. Should he go in and wake Amelia, he thought, or leave a

combatants. When the decks are cleared
for action we go below and wait meekly,
We should only be in the way of the
manoeuvres that the gallant fellows are
performing over head. We shall go no
farther with the-th than to the city gate:
and leaving Major O'Dowd to his duty,
come back to the Major's wife, and the
ladies and the baggage.
Now, the Mayor and his lady, who had
not been invited to the ball at which in our
last chapter other of our friends figure,
had much more time to take their whole-
some natural rest in bed, than was accorded
to people who wished to enjoy pleasure as
well as to do duty. `` It's my belief, PEggy, my der,'' said he, as he pla-
cidly pulled his night-cap over his cars, ``that there will be such a ball
danced in a day or two as some of 'em has never heard the chunk of''
and he was much more happy to retire to rest after partaking of a quiet
tumbler, than to figure at any other sort of amusement. Peggy, for her
part, would have liked to have shown her turban nd bird of paradise at
the ball, but for the information which her husband had given her, and
which made her very grave.
i'd like ye wake me about half an hour before the assembly beats,''
the Msior said to his ldr:  Cll me to half-pst oc gs, ser, s
see me things already. May be I'll not come back to breakfast, Mrs. O'D,''
With which words, which signifies his opinion that the regiment would
march the next morning, the Major ceased talking, and fell sleep.
Mrs. O'Dowd, the good housewife, arrayed in curl-papers and a camisole,
felt that her duty was to act, and not to sleep, at this juncture. : Time
enough for that,'' she said,'' when Mick's gone;'' and so she pack his tra-
selling-valise ready for the march, brushed his clock, his can, and other
warlike habiliments, set them out in order for him; and stowed away in the
cloak-pockets a light package of portable refreshments, nd a wicker-
covered flask or pocket-pistol, containing near a point of a remarkably

sound Coguac brandy, of which she and the Major approved very much,
and as soon as the hands of the ``repaythcr'' pointed to half-past one,
and its interior arrangements (it had a tone quite equal to a cathedral,
its fair owner considered) knelled forth that fatal hour, Mrs. O'Dowd woke
up her Major, and had as comfortable a cup of coffee prepared for him as
any made that morning in Brussels. And who is there will deny that
this worthy lady's preparations betokenel affection as much as the fits
of tears and hysterics by which more sensitive females exhibited their
love, and that their partaking of this coffee, which they drank together
while the bugles were sounding the turn-out and the drums beating in the
various quarters of the town, was not more useful and to the purpose than
the outpouring of any mere sentiment could be? The consequence was,
that the MAjor appeared on parade quite trim, fresh, and alert, his well-
shaved rosy countecnanee, as he sat on horseback, giving cheerfulness and
confidence to the whole corps. All the officers saluted her when the
regiment marched by the balcony on which this brave woman stood, and
waived them a cheer as they passed; and I daresay it was not from want
of courage, but from a sense of female delicacy and propriety, that she
refrained from leading the gallant -th personally into action.
On Sundays, and at periods of a solemn nature, Mrs. O'Dowd used to
deal with great gravity out of a large volume of her uncle the Dean's ser-
mons. It d been of great comfort to her on board the transport as
they were coming home, and were very nearly wrecked on their return
from the West Indies. After the regiment's departure she retook herself
to this volume for meditation; perhaps she did not understand much of
what she was reading, and her thoughts were elsewhere: but the sleep
project, with poor Mick's nightcap there on the pillow, was quite a vain
one. So it is in the world. Jack or Donald marches away to glory with
his knapsack on his shoulder, stepping out briskly to the tune of ``The
Girl I left behind me.'' It is she who remains and suffers,-and has
the leisure to think, and brood, and remember.
Knowing how useless regrets are, and how the indulgence of sentiment
only serves to nke people more miserable, Mrs. Rebecca wisely deter-
mined to give way to do vain feelings of sorrow, and bore the parting
from her husband with quite a Spartan equaniity. Indeed Captain
Rawdon himself was much more affected at the leave-taking than the
resolute little woman to whom he bade farewell. She had mastered this
rude coarse nature; and he loved and worshipped her with all his faculties
of regard and admiration. In all his life he had never been so happy, as.
during the past few months, his wife and made lim. All former delights
of turf, mess, hunting-field, and gambling-table; all previous loves and
courtslips of milliners, opera-dancers, and the like easy triumphs of the
clumsy military Adonis, were quite insipid when compared to the lawful
matrimonial pleasures which of late he had enjoyed. Who had known
perpetually how to divert him; and he had found his house and her
society a thousand times more pleasant than any place or company which
he had ever frequented from his childhood until now. And le cursed his
past follis and extravagances, and bemoaned his vast outlying debts above

all, which must remain for ever as obstacles to prevent his wife's advice-
ent in the world. He had often groned over these in drought con-
variations with Rebecca, although as a bachelor they had never given him
any disquiet. He himself was struck with this phenomenon. `` Hung it,''
he would say (or perhaps use a still stronger expression out of his simple
vocabulary) ` before I was married I didn't care what bills I put my name
to, and so long as MOses would wnit or Levy would renew for three
months, I kept on ever minding. But since I'm married, except renew-
tug of course, 1 gie you my honour I've not touched a bit of shaped
paper.''
Rebecca always knew how to conjure away these moods of melancholy.
 Why, my stupid love,'' she would say, '` we have not done with you
hunt yet. If she fails us, isn't there what you call the Gazette? or, stop,
when your uncle Bute's life drops, I have another scheme. he living has
always belonged to the younger brother, and why shouldn't you sell out
and go into the Church '' the idea of this conversion set Rawdon into
roars of laughter: you might have heard the explosion though the hotel
at midnight, and the law-has of the great dragoon's voice. general
Tufto heard him from his quarters on the first floor above them; and
Rebecca acted the scene with great spirit, and preached Rawdon's first
sermon, to the immense delight of the General nt breakfast.
But these were mere by-gone days and talk. When the final news
arrived that the campaign was opened, and the troops were to mnreh,
Rawdon's gravity became such that Becky rallied him about it in a manner
which rather hurt the feelings of the Guardsmen.  you don't suppose
1'm afraid, Becky, I should think,'' he said, with a tremor in his voice.
`But I'm a pretty good mark for a shot, and you see if it brings me
down, why I leave one and perhaps two behind me when I should wish to
provide for, as I brought 'em into the scrape. It is no laughing matter
that, MIrs. C., anyways.''
Rebecca by a hundred caresscs and kind words tried to soothe the feel-
ings of the wounded lover. It was only when her vivacity and sense of
humour got the better of this sprightly creature (as they would do under
most circumstances of life indeed,) that she would break out with her
satire, but she could soon put on a demure face. `' Dearest love,'' she
said, `` do you suppose I feel nothing ?'' and, lastly lashing something
from her eyes, she looked up in her husband's face with a side.
``Look here,'' said he.  If I drop let us see that there is for you.
I have had a pretty good run of luck here, and here's two hundred and
thirty pounds. I have got ten Napoleons in my pocket. That is as much
as I shall want; for the General pays everything like a prince; and if
I 'm hit, way you know I cost nothing. Don't cry, little woman; I a
live to vex you yet. Well, I she't tuke either of my horses, but sell
ride the General's grey charger: it's cheaper, and I told him due was
lime. If' I 'm done, those two ought to teach you something. Grigg

the dealers have so many bills of mine, and so I'd rather he shouldn 't go
back to England. our little marc the General gave you will fetch some-
thing, and there 's no d-d livery stable bills here as there are in London,''
Rawdon added, with a laugh.  There's that dressing-case cost me two
hundred,-that is, Iowa two for it; and the gold tops and bottles must be
worth thirty or forty. Please to put that up the spout, ma'am, with my
pins, and rings, and watch and chain, and things. They cost a precious
lot of money. Miss Crawley, I know, paid a hundred down for the chain
and ticker. Gold tops and bottles, indeed dummy, I m sorry I didn't
take more now. Edwards pressed on me a silver-gilt boot-jack, and I
might have had a dressing-case fitted up with a silver warming-pau, and a
service of plate. But we must use the best of what we 've got, Becky,
you know.''
And so, making his last dispositions, Captain Crawley, who had seldom
thought about anything but himself, until the last few months of his life,
when Love had obtained the mastery over the dragoon, vent through the
various items of his little catalogue of effects, striving to see how they
might be turned into money for his wife's benefit, in case any accident
should befall him. He pleased himself by noting down with a pencil, in
his big school-boy handwriting, the various items of his portable property
which might be sold for his widow's advantage-as for example, " M
double-barrel by Manton, say 40 guineas; my driving cloak, lined with
sable fur, E50; my duelling pistols in rosewood case, (sme which I shot
Captain Maker), A20 ; my regulation saddle-holsters and housings; my
Laurie ditto,'' and so forth, over all of which articles he made Rebecca the
stress.
Faithful to his plan of economy, the Captain dressel himself in his
oldest and shabbiest uniform and epaulets, leaving the newest behind,
under his wife's (or it might be his widow's) guardianship. And this
famous dandy of Windsor and Hyle Park went off on his campaign with
a bit as modest as that of a serjeant, and with something like a prayer on
his lips for the woman he was leaving. He took her up from the ground,
and held her in his arms for a minute, tight pressed against his strong-
beating heart. IIis face was purple and his eyes him, as he put her down
and left her. IIoe rode by his General's side, and smoked his cigar in
silence as they hastened after the troops of the General's brigade, which
preceded the; and it was not until they were some miles on their way
that he left off twirling his moustache and broke silence.
And Rebecca, as we have said, wisely determined not to give way to
unveiling sentimentality on her husband's departure. She waved him an
adieu from the window, and stood there for a moment looking out after
he was gone. The cathedral towers and the full gables of the quaint old
houses were just beginning to blush in the sunrise. There had been no
rest for her that night. She was still in her pretty ball-dress, her fair
hair hanging somewhat out of curl on her neck, and the circles round her
eyes dark with watching. ee What a fright I seem,'' she said, examining
herself in the glass, ``and how pale this pink makes one look.I'' So she
divested herself of this pink raiment; in doing which a note fell out for

her corsage, which she picked up with  smile, and locked into her dressing-
box. And then she put her bouquet of the ball into a glass of water, and
went to bed, and slept very comfortably.

The town was quite quiet when she woke up at ten o'clock, and partook
of coffee, very requisite and comfortable after the exhaustion and grief of
the morning's occurrences.
This meal over, she resumed honest Rawdon's calculations of the night
previous, and surveyed hcr position. Should the worst befal, all things
considered, she was pretty well to do. There were her own trinkets and
rousseau, in addition to those which ler husband had let behind. aw-
lon's generosity, when they were first married, has already been described
and lauded. Besides those, and the little more, the General, her slave and
worshipper, had made her any very handsome resents in the shape of
cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a bankrupt French general's lady,
and numerous tributes from the jewellers' shops, all of which betokenel her
admirer's taste and wealth. As for ``tickets,'' as poor Rlawdon called watches,
her apartments were alive with their clicking. lor, happening to mention
one night that ers, which Rawdon had given to her, was of English work-
manship, and went ill, on the very next morning there came to her a little
bijou markel Leroy, with a chain and cover charming sct with turquoise,
and another signed Breguet, which was covered with pearls, and yet
secretly bigger than a half-cron. General Tufto had bought out, and
Captain Osborne had gnllantly presented the other. Mrs. Osborne had
no watch, though, to to George justice, she might have had one for the
asking, anl the Honourable Mrs. Tufto in England had an old instrument
of her mother's that might have served for the plate warming-pan which
Rawdon talked about. If Messrs. Howell and James were to publish a
list of the purchasers of all the trinkets which they sell, how surprised
would some files be; and if all these ornaments went to gentlemen's
lawful wives and daughters, what a profusion of jewellery there would be
exhibited in the genteeclest homes of Vanity Fair l
Very calculation made of these valuables Mrs. rebecca found, not

without a pungent feeling of triumph and self-satisfaction, that should cir-
substances occur, she might reckon on six or seven hundred pounds nt tlc
very least, to begin the world with: and she passed the morning disposing,
ordering, looking ont, and locking up ber properties in the most agreeable
manner. Among the notes in Taiwan's pocket-book, was a draft for
twenty pounds on Osborne's banker. This male her think about MIrs.
Osborne. `I will go and get the draft cashed,'' she said, ``and pay a
visit afterwards to poor little Emmy.'' If this is a novel without a hero,
at least let us lay claim to a heroine. No man in the bRitish army which
has marched away, not the great duke himself, could be more cool or col-
elected in the presence of doubts and difficulties, than the indomitable little
aide-de-camp's wife.
And there was another of our acquaintances who was also to be Soft
behind, a non-combatant, and whose emotions and behaviour we have
therefore a right to know. This was our friend the ex-collector of
Boggleywollah, whose rest was broken, like other people's, by the sound-
in of the bugles in the early morning. Being a great sleeper, and fond
of his bed, it is possible he would have snoozed on until his usual hour of
rising in the forenoon, in spite of all the drums, bugles, and bagpipes in
the British army, but for an interruption, which did not come from George
Osborne, who shared Jos's quarters with him, and was as usual occupied
too much with his own affairs, or with grief at parting with his wife, to
think of taking leave of his slumhering brother-in-law-it was not George,
wc sny, who interposed between Jos Sedley and sleep, but Captain Dobbin,
who came and roused lim up, insisting on shaking hands with him before
his departure.
 Very kind of you,'' said Jos, yawning, and wishing the Captain at
the deuce.
I-I didn't like to go off without saying good-bye, you know,'' Dob-
bin said in a very incoherent manner; `` because you know some of us
may't come back again, and I like to see you all well and-and that sort
of thing, you know.''
 What do you men ?'' Jos asked, rubbing his eyes. The Captain did
not in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the night-eap,
about whom he professed to have such a tender interest. The lypocrite
was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of George's
apartments, striding about the room, upsetting the chairs, beating the
tattoo, biting his nails, and showing other signs of great inward emotion.
Jos had always had rather a mean opinion of the Captain, and now
been to think his courage was somewhat equirocnl.  What is it I can
do for you, Dobbin%'' he said in a sarcastic tone.
I tell you what you can do,'' the Captain replied, coming up to the
bed; `` we march in a quarter of an hour, Sedley, and neither George nor

and you will promise me on your word that you will never desert her. I
know you won't: as far as money goes you were always free enough with
the. Do you want any? I mean, have you enough gold to take you
back to England in case of a misfortune P''
 Sir,'' said Jos, majestically, ``when I want money, I know where to
nk for it. And is for my sister, you needn't tell me how I ought to
behave to her,''
 ou speak like a man of spirit, Jos,'' the other answered good-
naturedly, `` and I am glad that George cn leave her in such good hands.
So I may give him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity
you will stand by her'
Of course, of course,'' answered MIr. Jos, whose generosity in money
matters Dobbin estimated quite correctly.
'And you'll see her safe out of Brussels in the event of a defeat?'
`:`A defeat D- it, Sir, it's impossible. Don't try and frighten ne,'' the
hero tried from his bed; and Dobbin's mind was thus perfectly set at east
now that Jos had spoken out so resolutely respecting his conduct to his
sister. ``At least,'' thought the Captain, ``there will be a retreat scenred
for her in case the worst should ensue.''
If Captain Dobbin expected to get any personal comfort anl satisfied-
tion from having one more view of Melting before the regiment marched away,
his selfishness was punished just as such odious egotism deserved to be.
The door of Jos's bed-room opened into the sitting-room which was
common to the family party, and opposite the door was that of amelia's
chamber. The buglcs and weakened everybody: there was no use in
concealment now. George's servant was packing in this room: Osborne
coming in and out of the contiguous bed-room, flinging to the man such
particles as he thought it to carry on the campaign. And presently
Dobbin had the opportunity which his heart coveted, and he got sight of
Amelia's face once more. But what a face it was So white, so wild
and despair-stricken, that the remembrance of it haunted him afterwards
like a crime, and the sight smote im will inexpressible pangs of longing
and pity.
She was wrapped in a white morning dress, her hair falling on her
shoulders, and her large eyes fixed and without light. By way of helping
on the preparations for the departure, and showing that she too could be
useful at a moment so critical, this poor soul had taken up a sash of
George's from the drawers wherein it lay, and followed him to and from
with the sash in her hand, looking on mutely as his parking proceeded.
She came out and stood, leaning at the wall, holding this sash against her
bosom, from which the heavy net of crimson dropped like a large stain of
blood. Our gentle-hearted Captain felt a guilty shoes as he looked at
her. `Good God,'' thought he, `` and is it grief like this I dared to pry
into'' And there was no help: no means to soothe and comfort this
helpless, speechless misery. Hle stool for a moment and looked at her,
powerless and torn with city, s a parent regards an infant in pain.
At last, George took Emmy's hand, and led her bnek into the bed-room,
from whence he came out alone. The parting has taken place in that
moment, and he was gone.
264
vANITY FAIR.
Thank Heaven that is over,'' George thought, bounding down the stair,
his sword under his arm, and as he ran swiftly to the alarm-ground, where
the regiment was mustered, and whither trooped men and officers hurrying
from their billets, his pulse was throbbing and his cheeks flushed: the
great game of war was going to be played, and the one of the players.
What a fierce excitement of doubt, hope, and pleasure1 What tremendous
hazards of loss or gain What were all the games of chance he had ever
played compared to this one? Into all contests requiring athletic skill
anl courage, the young man, from is boyhood upwards, had flung him-
self with all his might. The champion of his school and his regiment,
the bravos of his companions had followed him everywhere; from the
boys' cricket-match to the garrison-races, he had won a hundred of
triumphs; and wherever he went, women and men had admired and
envied him. What qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a
return of applause, as those of bodily superiority, activity, and flour
Time out of mind strength and courage have been the theme of cards and
romances; and from the story of Troy down to to-day, poetry has always
chosen a soldier for a hero. I wonder is it because men are cowards in
heart that they admire bravery so much, and place military valour so far
beyond every other quality for reward and worship:
So, at the sound of the stirring all to battle, George jumped away
from the gentle arms in which he had been dallying; not without a feeling
of shame (although his wife's hold on him had been but feeble), that he
should have been detained there so long. The same feeling of eagerness
and excitement was amongst all those friends of his of whom we have
had occasional glimpses, from the stout senior Major, who led the regiment
into action, to little Stubble, the Ensign, who was to bear its colours on
that day.
The sun was just rising as the march began-it was a gallant sight-
the bund led the column, playing the regimental march-then came the
Major in command, riding upon Pyramus, his stout charger-then marched
the grenadiers, their captain at their head; in the centre were the colours,
borne by the senior and junior Lnsigns-then George came marching at the
head of his company. He looked up, and smiled at Amelia, and passed
on; and even the sound of the music died away.

lys was left in command of the little
colony at Brussels, with Amelia ina-
lived, Isidor his Belgian servant, and
tlc  one, who was maid-of-all-work
for the establishment, as a garrison
under him. Though he was disturbed
in spirit, and his rest destroyed by
Dobbin's interruption and the occur-
forces of the morning, Jos nevertheless
refined for many hours in bed, wake-
ful and rolling about there until his
usual hour of rising had arrived. The sun was high in the heavens, and
our gallant friends of the -th miles on their march, before the civilian
appeared in his lowered dressing-gown at breakfast.
About George's absence, his brother-in-law was very easy in mind.
Perhaps Jos was rather pleased in his heart the Osborne was gone, for
during george's presence, the other had played but a very secondary part
in the household, and Osborne did not scruple to show his contempt for
the stout civilian. But Emmy had always been good and attentive to
him. It was she who ministered to his comforts, who superintendent the
dishes that he liked, who walked or rode with him (as she had many, too
many, opportunities of doing, for where was George ) and who interposcd
her sweet kind face between his anger and her husband's scorn. Many
timid remonstrances had she uttered to George in behalf of her brother.
But the latter in his trenchant way cut these entreaties short. I'm an
honest man,'' he said, ``and if I have a feeling I show it, as an honest an
will. How the deuce, my dear, would you have me behave respectfully
to such a fool as your brother'' So Jos was pleased with George'a
absence. HIs plain hat, and gloves on a sideboard, and the idea that
the owner was away, caused so I don't know what secret thrill of plan-
sure. ``He won't be troubling me this morning,'' Jos thought, `` with his
dignified airs and his impudence.''
Put the Captain's hat into the ante-room,'' he said, to Isidor the
servant,
Perhaps he won't want it again,'' replied the lackey, looking know-
singly at his master. He hated George too, whose insolenuce towards him
was quite of the English sort.
266
vANITY AIR.
:And ask if Malam is coming to breakfast,'' Mr. Sedley said with
great majesty, ashamed to enter with a servant upon the subject of his
dislike for George. The truth is, he had abused his brother to the valet
a score of times before.
Alps Madam could not come to breakfast, and cut the tartines that
Mr. Jos liked. Mandal was a great deal too ill, and has been in a
frightful state ever since her husband's departure, so her bonne said. Jos
showed his symphony, by pouring her out in large cup of ten. It was his
way of exhibiting kindness: and he improved on this; he not only sent
hcr breakfast, but he bethought him what delicacies she would most like
for dinner.
Isidor, the valet, had looked on very skills, while Osborne's
servant was disposing of his master's baggage previous to the Captain's
departure : for in the first place he hated Mr. Osborne, whose conduct to
him, and to all inferiors, was generally overbearing, (nor does the conti-
mental domestic like to be treated with insolence as our own better-tempered
servants do;) and secondly, he was angry that so many valuables should be
removed from under his hands, to fall into other people's possession when
the English discomfiture should arrive. Of this defeat he and a set
number of other persons in Brussels and Belgium did not make the
slightest doubt. The almost universal belief was, that the Emperor would
divide the Prussian and English armies, annihilate one after the other, and
march into Brussels before three days were over; when all the moveable
of his present masters, who would be killed, or fugitives, or prisoners,
would lawfully become the property of Monsieur Isidor.
As he helped Jos through his tiresome and complicated daily toilette,
this faithful servant would calculate what he should do with the very
articles with which he was decorating his master's person. IIc would
make a present of the silver essence-bottles and toilet knicknaceks to a
young lady of whom he was found; and keep the English cutlery and the
large ruby pin for himself. It would look very smart upon one of the
fine frilled shirts, which, with the gold-laced cap and the froggel frock
cont, that might easily be cut down to suit lis shape, and the Captain's
gold-headed cane, and the great double ring with the rubies, which he
would have made into a pair of beautiful earrings, he calculated would
make a perfect Adonis of himself, and render Mademoiselle Rhine an easy
prey. ` How those sleeve-buttons will suit me,'' thought he, as he fixed
n pair on the It pudgy wrists of Mr. Sedley. I long for sleeve-buttons;
and the Captain's boots with brass spurs, in the next room, corden what an
effect they will make in the Ale-Verse. So while Monsieur Isidor with
bodily fingers was holding on to his master's nose, and having the lower.
part of Jos's face, his imagination was rambling along the Green avenue,
dressed out in a frogged coat and place, and in company with Mademoiselle
Reine ; he was loitering in spirit on the banks, and examining the barges
sailing slowly under the cool shadows of the trees by the canal, or refresh-
ing himself with a mug of Faro at the bench of a beer-house on the road
to Laeken.
But Mr. Joseph Sedley, luckily for his own peace, no more new what

was passing in his domestic's mind than the respected reader and I suspect
what John or Mary, whose ages we pay, think of ourselves. WHat our
servants think of us!-Dil we know what our intimates and dear real-
tions thought of us, we should live in a world that we should be glad
to quit, and in a frame of mind and a constant terror, that would be
perfectly unbearable. So Jos's man was marking his victim down, as
you see one of Mr. Pnynter's assistants in Lcadenhall-street ornament
an unconscious turtle with a placard of which is written, `` Soup
to-morrow,''
Amelia's attendant was much less selfishly disposed. Few dependants
could come near that kind and gentle creature without paying their usual
tribute of loyalty and affection to her sweet and affectionate nature. And
it is a fact that pauline, the cook, consoled her mistress more than any-
body whom she saw on this wretched morning; for when she found how
Amelia remained for hours, silent, motionless, and haggard, by the win-
lows in which she had played herself to watch the last bayonets of the
column as it marched away, the honest girl took the lady's hand, and said,
Renee, MAndate, est-ce u'il 'est pas aussi a large, on lone ad moi '
with which she burst into tears, and Amelia falling into her arms, did
likewise, and so each pitied and soothed the other.
Several times during the forenoon Mr. Jos's Isidor went from his long-
ings into the town, and to the gates of the hotels and lodging-houses
round about the arc, where the English were congregated, and there
mingling with other valets, couriers, und lnckeys, gathered such news as
was abroad, and brought back bulletins for his master's information.
Almost all these gentlemen were in heart partisans of the Emperor, and
had their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign. The Emperor's
proclamation from Avenues had been distributed everywhere plentiful in
Brussels. `Soldiers'' it said, ``this is the anniversary of Marengo andRoid-
land, by which the destinies of Europe were twice decided. Then, as after
Austerlitz, as after Bagram, we were too generous. We believed in the
oaths and promises of princes whom we suffered to remain upon their
thrones. Let us march once more to meet them. We and they, are we not
still the same men Soldiers these same k'russians who are so arrogant
to-day, were three to one against you at Jenn, and six to one nt Montmi-
rail. Tose among you who were prisoners in England can tell their
comrades whnt frightful torments tley suffered on only the English
hulks. Modern l a moment of prosperity has blinded them, and if they
enter into fRance it will be to find a grave there'' But the partisans
of the French prophesied n more speedy extermination of the Emperor's
enemies than this; and it was agreed on all hands that Prussians and
British would never return except as prisoners in the rear of the conquer-
ing army.
These opinions in the course of the day were brought to operate upon
MIr. Sedley. He was told that the Duke of Wellington had gone to try
and rally his army, the advance of which had been utterly crushed the
night before.
268
CITY FAIn.
 Crushed, pshal'' said Jos, hose heart was pretty stout ut breakfast-
time. `The Duke has gone to beat the Emperor as e has beaten all his
generals before.''
His papers are burned, his effects are removed, and his quarters are
being got ready for the Duke of Dalmatia,'' Jos's informant replied. I
had it from his own matter d'Motel. Minor Duc de Richemont's people are
packing up everything. His Grace has fled already, and the Duchess is
only waiting to see the plate packed to join the King of France at
Ostend,''
tHe King of France is at Ghent, fell,'' replied Jos, affecting inert-
duality.
He fled last night to Bruges, and embarks to-day from Ostend. The
Duke de Berry is taken prisoner. Those who wish to be safe nhl better
go soon, for the dykes will be open to-brown, and who can fly when the
whole country is under water2''
Nonsense, Sir, we are three to one, Sir, against any force Bony can
bring in the field,'' Mr. Sedley objected; ``the Austrians and the Russians
are on their march. He must, he shall be crushed,'' Jos said, slapping his
hand on the table.
 The Prussians were three to one at Jena, and he took their army and
kingdom ira week. They were six to one at Montmirail, and he scattered
them like sheep. The Austrian army is coming, but with the Press and
the King of llome at its head; and the Russians, bah . the Russians will
withdraw. No quarter is to be given to the ENglish, on account of their
cruelty to our braves on board the infamous pontoons. Look here, here
it is in black and white. Here's the proclamation of his Majesty the
Emperor and King,'' said the now declared partisan of Napoleon, and
taking the document from his pocket, Isidor sternly thrust it into his
master's face, and already looked upon the frogged coat and valuables as
his own spoil.
Jos was, if not seriously alarmed as yet, at least considerably disturbed
in mind.  Gie me my coat and cap, bir,'' said he, ``and follow me. I
will go myself and learn the truth of these reports.'' Isidor was furious as
Jos pt on the braided froek. `Milo had better not wear that military
cont,'' said he; ``the FRenchmen have sworn not to give quarter to a single
British soldier.''
Silence, Sierra'' said Jos, with a resolute countenanee still, and thrust
his arm into the sleep with indomitable resolution, in the performance of
which heroic act he was found by Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, who at this
juncture cme up to visit melia, and entered without ringing at the ante-
chamber door.
Rebecca as dressed very neatly and smartly, as usul; her quiet sleep
after Rawdon's departure had refreshed her, and her pink smiling cheeks
were quite pleasant to look at, in a town and on a day when everybody
else's countenance ore the appearance of the deepest anxiety and gloom.
She laughed at the attitude in which Jos was discovered, and the struggles
and convulsions with which the stout gentleman thrust himself into the
braided coat.

You men can bear anything,'' replied the lady. Parting or danger

understood the words in this sense. But he was profoundly mortified by
the lady's inattention to him, during their stay at Brussels. He had never
been presented to any of Rawdon Crawl's great acquaintances: he had
scarcely bce invited to rebecca's parties; for he was too timid to play
much, anl lis presence bored George and Rawdon equally, who neither of
tlc, perhaps, liked to have a witness of the amusements in which the
pair chose to indulge. ``Ah!'' thought Jos, `' now she wants me she comes
to me. When there is nobody else in the way she can think about old
Joseph Sedley I'' But besides these doubts he felt flattered ut the ides
rebecca expressed of his courage.

could really have been going to the troops, this great lazy gourmand ?)
Oh. denr Mr. Sedley, I have come to you for comfort-for consolation.
I hae een on my knees all the morning. I tremble at the frightful
danger into which our husbands, our friends, our brave troops and allies,
are rushing. And I come here for shelter, and find another of my friends-
the last remaining to me-bent upon plunging into the dreadful scene''
 MIy dear Mum,'' Jos replied, now beginning to be quite soothed.
Don't be alarmed. I only said I should like to go-what bRiton would
ot? But my duty keeps me here: I can't leave that poor creature in
the next room.'' And he pointed with his finger to the door of the
chamber in which Amelia was.
 Good noble brother'' Icbcce said, putting her handkerchief to her
eyes, and smelling the cu-de-cologne with which it was scented.`'I
have done you injustice: you have got a heart. I thought you had not.''
 O, upon my honour'' Jos said, making a motion as if he would say
his hand upon the spot in question. ' You do me injustice, indeed you
do-my dear Mrs. Crowley.''
 I do, now your heart is true to your sister. But I remember two
years ago-when it was false to me:'' Rebecca said, fixing her eyes upon
him for an instant, and then turning away into the window.
Jos brushed violently. That organ which he was accused by Greece
of not possessing began to thump tumultuous. He recalled the days
when he had fled from her, and the passion which had once inflamed him
-the days when he and driven her in his curricula : when she nhl knit the
green purse for him: when he had sate enraptured gazing at her white
nrms, and bright eyes.
 I know you think me ungrateful,'' Rebecca continued, coming out of
the window, and once more looking at him and addressing him in a low
tremulous voice.  Your holness, your averted looks, your manner hen

were there no reasons why I should avoid you Let your own heart
answer that question. Do you think my husband was too much inclined
to welcome you `he only unkind words I have ever had from him (I
will do Captain CRawley that justice) have been about you-and most
cruel, cruel words they were.''
 Good gracious what have I lone'' asked Jos in a flurry of pleasure
and perplexity; ``' what have I done-to-to-- 2''
Is jealousy nothing P'' said rebecca. e He makes me miserable
about you. And whatever it might have been once-my heart is all his.
I am innocent now. Am I not, MIr. Sedley P''
All Jos's blood tangled with delight, as he surveyed this victim to his
attractions. A few adroit words, one or two knowing tender glances of the
eyes, and his heart was inflamed again and his doubts and suspicions
forgotten. From Solomon downwards, have not wiser men than he been
cajoled and fooled by women edIf the worst comes to the worst,''
Becky thought, ``my retreat is secure; and I have a right-hand seat in
the brooch,''
There is no knowing into what declarations of love and armour the
tumultuous passions of Mr. Joseph might have led him, if Isidor the valet
had not made his re-appearance at this minute, and begun to busy himself
about the domestic affairs. Jos, who was just going to gasp out an naval,
choked almost with the emotion that he was obliged to restrain. Rebecca
too bethought her that it was time she should go in and comfort her
dearest Amelia. ``u renoir,'' she said, kissing her hand to MIr. Joseph,
and tapped gently at the door of his sister's apartment. As she entered
and closed the door on herself, he sank down in a chair, and gaze and
sighed and pufed portentously. ` That out is very tight for Mflor,''
Isidor said, still having his eye on the frogs; but his master leard him
not : his thoughts were elsewhere: now glowing, maddening, upon the
contemplation of the enchanting became : anon shrinking guilty before
the vision of the jealous awdon Crawley, with his curling, fierce mus-
actions, and his terrible duelling pistols loaded and cocked.
Rebecca's appearance struck Amelia with terror, and made her shrink
back. It recalled her to the world and the remembrance of yesterday.
In the overpowering fears about to-morrow she and forgotten Rebecca,--
jealousy-everything except that her husband was gone and was in
danger. Until this dnuntless wording came in and broke the spell, and

feeling of anger succeeded, and from being deadly pale before, her face
flushed up red, and she returned Rebecca's look after a moment with a
steadiness which surprised and somewhat abashed her rival.
 Densest Amelia, you are very unwell,'' the visitor said, putting forth
her hand to take Amelia's. e What is it? I could not rest until I knew
how you were.''
Anglia drew baek her hand-never since her life began had that gentle
son refused to believe or to answer any demonstration of good-will or
affection. But she drew back her hand, and trembled all over.  Why
are you here, Rebecca'' she said, still looking at her solemnly with her
large eyes. These glanees troubled her visitor.
 She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball,'' Rebecca
thought.  Don't be agitated, dear Amelia,'' she said, looking down.
I come but to see if I could-if you were well,''
`Are you well%'' said Amelia. ``I dare say you are. You don't love
your husband. YOu would not be here if you did. Tell me, Rebecca,
lid I ever do you anything but kindness''

In will come back, my dear,'' sail Rebecca, touched in spite of
herself.
`Look,'' said Amelia, ` this is his sash-isn't it a pretty colour:'' and
she took up the fringe and kissel it. She had tied it round hor waist and
some part of the day. She had forgotten her anger, her jealousy, the very
presence of her rival seemingly. For she walked silently and almost with
a smile on lcd face, towards the bed, and began to smooth down George's
pillow.
Rebecca walked, too, silently any. `` How is Emelia ?'' nskel Jos, who
still held his position in the chair.
here should e somebody with her,'' said Rebecca. :I think she is
very unwell'' and she went away with a very grave once, refusing Mr,
Sedley's entreaties that she would stay and partake of the early dinner
which he had ordered.
Release was of a good-naturel and obliging disposition; and she like
Amelia rather the otherwise. Even her hard words, reproachful as they
were, were complimentary-the groans of a person stinging under defeat.
Meeting Mrs. O'Dowd, whom the Dean's sermons and by no means com-
forted, and who was walking very disconsolately in the Parc, Referee
nccosted the latter, rather to the surprise of the Major's wife, who was not
accustomed to such marks of politeness from Mrs. Rawdon Crowley, and
informing her that poor little MIrs. Osborne was in a desperate condition,
and almost and with grief, sent off the good-natured Irishman straight
to see if she would console her young favourite.
I've cares of my own enough,'' Mrs. O'Dowd said, rarely, '` and I
thought poor Amelia would be little wanting for company this day. bUt
if he's so bad as you say, and you can't attend to her, who used to be so
fond of her, faith I 'll see if I can be of service. And so good morning to
be, Mined ;'' with which speech and a loss of her head, the lady of the
repeater took a farewell of Mrs. Crawley, whose company she by no
means courted.
Becky watched her mareling off, with a smile on her lip. She had the
deepest sense of humour, and the Parthian look which the retreating Mrs.
O'Dowd flung over her shoulder almost upset MIrs. Crawley's gravity.
 My service to be, me fine Madam, and I'm glad to see me so
cheerful,'' thought Peggy. ``It 's not you that will cry your eyes out
with grief, any way,'' And with this she passed on, and speedily found
her way to Mrs. Osborne's lodgings.
The poor soul was still at the chelsea, where Rebecca had left her, and
stood almost crazy with grief. The Major's wife, n stronger minded
woman, endeavoured her best to comfort her young friend,  of must

friend checked it, however: and she was the better of this control and
company. he went on till two o'clock; their hearts were with the
column as it marched further and further away. Dreadful doubt and
anguish-prayers and fears and griefs unspeakable-followed the regiment.
It was the women's tribute to the war. It taxes both like, and takes
the blood of the men, and the tears of the women.
At half-past two an event occurred of daily importance to Mr. Joseph:
the dinner hour carried. Warriors may fight and perish, but he must
ine. He came into Amelia's room to see if he could coax her to share
that meal.  Try,'' said he; `'the soup is very good. Do try, Emmy,''
and he kissed her hand. eXcept when she was married, he had not done
so much for years before.  You are very good and kind, Joseph,'' she
sai.  Everybody is, but, if you please, I will stay in my room to-day.''
The favour of the soup, however, was agreeable to Mrs. O'Dowd's
nostrils: und she thought she would bear Mr. Jos company. So the two
sate down to their meal.  God bless the meat,'' said the Major's wife,
solemuly: she was thinking of her honest Mick, riding at the head of his
argument :  'Is but a bad dinner those poor boys will get to-day,'' sha
sil, with a high, and then, like a philosopher, fell to.
Jos's spirits rose with his meal. He would drink the regiment's health;
or, indeed, take any other excuse to indulge in a glass of champagne.
eWe 'Il drink to O'Down and the brave -th,'' said he, bowing gal-
lastly to his guest.  Hey, Mrs. O'Don. FIll Mrs. O'Dowd's glass,
Isidor.''
But all of a sudden, Isidor started, and the MAjor's wife laid down her
knife and fork. The windows of the room were open, and looked south-
ward, and a dull distant sound came over the sun-lighted roofs from that
direction. : What is it'' sid Jos. :Why don't you pour, you rscal ''
 C'est le fe,'' said Isidor, running to the balcony.
 God defend us; it's canon 1'' MIrs. O'Dowd cried, starting up, and
followed too to the window. A thousand pale and anxious faces might
have been seen looking from other casement. And presently it seemed
as if the whole population of the city rushed into the streets.

Crowds rushed to the

intelligence from the
army. Each man asked
his neighbour for news;
and even great English lords and ladies condescended to speak to persons
whom they did not know. The friends of the French went abroad, wild with
excitement, and prophesying the triumph of their Emperor. The mer-
chants close their shops, and came out to swell the general chorus of alarm
and clamour. Women rushed to the churches, and crowded the chapels, and
knelt and prayed on the flags and steps. The dull sound of the cannon went
on rolling, rolling. Presently carriages with travellers began to leave the
town, galloping away by the Ghent barrier. The prophecies of the French
partisans egan to pass for facts. ``He has cut the armies in two,'' it was
said. IIe is marching straight on Brussels. He will overpower the
English, and be here to-nigel.''  THe will overpower the English,''
shielded Isilor to his master, ``and will be here to-night.'' The man
bounded in and out from the lodgings to the street, always returning with
some fresh particulars of disaster. Jos's face grew paler and paler.
Alarm began to take entire possession of the stout civilian. All the
champagne he drank brought no courage to him. Before sunset he was
worked up to such a pitch of nervousness as gratified his friend Isidor to
behold, who now counted surely upon the spoils of the owner of the laced
cont.
The women were away all this time. After hearing the firing for a
moment, the stout Major's wife bethought her of her friend in the next
chamber, and ran in to watch, and if possible to console, Amelia. The
idea that she had that helpless and gentle creature to protect, give
additional strength to the natural courage of the honest Irislwoman. She

times talking cheerfully, oftener in silence, and terrified mental supplies-
tion. I never let go her hand once,'' said the stout lady afterwards,
`until after sunset, when the firing was over.'' Pauline, the lounge, was
on her knees at church hard ly, praying for son osme a elle.
When the noise of the cannonating was over, MIrs. O'dOwd issued out of
Amelia's room into the parlour adjoining, where Jos sate with two emptied
flasks, and courage entirely gone. Once or twice he had entered into his
sister's bed-room, looking very much alarmed, and as if he would say
something. But the major's wife kept her place, and he went away with-
out lisburthening himself of his speech. He was ashamed to tell her that
he wanted to fly.
But when she made her appearance in the dining-room, where he sat
in the twilight in the sheerness company of his empty clpague-bottles,
he began to open his mind to her.
Mrs. O'Dowd,'' he soil, '` hadn't you better get Amelia redy ?''
`Are you going to take her out a walk '' said the Major's lady;
sure she's too weak to stir,''
I--I'e ordered the carriage,'' he said,  and-and post-horses;

the better on her bed% I've just got her to lie down.''
Get her up,'' sid Jos ; '`sle must get up, i say:'' and he stamped
his foot energetically.  `I say the horses are ordered-yes, the horses are
ordered. It's all over, and-''
 And what'' asked Mrs. O'Dowd.
i'm off for Ghent,'' Jos anywhere. : Everybody is going; there'a
place for you. We shall start in half-an-hour.''
The Major's wife looked at him with infinite scorn. ` Don't move till
O'Down gives me the route,'' said she. : You may go if you like, Mr.
Sedley; but, faith, Amelia and I stop here.''
tHe small go,'' said Jos, with another stamp of his foot. Mrs. O'Down
put herself with arms limbo before the bed-room door.
`Is it her mother you're going to take her to 2'' she said; '` or do you
want to go to Mammy yourself, Mr. Sedley? Good morning- pleasant
journey to ye, sir. Bon voyage, as they say, and take my counsel, and
shave of them pistachios, or they'll bring you into mischief.''
D-n I'' yelled out Jos, wild with fear, rge, and mortification; and
Isidor came in at this juncture, swearing in his turn. Pas de theatre,
aaerehleu '' hissed out the furious domestic. All the horses were gone.
Jos was not the only man in Brussels seized with panic that day.
But Jos's fears, great and cruel and they were already, were destined to
increase to an almost frantic pitch before the night was over. It has been
mentioned ho Pauline, the one, had on love d elle, aleo in the ranks
of the army that had gone out to meet the Emperor Napoleon. This
lover was a native of Brussels, and a Belgian hussar. The troops of his
nation signalized themselves in this war for anything but courage, and

his Colonel's orders to run away. Whilst in garrison at brussels young

Regulus (he had been on in the revolutionary times) found his great
comfort, and passed almost all his leisure moments in Pauline's kitchen;
and it was with pockets and holster crammed full of good things from
her larder, that he had taken leave of his weeping sweetheart, to proceed
upon the campaign a few days lore.
As far as his regiment was concerned, this campaign was over now.
They had forced a part of the division under the command of his Sovereign
apparent; the Prince of Orange, and as respected length of swords and
pistachios, and the richness of uniform and equipments, legulus and
his comrades looked to be as gallant a body of men as ever trumpets
sounded for.
WHen Ney dashed upon the advance of the allied troops, carrying one
position after the other, until the arrival of the great body of the British
any from Brussels changed the aspect of the combat of uatre Bras, the
squadrons among which Regulus role showed the greatest activity in
retreating before the french, and were dislodged from one post and another
which they occupied with perfect nlacrity on their part. Their movements
were only checked by the advance of the British in their recur. thus
force to halt, the enemy's cavalry (whose bloothirsty obstinacy cannot
be too severely reprehnded) had at length an opportunity of coming to
close quarters with the brave BElgians before them; who preferred to
counter the British rather than the French, and at once turning tail rode
through the english regiments that were behind them, and scattered in all
directions. The regiment in fact did not exist any more. It wasnowhere.
It had no head quarters. Regulus found himself galloping many miles from
the field of action, entirely alone; and whither should he fly for refuge so
naturally us to that kitchen and those faithful arms in which online had
so often welcomed him?
At some ten o'clock the clinking of a sabre might have been heard up
the star of the house where the Osborne occupied n storey in the cou-
internal fashion. A knock might have been heard at the kitchen door;
and poor Pauline, come back iron church, fainted almost with terror as
she opened it and saw before her her laggnrd hussar. He looked as pale
as the midnight dragoon who came to disturb Leonora. Pauline would
have screamed, but that her cry would have called her masters, and his-
covered her friend. She stifled her scream, then, and lending her hero
into the kitchen, gave him beer, and the choice bits from the dinner, which
Jos had not had the heart to taste. The hussar showed he was no ghost
by the prodigious quantity of lesh und beer which he devoured-and
during the mouthfuls he told his tale of disaster.
His regiment had performed prodigies of courage, and had withstood
for a while the onset of the whole french army. But they were over-
whelmed at last, as was the whole British army by this time. Ney
destroyed each regiment as it became. The bElgians in vain iuterposed
to prevent the butchery of the English. Tho Brunswvickers were routed
and had fled-their Duke was killed. It was a general delicle. He
sought to drown his sorrow for the defeat in floods of beer.
Isidor, who had come into the kitchen, heard the conversation, and
rushed out to inform his master.  `It is all over,'' he shielded to Jcs.

beer. In the best French which he could muster, and which was in south
of a very ungrammatical sort, Jos besought the hussar to tell his tale.
The disasters deepened as Reguls spoke. He was the only man of his
regiment not slain on the field. He had seen the Duke of Brunswick full,
the black hussars fly, the Ecossais pounded down by the cannon.
``And the -th?'' gasped Jos.
Cut in pieces,'' said the hussar-upon which Pauline crying out, ``OF
my mistress, ma bound petite day,'' went off fairly into hysterics, and
filled the house with her screams.
Wil with terror, MIr. Sedley knew not how or where to seek for safety.
He rushed from the kitchen back to the sitting-room, and cast an appeal-
in look at Amelia's door, which Mrs. O'Down had closed and looked in
his face; but he remembered how scornfully the latter had received him,
and after pausing and listening for a brief space at the door, he left it,
and resolved to go into the street, for the first time that day. So, seizing
an candle, hc looked about for his gold-laced cap, and found it lying in its
usual place, on a console-table, in the ante-room, placed before s mirror
at which Jos used to roquet, always giving his side-locks a twirl, and his
cap the proper cock over his eye, before he cut forth to make appearance
in public. Such is the force of habit, that even in the midst of his terror
he began mechanically to twiddle with his hair, and arrange the cock of

They will mistake me for a military man, thought he, remembering Isidor's
warning, as to the massacre with which all the defeated British army s
threatened; and staggering back to his bed-chamber, he began wildly pulling
the bell which summoned his valet.
Isidor answered that summons. Jos had sunk in a chair-he had torn
off his neckcloths, and turned down his collars, and was sitting with both
his hands lifted to his throat.

Isidor thought for a moment he had gone mad, and that he wished lis

too,'' And so having said, he plunged swiftly down the stairs of the
house, and passed into the street.
Although calculus had owed that he was the only man of his regiment
or of the allied army, almost, who had escaped being cut to pieces by Ney, it
appeared that his statement was incorrect, and that a good number more
of the supposed victims had survived the massacre. Many scores of
Regulus's comrades had found their way back to Brussels, and-all agree-
in that they had run away-filled the whole town with an idea of the
defeat of the allies. The arrival of the French was expected hourly; the
panic continued, and preparations for flight went on everywhere. No
horses though Is, in terror. IIe made lsidor inquire of scores of
persons, whether they had any to lend or sell, and his heart sank within
him, at the negative answers returned everywhere. Should he take the
journey on foot? Even fear could not render that ponderous body so
active.
Almost all the hotels occupied by the English in 3brussels face the
Park, and Jos wandered irresolutely about in this quarter, with crowds
of other people, oppressed and he was by fear and curiosity. Soe families
he saw more happy than himself, having discovered a team of horses, and
rattling through the streets in retreat; others again there were whose case
was like his own, and who could not for any bribes or cutrcaties procure
the necessary means of flight. Amongst these would-be fugitives, Jos
remarked the Lady Bureaceres and her daughter, who stein theircarriage
in the pre-coelre of their hotel, all their imperials packed, and the
only drawback to whose flight was the same want of motive power which
kept Jos stationary.
Rebecca Crawley occupied apartments in this hotel ; and had before this
period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladies of the Breaches
family. My Lady bBareacres cut Mrs. Crawley on the stairs when they
met by chance; and in all places where the latter's name was men-
toned, spoke perscvcringly ill of her neighbour. The Countess was
shocked at the familiarity of (general tufto with the aide-de-camp's wife.
The Lady Blanche avoided her as if she had been an infectious disease.
Only the Euro himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her, when
out of the jurisdiction of his ladies.
Rebecca lad her revenge now upon these insolent enemies. It became
known in the hotel that Captain Crawley's horses had been left behind, and
when the panic began, Lady Decrease condescended to send her maid to
the Captain's wife with her Ladyship's compliments, an a desire to know
the price of MIrs. Crawley's losses. Mrs. Crawley returned a note with her

bargains with allies' maids.
This curt reply brought the Earl in person to Becky's apartment ; but
he could get no more success than the first ambassador. `` Send a lady's

Breaches tell me to go and sadly the horses Is it her Ladyslip that
wants to escape, or her Ladyship's fee de claire 2'' And this was all
the answer that the Earl bore back to his Countess.
What will not necessity do The Countess herself actually came to
wait upon Mrs. Crawley of the failure of her second convoy. She entrusted
her to name her own price; she even ollered to invite bEcky to laureates
COurse, if the latter would but give her the means of returning to tlmnt
residence. Mrs, Crawley sneered at her.
I dont want to be waited on by builifIs in livery,'' she said; 'you
will never get back though most probably-at least, not you and your
diamonds together. The french will have those. he will be here in
two hours, and I shall be half way to Ghent by that time. I would not

were at the all.'' Lady Breweries treble with rage and terror. IT

and boots. `Women, the diamonds rc at the ner's, and I will have

tess went below, and state in her carriage; her mind, her courier, and her
husband were sent once more through the town, each to look for cattle; and

the very instant the horses arrived from any quarter-with her husband
or without him.
rebecca had the pleasure of seeing her Airship in the horseless car-
ridge, and keeping her eyes fixed upon her, nd detailing, in the loudest
tone of voice, the Countess's perplexities. `Not to be able to get forces!''
she said, `` and to have all those diamonds sewcd in to the carriage cushions
What a prize it will be for the French when they come l-the caring and
the diamonds I mean; not the lady'' She gave this information to
the landlord, to the servants, to the guests, and the innumerable stragglcrs
about the court-yard. Lady Breweries could have shot her from the car-
ridge-window.
It was while enjoying the humiliation of her enemy the Tribeca cult
sight of Jos, who made towards ler directly he perceived her.
That altered, frightened, fat face, told his secret well enough. He
too wanted to fly, and was on the look-out for the means of escape, `'IIe

Jos walked up to his friend, and put the question for the hundredth
time during the past hour, `` Dil she know where horses were to be had''

the champion of all the ladies, Mr. Sedley.''

Besides, I don't want to desert her,'' cried te brother.  She sha't
e deserted. There is  seat for her in my carriage, and one for you, dear
Mrs. Crawley, if you will come; and if we can get horses-'' sighed he-
I have to to sell,'' the lady said. Jos could have flung himself into
her arms at the news. `' Get the carriage, Isilor,'' he cried; ` we 've
found them-we have found them.''
My horses never were in harness,'' added the lady. ``Bulfinuch would
kick the carriage to pieces, if you put him in the traces.''
But he is quiet to ride?'' asked the civilian.
As quiet as a lamb, and as fast as a hare,'' answered Receive.
Do you think he is up to my weight?'' Jos said. HIe was already
on his back, in imagination, without ever so much as a thought for poor
Amelia. What person who led a horse-speculation could resist such a
temptation
In reply, Rebecca asked him to come into her room, wlither he followed
her quite breathless to conclude the bargain. Jos seldom spent a half
hour in his life which cost him so much money. Rebecca measuring the
value of the goods which she had for sale by Jos's eagerness to purchase,
as well as by the scarcity of the article, put upon her horses a price so
prodigious as to make even the civilian draw baek.  She would sell
both or neither,'' she said, resolutely. Rnwdon had ordered her not to
part with the for a price less than that which she specified. Lord
lareaceres below would give her the same money-and with all her love
and regard for the Sedley family, er dear Mr. Joseph must conceive that
poor people must live-nobody, in a word, could be more affectionate, but
more firm about the matter of business.
Jos ended by agreeing, as might be supposed of him. The sum he had
to give her was so large that he was obliged to ask for time; so large as
to be a little fortune to Rebecca, who rapidly cnleulnted that with this
sum, and the sale of the residue of Rawdon's effects, and her pension as a
widow should he fell, she would now be absolutely independent of the
world, and might look her weeds steadily in the face.
Once or twice in the day she certainly hal herself thought about flying.
But her reason gave her better counsel. ``Suppose the French to come,''
thought Becky, 'what can they do to a poor officer's widow2 Bahl the
times of sacks and sieges arc over. We shall be set to go he quietly,
or I may live pleasantly abroad with a snug little income.''
Meanwhile Jos and Isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly-
purchased cattle. Jos bade his man saddle the horses at once. He
would ride away that very night, that very hour. And he left the valet
busy in getting the horses ready, and went homewards himself to prepare
for his departure. It must be secret. he would go to his chamber by
the back entrance. He did not care to face Mrs, O'Dowd and Amelia,
and on to them that he was about to run.
By the time Jos's bargain with Rebecca was completed, and his horses
had been visited anl examined, it was almost morning once more. But

though midnight was long passed, there was no rest for the city ; the
people were up, the lights in the houses flames, crowds were still about
the doors, and the streets were busy. Rumours of various natures went
still from mouth to mouth: one report inverse that the Prussians had been
utterly defeated; another that it was the English who had been attacked
and conquered; a third that the latter and held their ground. This
last rumour gradually got strength. No Frenchmen had made their
appearance. Stragglers and come in from the army bringing reports more
and more favourable: nt last an aide-le-camp actually reached Brussels
with despatches for the Commandant of the place, who placarded presently
through the town an official announcement of the success of the allies at
(uatre Bras, and the entire repulse of the French under Ney after a six
hours' battle. The aide-de-camp must have arrived sometime while Jos
and Rebecca were making their bargain together, or the latter was suspect-
in his purchase. When ho reached his own hotel, he found a score of its
numerous inhabitants on the threshold discussing of the news; there was
no doubt as to its truth. And he went up to communicate it to the ladies
under his care. lIe did not think it was necessary to tell them how he
had intended to take leave of them, how he had bought horses, and what
price he had paid for them.
But success or defeat was a minor matter to them, who had only thought
for the safety of those they loved. Amelia, at the news of the victory,
became still more agitated even the before. She was for going that mo-
went to the army. She besought her brother with tears to conduct her
thither. TIer doubts and terrors reached their paroxysm; and the poor
girl, who for many hours had been plunged into stupor, raved and ran
hither and thither in hysteric insanity-a pious sight. No man writhing
in pain on the hard-fought field fifteen miles of, where lay, after their
struggles, so many of the brave-no mn suffered more keenly than this
poor harmless victim of the war. Jos could not bear the sight of her pain.
IIe left his sister in the charge of her stouter female companion, and
descended once more to the threshold of the hotel, where everybody still
lingered, and talked, and wnitel for more news.
It grew to be brond light as they stood lere, and fresh news began
to arrive from the war, brought by men who had been actors in the scene.
Wagons and long country carts laden with wounded cne rolling into tlc
town; ghastly gross cme from within them, and haggard faces looked up
sadly from out of the straw. Jos Sedley was looking at one of gliese
carriages with a painful curiosity-the means of the people within were

had defended very gallantly upon the field. A French lancer hal secured

in a cart, and he had been brought back to russell.

almost frightened at the appeal. IIe had not at first distinguished who
it was that called lim.
Little Tom trouble held out his lot and feeble hand. I'm to be
taken in here,'' he said.  Osborne-and-and Dobbin said I was; and
you are to give the man two Napoleons : my mother will pay you.'' This
young fellow's thoughts, during the long feverish hours passed in the
cnrt, had been wandering to his father's parsonnge which he had quieted
only a few months before, and he and sometimes forgotten lis pain in
that delirium.
The hotel was large, and the people kind, and all the inmates of the
car were taken in and placed on various couches. he young ensign
was convert up-stairs to Osborne's quarters. Amelia and the MAjor's
wife had rushed down to him, when the latter had recognized him from the
nl]copy. ou may fancy the feelings of these women when they were
told that the day was over, and both their husbands were safe; in what
mute rupture Amelia fell on her good friend's neck, and embraced her;
in what s grateful passion of prayers she fell on her knees, and thanked
the Power which had saved her husband.
Our young lady, in her fevered and nervous condition, could have had
no ore snlutary medicine prescribed for her by any physician tan that
which chance put in her way. She and Mrs. O'Dowd watched incessantly
by the wounded lad, whose pains were very severe, and in the duty thus
forced upon her, Amelia had not time to brood over her personal anxieties,
or to give herself up to her own fars and forebodings after her wont.
The young patient told in his simple fashion the events of the day, and
the nations of our friends of the gallant -th. They had suffered
severely. They had lost very many officers and men. The Infor's
horse had been shot under him as the regiment charged, and they all
thought that O'Dowd was gone, and the Dohbin lad got his majority,
until on their return from the charge to their old ground, the Major
was discovered seated on yramus's carcass, refreshing himself from a
case-battle. It was Captain Osborne that cut down the renal lower
clio and sparked the ensign. Abelian turned so pale at the notion, that
MIrs. O'Dowd stopped the young ensign in this story. And it was Cap-
tain Dobbin who at the end of the day, though wounded himself, took up
the Ipad in his arms and carried him to the surgeon, and thence to the car
which was to bring him back to I3russell. And it was he who promised
the river to louis if he would make his way to Mr. Sedley's hotel in
1the city; and tell Mrs. Captain Osborne that the action was over, and that
her husband was unhurt and well.
 Indeed, but he has a good heart that William Dolbin,'' MIrs. O'Dod
said, '`though he is always laughing at me.'
oung Stubble vowed there was not such another officer in the army,
and never ceased his praises of the senior captain, his modesty, his kind-
ess, and his admirable coolness in the field. To these parts of the
conversation, helping lent a very distracted attention: it was only when

George was spoken of that she listened, and when he was not mentioned,
she thought about him.
In tending her patient, and in thinking of the wonderful essence of the
day before, her second day passed away not too slowly with uclin. here
was only one man in the army for her: and as long as he was well, it must
be known that its movements interested hcr little. All the reports which
Jos brought from the streets full very vaguely on her ears; though they
were sufficient to give that timorous gentleman, and many other people
then in Brussels, very disquiet. he kF'reach had been repulsed certainly,
but it was after a severe and doubtful struggle, and with only a division of
the French army. The Emperor, with the main oly, was away at Ligny,
where he had utterly annihilated the Prussians, and was now are to bring
his whole forced to bear upon the allies. 1he Duke of Wellington was
retreating upon the capital, and a great battle must be fought under its
walls probably, of which the chances were more than doubtful. The Duke
of Wellington had but twenty thousand BRitish troops on whom he could
rely, for the Germans were raw militia, the Belgians disaffected; and with
this handful his Grace had to resist a hundred and fifty thousand men that
had broken into Belgium under Napoleon. Under Napoleon 1 What warrior
was there, however famous and skilful, that could fight at olds with him
Jos thought of all these things, and trembled. So did all the rest of
Brussels-where people felt that the felt of the day before was but the
prelude to the greater combat which was imminent. One of the armies
opposed to the Emperor was scattered to the winds already. The few
English that could be brought to resist him would perish at their posts,
and the conqueror would pass over their bodies into the city. Woe be to
those whom he found there Addresses were prepared, public function-
aries assembled and dental secretly, apartments were got realy, and
tricooloured banners and triumphal emblems manufactured, to welcome the
arrival of His Majesty the Emperor and King.
The emigration still continued, and wherever families could find means
of departure, they fled. When Jos, on the afternoon of the 17th of June,
went to Rebecca's hotel, he found that the great DDareacres' carriage had at
length rolled away from the porte-college. The Earl had procured a pair
of horses somehow, in spite of Mrs. Crawley, and was rolling on the road
to Ghent. Louis the Desired, was getting ready his portmanteau in that
city, too. It seemed as if Misfortune was never tired of worrying into
motion that unwieldy exile.
Jos felt that the delay of yesterday had been only a respite, and that his
dearly bought horses must of a surety le put into requisition. His
agonies were very severe all this day. as long as there was an English
army between Brussels and Napoleon, there was no need of immediate
flight; but he had his horses brought from their distant stables, to the
stables in the court-yard of the hotel where he lived; svo that try might
be under his own eyes, and beyond the risk of violent auction. Isidor
watched the stable-door constantly, and had the horses saddled, to be ready
for the start. He longed intensely for that event.
After the reception of the previous day, Reach did not care to come

her, and gave fresh water to the flowers, and read or the letter which
he had sent her.  Poor wretch,'' she said, twirling round the little bit
of paper in her fingers, ``how I could crush her with this-and it is for
a thing like this that she must break her heart forsyth-for a man who
is stupid-a newcomb-and who does not care for her. My poor good
Rawdon is worth ten of this creature.'' And then she fell to thinking
what she should do if-if anything happened to poor good Rawdon, and
what a great piece of luck it was that he had left his horses behind.
In the course of this day too, Mrs. Crawley, who saw not without anger
the Bareacrcs party drive off, becthought her of the precaution which the
countess had taken, and did a little needlewvork for own advantage; she
stitched way the major part of her triukets, bills, and bank-notes about
her person, and so prepared, was ready for any event-to fly if she
thought it, or to stay and welcome the conqueror, were he Englishman or
Frenchman. And I am not sure that she did not drew that night of
becoming a duchess and Madame la Marshall, while Rawdon wrapped in
his cloak, and making his bivouac under the rain at Mount Saint John,
was thinking, with all the force of his heart, about the little wife whom he
had left behind him.
The next day was  Sunday. Anl MIrs. Major O'Dod hal the sats-
faction of seeing both her patients refreshed in health and spirits by some
rest which they had taken during the night. She herself had slept on a
great chair in Amelia's room, ready to wait upon her poor friend or
the ensign, should either need her nursing. WHen morning came, this
robust woman went back to the house where she and her MAjor had their
billet; and here performed n elaborate and splendid toilette, befitting the
dy. And it is very possible that whilst alone in that chamber, which
her husband had inhabited, and where his cnp still lay on the pillow, and
his cane stood in the corner, one prayer at least was sent up to Heaven
for the welfare of the brave soldier, Michael O'Dowd.
WHen she returned she brought her prayer-book with her, and her
uncle the Dean's famous book of sermons, out of which she never failed to
end every Sabbath: not understanding all, haply, not pronouncing many
of the words right, which were long and abstruse-for the Deal was a
learned mau, and loved long Latin words-but with great gravity, vast
emphasis, and with tolerable correctness in the main. How often has my
Mick listened to these serious, she thought, and me reading in the cabin
of a calm. She proposed to reduc this exercise on the present day, with
Amelia and the wounded ensign for a congregation. The same service
was read on that day in twenty thousand churches at the same hour; and
millions of British men and women, on their knees, implored protection of
the Father of all.
They did not hear the noise which disturbed our little congregation at
Brussels. Much louder than that clich had interrupted the two day
previously, as Mrs. O'Dowd was reading the service in her best voice, the
cannon of Waterloo began to roar.
When Jos heard that dreadful sound, he made up his mind that he
would bear this perpetual recurrence of terrors no longer, and would fly at

paused in their prayers, and further interrupted them by a passionate
appeal to Amelia.
I can't stand it any more, Emmy,'' he said ; `I won't stand it; and
you must come with me. I have bought a horse for you-never mind
nt what price-and you must dress and come with me, and ride behind
Isidor.''
God forgive me, Mr. Sedley, but you are no better than a coward,''
Mrs. O'Dowd said, laying down the book.
`:I say coe, Amelia,'' the civilian went on; ``never mind what she
says; why are we to stop here and be butchered by the Frenchmen ?''
 You forget the -th, my boy,'' said the little Stubble, the wounded
hero, From his bed-``and-and you won't leave me, will you, Mrs.

har shall come to you while I stand by.  I don't budge till I get the
world from Mick. A pretty figure I'd be, wouldn't I, stuck behind that

This image made the young patient to burst out laughing in his bed,
and even made Amelia smile.  I don't ask her,'' Jos shouted out-i
don't ask that-that Irishmen, but you, Amelia; once for all, will you

Without my husband, Joseph?'' Amelia said with a look of wonder,
and gave her hand to the Major's wife. Jos's patience was exshaustecl.
 Good bye, then,'' he said, shaking his fist in a rage, and slamming the
door by which he retreated. And this time he really gave his order for

ing hoofs of the horses as they issued from the gate; and looking on, are
many scornful remarks on poor Joseph as he rode dow the street with
Isidor after him in the laced cnp. The horses, which had not been exercised
for some days, were lively, and sprang about the street. Jos, a clumsy
and tied horseman, did not look to advantage in the saddle. ` Look at
hi, Aelia, denr, driving into the parlour window. Such n bull in n
china-shop I never saw.'' And presently the pair of riders disappeared
at a canter down the street scaling in the direction of the Ghent road.

in sight.
All that day from morning until past sunset, the cannon never ceased to
roar. It was dark when the cannonading stopped all of a sudden.
All of us have read of what occurred during that interval. The tale is
in every Englishman's mouth; and you and I, who were children when
the great battle was won and lost, are never tired of hearing and recount-
in the history of that famous action. Its remembncc rankles still in
the bosoms of millions of the countries of those brave men who lost the
day. They want for an opportunity of preventing that humiliation; and if
a contest, ending in a victory on their part, should ensue, eating them in
their turn, and leaving its cursed legacy of hatred and rage behind to us,
there is no end to the so-called glory and shame, and to the alternations
of successful and unsuccessful murder, in which two high-spirited nations
might engage. Centuries hence, we Frenchmen and englishmen might be

boasting and killing each other still, carrying out bravely the Deal's code
of honour.
All our friends took their share nd fought like men in the great field.
All day long, whilst the women were praying ten miles away, the lines
of the dauntless English infantry were receiving and repelling the furious
charges of the French horsemen. Guns which were heard nt Brus-
sets were ploughing up their ranks, and comrades falling, and the
resolute survivors closing in. Towards evening, the attack of the French,
repeated and resisted so barely, blackened in its fury. They had other
focus besides the British to engage, or were preparing for a final onset.
t came at last : the columns of the Imperial Guard marched up the hill
of Saint Jean, at length and at one to sweep the English from the
light which they had maintained all day, and spite of all: unscared by
the thunder of the artillery, which hurled death from the English line-thc
dark rolling column pressed on and up the bill. It seemed almost to
crest the eminence, when it began to have and falter. Then it stopped,
still facing the shot. Then at last the English troops rushed from the
post from which no enemy had been able to dislodge them, and the Guard
turned and fled.
No more ring was heard at Brussels-the pursuit rolled miles away.
The darkness came down on the field and city, and Amelia was prying
for George, who was lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through his
heart.

member-while the army is march-
in from Flanders, and, after its
heroic actions there, is advancing
to take the fortifications on the
frontiers of France, previous to an
occupation of that country,-that
there are a number of persons living
peaceably in England who have to
do with the history at present in
hand, and must come in for their
share of the chronicle. During the
time of these battles and dangers,
old Miss Crawley was living at
Brighton, very moderately moved
by the great events that were going
on. The great events rendered the
newspapers rather interesting, to be sure, and Briggs read out the Gazette,
in which Rawdon Crawley's gallautry was mentioned with honour, and his
promotion to be Lieutenant-Colonel was presently recorded.
 What a pity that young man has taken such in irretrievble step in the
world,'' his aunt said; '' with his rank and distinction e might have married
a brewer's daughter with a quarter of a million-like Miss Grains; or have
looked to ally himself with the best families in England. He would have
had my money some day or other; or his children would-for I'm not
in a hurry to go, Miss Briggs, although you may be in a hurry to be
rid of me; and instead of that, he is a doomed pnuper, with a dancing-
 girl for a wide.''
 Will my dear Miss Crawley not cast an eye of compassion upon
the heroic soldier, whose name is inscribed in the annals of his country's
glory 2'' said Miss Briggs, who was greatly excited by the Waterloo
proceedings, and loved speaking romantically when there was an occasion.
` Has not the Captain-of the Colonel as I may now style him-done
deeds which make the name of Crowley illustrious''
 Briggs, you are a fool,'' said Miss Crawley : t Colonel Crawley has
dragged the name of Crawley through the mud, Miss Briggs. Marry a
drawing-master's daughter, indeed-marry a dame de companies-for
she was no better, Briggs; no, she was just what you are-only younger,
and a great deal prettier and clever. Were you an accomplice of that

abandoned wretch, I wonder, of whose vile arts he became a victim, and
of whom you used to be such an admirer Ies, I daresay you were an
accomplice. But you will find yourself disappointed in my will, I can
tell you: and you will have the goodness to write to Mr. Waxy, and say
that I desire to see him immediately.'' Miss Crawley was now in the
habit of writing to Mr. Waxy her solicitor almost every day in the week,
for her arrangements respecting her property were all revoked, and her
perplexity was great as to the future disposition of her money.
The spinster had, however, rallied considerably; as was proved by the
increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasm upon Miss Briggs, all
which attacks the poor companion bore with weakness, with cowardice,
with a resignation that was half generous, and half hypocritical-with the
slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and station
are compelled to show. Who has not seen how women bully women:
WHat tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily-repeated
shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the
tyrants of their sex Poor victims But we are starting from our
proposition, which is, that MIss Crawley was always particularly annoy-
ing and savage when she was bullying from illness-as they say wounds
tingle most when they are about to heal.
WHile thus approaching, as all hoped, to convlescence, Miss Briggs
was the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid; yet Miss
Crawley's relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman, and by
a number of tokens, presents, and kind affectionate messages, store to
keep themselves alive in her recollection.
In the first place, let us mention her nephew, Rawdon Crawley. A
few weeks after the famous fight of Waterloo, and after the Gazette had
are known to her the promotion and gallantry of that distinguished
officer, the Dieppe packet brought over to Miss Crawley at Brighton, a
box containing presents, and a dutiful letter, from the Colonel her nephew.
In the box were a pair of French epaulets, a Cross of the LEgion of
Honour, and the hilt of a sword-relics from the field of battle: and the
letter described with a good deal of humour low the latter belonged to a
commanding-officer of the Guard, who having sworn that ` the Guard
lied, but never surrendered,'' was taken prisoner the next minute by a
private soldier, who broke the Frenchman's sword with the butt of his
musket, when Rawdon made himself master of the shattered weapon.
As for the cross d epaulets, they came from a Colonel of French
cavalry, who had fallen under the aide-de-camp's arm in the battle: and

The spinster caused Briggs to write back to the Colonel a gracious
and complimentary letter, encouraging him to continue his correspondence.
HIs first letter was so excessively lively and amusing that she should look
with pleasure for its successors.- Of course I know,'' she explained to

Miss Briggs, '` that Rawdon could not write such a good letter any more
than you could, my poor Briggs, and that it is that clear little wretcl ol
na rebecca, who dictates every word to him; but that is no reason why
my nephew should not amuse me; and so I wish to let him understand
that I am in high good-humour.''
I wonder whether she knew that it was not only llecky who wrote the
letters, but that Mrs. Wilson actually took and sent home the trophies-
which she bought for a few frames, from one of the innumerable pedlars,
who immediately began to deal in relics of the war. The novelist, who
knows everything, knows this also. Be this, however, is it may, Miss
Crawley's gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends Haddon
and his lady, who hoped for the best from their aunt's evidently pacified
humour: and they took care to entertain her with many delightful
letters from Pris, whither, ns Ruwdon said, they had the good luck to go
in the track of the conquering army.
To the rector's ldy, who went off to tend her husband's broken
collar-bone at the Director at queen's Crawley, the spinster's comuni-
cations were by no means so gracious. Mrs. Bute, that brisk, manage-
ing, lively, imperious women, had committed the most fatal of all errors
with regard to her sister-in-law. She nhl not rely oppressed her and
her household-she had bored Miss Crawley : and if poor Miss Briggs
has been a woman of any spirit, she might have been made happy by
the commission which her principal gave her, to write a letter to Mrs.
Bute Cruelty, saying that Miss Crawley's health was greatly improved
since Mrs. ute had left her, and begging the luster on no account to pt
herself to trouble, or quit her family for Miss Crawley's sake. This
triumph over a lady who has been very haughty and cruel in her beta-
vigour to Miss Briggs, would have rejoice most women; but the truth
is, Briggs was a woman of no spirit at nll, and the moment her enemy
was discomfited she began to feel compassion in her favour.
eeHIow silly I was,'' Mrs. lUte thought, and with reason, ``ever to

why did you break your collar-bone?''
Why, indeed We have seen how Mrs. Bute, having the game in her
hands, hal really played her cards too well. She has ruled over Miss
Crawley's household utterly and completely, to be utterly and completely
routed when n favourable opportunity for rebellion came. She and her
household, however, considered that she had been the victim of horrible
selfishness and treason, and that her sacrifices in Miss Crowley's behalf
had met with the most savage ingratitude. Rawdon's promotion, and the
honourable mention made of his name in the Gazette, filled this good
Christian lady also with alarm. Would his aunt relent towards him now
that he was a Colonel and a C..P and would that odious Rebecca once
more get into favour2 The rector's wife wrote a sermon for her husband

syllable of it. He had Pitt Crawley for one of his auditors-Pitt, who had
come with his two half-sisters, to church, which the old Baronet could now
by now means be brought to frequent.
Since the departure of Becky Sharp, that old wretch had given himself
up entirely to his bad courses, to the great scandal of the county and the
mute horror of his son. The ribbons in Miss Horrocks's cap became more
splendid than ever. The polite families fled the hall and its owner in
terror. Sir Pitt went about tippling at his tenants' houses; and drank
rum-and-water with the farmers at Sudbury and the neighbouring places
on market-days. He drove the family conch-and-four to Southampton
with Miss Horrocks inside: and the county people expected, every week,
as his son did in speechless agony, that his manage with her would be
announced in the provincial paper. It was indeed a rude further for Mr.
Crawley to bear. His eloquence was palsied at the missionary meetings,
and other religious assemblies in the neighbourhood, where he had been in
the habit of presiding, and of speaking for hours; for he felt, when he
rose, that the audience said, ``That is the son of the old reprobate Sir
Pitt, who is very likely drinking at the public-house at this very moment.''
And once when he was speaking of the benighted condition of the king of
Timbuctoo, and the number of his wives who were likewise in darkness,
some tipsy miscrennt from the crowd asked,  How many is there at
queen's Crawley, oung quaretoesP'' to the surprise of the platform,
and the run of Mr. Pitt's speech. Md the two daughters of the house
of queen's Crawley would have been allowed to run utterly wild (for Sin
Pitt swore that no governess should ever enter into his doors again), had
not Mr. Crawley, by threatening the old gentleman, forced the latter to
send them to school.
MEanwhile, as we have said, whatever individual differences there might
be between them all, Miss Crawley's dear nephews and nieces were
unanimous in loving her and sending her tokens of affection. Thus Mrs.
Bute sent guinea-fowls, and somc remarkably fine cauliflower, and a pretty
purse or inclusion worked by her darling girls, who begged to keep a
little place in the recollection of their dear aunt, while Mr. Pitt sent
heracles and grapes and venison from the Hall. The Southampton coach
used to carry these tokens of affection to Miss Crawley at Brighton : it
used sometimes to convey Mr. Pitt thither too : for his differences with Sir
Pitt cause Mr. Crawley to absent himself a good deal from home now:
and besides, he had an attraction at Brighton in the person of the Lady
Jane Sheepshanks whose engagement to Mr. Crawley has been formerly
mentioned in this history. Her Ladyship and her sisters lived at Brighton
with their mamma, the Countess Touchdown, that strong-minded woman
so favourably known in the serious world.
A few words ought to be said regarding her Lalyship nd her noble
family, who are bound by ties of present and future relationship to the
house of Crawley. Respecting the chief of the Touchdown family, Clement
William, fourth Earl of Touchdown, little need be told, except that his
Lordship came into Parliament (as Lord WOlsey), under the auspices of
M. WilbErforce, and for a time was a credit to is political sponsor, and
decidedly a serious young man. But words cannot describe the feelings

of his admirable mother, when she learned, very shortly after her noble
husband's demise, that her son was a member of several worldly clubs, had
lost largely at play at Wattiers and the Cocoa TRee; that he had raised
money on post-bits, and encumbered the family estate; that he drove
four-in-hand, and patronized the ring; and that he actually had an opera-
box, where he entertained the most dangerous bachelor company. His
name was only mentioned with groans in the dowager's circle.
The Lady Emily was her brother's senior by many years; and took
considerable rank in the serious world as author of some of the delightful
traits before mentioned, and of many hymns and spiritual pieces. A
mature spinster, and having but faint ideas of marriage, her love for the
blacks occupied almost all her feelings. It is to her, I believe, we owe
that beautiful poem,-
 Lead us to come sunny male,
Yonder in the western deep;
Where the skies for ever smile,
And the blacks for ever weep,'' &a
She and correspondences with clerical gentlemen in most of our
East and West India possessions; and was secretly attached to
the Reverend Silas Hornblower, who was tattooed in the South Sen
Islands.
As for the Lady Jane, on whom, as it has been said, Mr. Pitt
Crawley's affection had been placed, she was gentle, blushing, silent,
and timid. In spite of his falling away, she wept for her brother, and was
quite ashamed of loving him still. Even yet she used to send him little
hurried smuggled notes, and pop them in the post in private. The one
dreadful secret which weighed upon her life was, that she and the old
housekeeper had been to pay Touchdown a further visit at his chambers in
the Albany; and found him-TO the naughty dear abandoned wretchl
smoking a cigar with a bottle of Caracas before him. She admired her
sister, she alfred her mother, she thought Mr. Crawley the most delight-
ful and accomplished of men, after Touchdown, that fallen angel: and her
mamma and sister, who were ladies of the most superior sort, managed
everything for her, and regarded her with that amiable pity, of which
your really superior woman always has such a share to give any. Her
mamma ordered her dresses, her books, her bonnets, and her ideas for her.
She was made to take pony-riding, or pino-exercise, or any other sort of
bodily impediment, according as my lady Touchdown saw meet; and her
ladyship would have kept her daughter in pinafores up to her present age
of six-and-twenty, but that they were thrown off when Lady Jane was
presented to queen Charlotte.
When these ladies first came to their house at Brighton, it was to them
alone that Mr. Crawley paid his personal visits, contenting himself by leaving
a card at his aunt's house, and making a modest inquiry of Mr, Bowls or his
assistant footman, with respect to the health of the inlid. When he met
Miss Briggs coming home from the library with a cargo of novels under
her arm, Mr. Crawley brushed in a manner quite unusual to him, as he

introduced Miss Briggs to the lady with whom he happened to be walking,
the Lady Jane Sheepshanks, saying, ''Lady Jane, permit me to introduce
to you my aunt's kindest friend and most affectionate companion, Miss
Briggs, whom you know under another title, as authors of the delightful
`Lyrics of the Heart,' of which you are so fond.'' Lady Janeblushed too
as she held out a kind little hand to Miss Briggs, and said something very
civil and incoherent about mamma, and proposing to call on Miss Crawley,
and being glad to be made known to the friends and relatives of Mr.

separated, while Pitt Crawley treated her to a profound courtly bow, such

which he remembered to have seen at queen's Crawley, with a dedication
from the poetess to his father's late wife; and he brought the volume with
him to brighton, reading it in the Southampton coach, and making it
with his own pencil, before he presented it to the gentle Lady June.
It was he, too, who laid before Lady Touchdown the great advantageswhich
might occur from an intimate between her family and Miss Crawley,--
advantages oth worldly and spiritual, he said: for Miss Crawley was now
quite lone; the monstrous dissipation and alliance of his brother Rawdon,
had estranged her affections from that rcprobute young man; the greedy
tyranny and avarice of Mrs. Bute Crawley had caused the old lady to
revolt against the exorbitant pretensions of the part of the family; and
though he himself had hell of all his life from cultivating Miss Crawley's
friendship, with perhaps an improper pride, he thought now that every
becoming means should be taken, both to see her soul from perdition, and
to secure cr fortune to himself as the head of the house of Crawley.
The strong-minded Lady Touchdown quite agreed in both proposals of
her son-in-law, and was for converting Miss Crawley of hand. At her
own home, both at Soutludown and at Trottermore Castle, this tall and
awful missionary of the truth rode about the country in her barouche with
outsiders, launched packets of tracts among the cottagers and tenants, and
would order Gaffer Jones to be converted, as she would order Goody HIcks
to take a James's powder, without appeal, resistance, or benefit of clergy.
My Lord Touchdown, her late husband, an epileptic and simple-minded
nobleman, was in the habit of approving of everything which his Matilda
lid and thought. So that whatever changes her own belief might undergo
(and it aeeomolated itself to a prodigious variety of opinion, taken from
all sorts of doctors among the Dissenters) she had not the least scruple in
ordering all hcr tenants and inferiors to follow and believe after her. Thus
whether she received the Reverend Saunders CeNtre the Scotch
living; or the reverend Luke Waters the mild Wesleyan; or the Reverend
(iles Jowls the illuminated Cobbler who dubbed himself Reverend as
napoleon crowned himself Emperor-the household, children, infantry
of my Lady Touchdown were expected to go down on their knees with
her Ladyship, and say Amen to the prayers of either Doctor. During these
exercises old Touchdown, on account of his invalid condition, was allowed
to sit in his own room, and ave nexus and the paper read to him. Lady
Jane was the old Earl's favourite daughter, and tended him and loved lim
sincerely: as for Lady Emily, the dauntless of the  Waslerwoman of
Pinochle Common,'' her denunciation of future punishments (nt this period,
for her opinions modified afterwards) were so awful that they used to
frighten the timid old gentleman her father, and the physicians declared
his fits always occurred after one of her Ladyslip's sermons.
I will certainly call,'' said Lady Touchdown then, in reply to th
exhortation of her daughter's present, Mr. Pitt Crawley-' Who is
Miss Crawley's medical man''
Mr. Crawley mentioned the name of Mr. Cranmer.

however; and his change was only for the better: Creamer, my dear Pitt,

Pitt expressed his perfect aequicscence. He too had been carried along
by the energy of his noble kinswoman, and future mother-in-law. He
had been made to accept Saunders CeNtre, Luke Waters, Giles Jowls,
Power's Pills, Rodger's Pills, Pokey's Elixir, every one of her Ladyship's
remedies spiritual or temporal. He never left her house without carrying
respectfully away with him piles of her quack theology and medicine. O

she cannot convince by argument, bursts into tears, and the recusant finds
himself, at the end of the contest, taking down the bolus, and saying,

 And as for her spiritual state,'' continued the Lady, '` that of course

`Stop, my dear ladies,'' soil Pitt the diplomatic,  With every deference
to the opinion of my beloved and respected Lady Touchdown, I think it
would be quite unavailable to commence so early upon serious topics with
Miss Crawley. Remember her delicate condition, and how little, how very
little accustomed she has hitherto been to considerations connected with

`Can we then begin too early, Pitt%'' said Lady Emily, rising with six
little books already in her hand.
 If you begin abruptly, you will frighten her altogether. I know my
aunt's worldly nature so well as to be sure that any abrupt attempt at
conversion will be the very worst means that can be employed for the
welfare of that unfortunate lady. You will only frighten and annoy her.
She will very likely fling the books away, and refuse all acquaintance with
the givers.''
You are as worldly as MIss Crawley, Pitt,'' said Lady Emily, tossing
out of the room, her books in her hand.

 Of course, of course,'' Lady Touchdown remarked. ``Jane, my love,
you need not send that note to Mr. Irons. If her health is such that is-
cushions fatigue her, we will wait her amendment. I will call upon Miss
Crawley to-morrow,''
``And if I might suggest, my sweet lady,'' Pitt said in a bland tone,
`it would be as well not to take our precious Emily, who is too thus-
siastic; but rather that you should be accompanied by our sweet and dear
Lady Jane.''
``Most certainly, Emily would ruin everything,'' Lady Touchdown said;
and this time agreed to forego her usual practice, which was, as we have
said, before she bore down personally upon any individual whom she pro-
posed to subjugate, to fire in a quantity of tracts upon the menaced party;
(as a charge of the French was always preceded by a furious cannonale).
Lady Shutdown, we say, for the sake of the invalid's health, or for the
sake of her soul's ultimate welfare, or for the sake of her money, agreed to
terrorise.

Earl's coronet and the lozenge (upon which the three lambs trottant
argent upon the field art of the Touchdowns, were quartered with sable

Binkie), drove up in state to Miss Crawley's door, and the tall serious foot-
man handed in to Mr. Bowls her Ladyship's cards for Miss Crawley, and
one likewise for Miss Briggs. By way of compromise, Lady Emily sent in
a packet in the evening for the latter lady, containing copies of the

perusal; and a few for the servants' hall, viz. : `'Clubs from the Pantry;''

Miss Higgs, who was enabled
to speak a good word for the
latter, after the cards of the
Touchdown family had been pre-
rented to Miss Crawley. A
Countess's card left personally
too for her, Briggs, was not a
little pleasing to the poor friend-
less companion.  WHat could
LalySouthdownmean by leaving
a card upon to, I wonder, Miss Briggs ?'' said the republican Miss
Crawley ; upon which the companion meekly said ``that she hoped
there could be no harm in a lady of runk taking notice of a poor
gentleman,'' and she put away this card in her work-box amongst her
mest cherished personal treasures. Furthermore, Miss Briggs explained
how she had met Mr. Crawley walking with his cousin and long-affianeed
bride the day before: and she told how kind and gentle-looking the lady
was, and what a plain, not to say common, dress she had, all the articles
of which, from the bonnet down to the boots, she described and estimated
with female accuracy.
Miss Crawley allowed Briggs to rattle on without interrupting her to
much. As she got well, she was pining for society. Mr. Creamer, her
medical man, would not hear of her returning to her old haunts and display-
tion in London. The old spinster was too glad to find any companionship
at Brighton, and not only were the cards acknowledged the very next day,
but it Crawley ws graciously invited to come and see his aunt. He
came, bringing with him Lady Touchdown and her daughter. The dowager
did not say a word about the state of Miss Crawley's soul; but talked
with much discretion about the weather: about the war and the downfall
of the monster Bonaparte: and above all, about doctors, quacks, and the
particular merits of Dr. Rodgers, whom she then patronised.
During their interview Pitt Crawley made a great stroke, and one which
showed that, had his diplomatic career not been blighted by early neglect,
he might have risen to a high rank in his profession. When the Countess
Dowager of Touchdown fell foul of the Corsican upstart, as the fashion
was in those days, and showed that he was a monster stained with every

conceivable crime, a coward and a tyrant not fit to live, one whose fall was
predicted, &c., Pitt Crawley suddenly took up the cudgels in favour of the
an of Destiny. le described the First Consul as he saw him at Paris
at the Peace of Amiens; when he, Pitt Crawley, had the gratification of
making the acquaintance of the great and good Mr. Fox, a statesman
whom, however much he might differ with him, it was impossible not to
admire fervently-a statesman who had always had the highest opinion
of the eMperor Napoleon. And he spoke in terms of the strongest
indignation of the fruitless conduct of the allies towards this dethroned
monarch, who, after giving himself generously up to their mercy, as
consigned to an ignoble and cruel banishment, while a bigoted opisl
rabble was tyrannising over France in his stead.
This orthodox horror of Romish superstition saved Pitt Crawley in Lady
Touchdown's opinion, whilst his admiration for of and Napoleon raised
him immeasurably in Miss Crawley's eyes. Her friendship with that
defunct British statesman was mentioned when we first introduced her in
this history. A true Whig, Miss Crawley had been in opposition all
through the war, and though, to be sure, the downfall of the Emperor did
not very much agitate the old lady, or his ill-treatment tend to shorten
her life or natural rest, yet Pitt spoke to her heart when he lauded both
her idols; and by that single speech made immense progress in her favour.
`And what do you think, my dear'' Miss Crawley said to the young
lady, for whom she had taken a liking at first sight, as she always lid for
pretty and modest young people; though it must be owned her affections
cooled as rapidly as they rose.
Lady Jane brushed very much, and said ``that she did not understand
politics, which she left to wiser heads than cr's; but though Mamma was,
no doubt, correct, Mr. Crawley hal spoken beautifully.'' And when the
ladies were retiring at the conclusion of their visit, Miss Crawley hoped
` Lady Shutdown would be so kind as to send her Lady Jane sometimes, if
she could be spared to come down and console a poor sick lonely old
woman.'' This promise was graciously recorded, and they separated upon
great terms of amity.
`Don't let Lady Touchdown come again, Pitt,'' said the old lady.  She
is stupid and pompous like all your mother's family, whom I never could
endure. But bring that nice good-turned little Ludy lane as often as ever
you please.'' Pitt promised that he would do so. He did not tell the
Countess of Touchdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladysip,
who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most delightful and
majestic impression on Miss Crawley.
And so, nothing loth to comfort n sick lady, and perhaps not sorry in
her heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the
Reverend Bartholomew Irons, and the serious tondies who gathered round
the footstool of the pompous Countess, her mama, Lady Jane became a
pretty constant visitor to Miss Crawley, accompanied her in her drives, and
solace many of her evenings. She was so naturally good and soft, that
even Firkin was not jealous of her; and the gentle Briggs thought her
friend was less cruel to her, when kind Lady Jane was by, Towards her

Ladyship Miss Crawley's manners were charming. The old spinster told her
a thousand anecdotes about her outh, talking to her in a very different
strain from that in which she had been accustomed to converse with the
godless little Rebecca; for there was that in Lady Jane's innocence which
rendered light talking impertinence before her, and Miss Crawley was too
much of a gentleman to offend such purity. The young lady herself
had never received kindness except from this old spinster, and her brother
and father : and she repaid Miss Crawley's regiment by artless sweetness
anl friendship.
In the autumn evenings (when Rebecca was flannting at Paris, the
gamest among the gay conquerors there, and our Amelia, our dear wounded
Amelia, ahl where was sle ) Lady Jane would be sitting in Miss Crawley's
drawing-room singing sweetly to her, in the twilight, her little simple
songs and hymns, while the sun was setting and the sea was roaring on
the beach. The old spinster used to wake up when these ditties ceased,
and ask for more. As for Briggs, and the quantity of tears of happiness
which she now shed as she pretended to knit, and looked out at the
splendid ocean darling before the windows, and the lamps of heaven
beginning more brightly to shine-who, I say, can measure the happiness
and sensibility of Briggs'
Pitt meanwhile in the dining-room, with a pamphlet of the Corn Laws
or a Missionary Register by his side, took that kind of recreation which
suits romantic and romantic men after dinner. He sit Madeira : built
castles in the air: thought himself a fine fellow : felt himself much more
in love with Jane than he had been any time these seven years, during
which their liaison had lasted without the slightest impatience on Pitt's
part-and slept a good deal. When the time for coffee came, Mr. Bowls
used to enter in a noisy manner, and summon Squire Pitt, who would be
found in the dark very busy with his pamphlet.
I wish, my love, I could get somebody to play piquet with me,''
Miss Crawley said, one night, when this functionnry made his appearance
with the candles and the coffee. `Poor Briggs can no more play than an
owl, she is so stupid'' (the spinster always took an opportunity of abusing
Briggs before the servants) ; ``and I think I should sleep better if I had
my game.''
At this Lady Jane brushed to the tips of her little ears, and down to the
end of her pretty fingers; and when Mr. Bowls had quieted the room,
and the door was quite shut, she said:
Miss Crawley, I can play a little. I used to-to play a little with
poor dear papa.''
Come and kiss me. Come and kiss me this instant, you dear good
little soul,'' tried Mis Crawley in an ecstasy; and in this picturesque and
friendly occupation Mr. Pitt found the old Lady and the young one, when
he came up-stairs with his pamphlet in his hand. How she did blush all

shire and Sussex lie very close together, and Mrs. Bute had friends in the
latter county who took care to inform her of all, and a great deal more
than all, that passed ut Miss Crawley's house at Brighton. Pitt was there
more and more. He did not come for months together to the Ill, where
his abominable old father abandoned himself completely to run and water,
and the odious society of the Horrocks family. Pitt's success rendered
the Rector's family furious, and Mrs. Bute regretted more (though she
confessed less) than ever her monstrous fault in so insulting Miss bRiggs,
and in being so haughty and parsimonious to Bowls and Birkin, that
she had not a single person left in Miss Crawley's household to give her
information of what took place there.  It was all But's collar-bone,''
she persisted in saying; '` if that had not broke, I never would have left
her. I am a martyr to duty and to your odious electrical habit of

``Jim might go down and see her, certainly,'' the housewife said;
ndling, with a sigh, `` If we could but get one of the girls into the house;
but she could never endure them, because they are not pretty.'' Those
unfortunate and well-educated women made themselves heard from the
neighbouring drawing-room, where they were strumming away, with hard
fingers, an elaborate music-piece on the piano-forte, as their mother spoke;
and indeed they were at music, or at backboard, or at geography, or at
history, the whole day long. But what avail all these accomplishments, in

her hands; and Jim coming in from the stable at this minute, through
the parlour window, with a short pipe stuck in his oil-skin cap, he and his
father fell to talking about odds on the St. Leger, and the colloquy between
the Rector and his wife ended.
Mrs. But did not argue much good to the cause from the sending of
her son James as an ambussalexr, und saw him depart in rather a despairing
mood. Nor did the young fellow himself, when told what his mission was
to be, expect much pleasure or benefit from it; but he was consoled by
the thought that possibly tho oll lady would give him some handsome
remembrance of her, which would pay a few of his most pressing bills at
the commencement of the ensuing Oxford term, and so took his place by
the conch from Southampton, and was safely landed at Brighton on the same
evening, with his portmanteau, his favourite bull-dog Tower, and an
immense basket of farm and garden produce, from the denr lectory folks
to the year Miss Crawley. Considering it was too late to disturb the
invalid lady on the first night of his arrival, he put up at an inn, and
did not wait upon Miss Crawley until a late hour in the noon of next day.
James Crawley, when his aunt had Inst befell him, was a gawky land, at
that uncomfortable age when the voice varies between an unearthly treble
anda preternatural base; when the face not uncommonly looms out with
appearances for which Rowland's Waldorf is said to nct as a cure; when
boys are seen to shave friendly with their sister's scissors, and the sight
of other young women produces intolerable sensations of terror in them;
when the great hands and ankles protrude a long way from garments which
have grown too tight for them; when their presence after dinner is at once
frightful to the ladies, who are whispering in the twilight in the drawing-
room, und inexpressibly odious to the gentlemen over the mahogany, who
are restrained from freedom of intercourse and delightful interchange of
it by the presence of that gawky innocence; when, at the conclusion of
the second glass, papas say, ``lack, my boy, go out and see if the evening
holds up,'' and the youth, willing to be free, yet hurt at not being yet a
man, quits the incomplete banquet. James, then a hobbadehoy, was now
become a young man, having had the benefits of a university education,
and required the estimable polish, which is gained by living in a fast set
at a small college, and contracting debts, and being rusticated, and being
plucked.
He was  handsome lad, however, when he came to present himself to
his aunt at Brighton, and good looks were always a title to the fekle old
lady's favour. Nor did his bushes and awkwardness take away from it:
she was pleased with these healthy tokens of the young gentleman's
ingenuousness.
He said `he had come down for a couple of days to see a man of his
college, and-and to pay my respects to you, I'am, and my father's and
mother's, who hope you are well.''
Pitt was in the room with Miss Crawley when the lad was announced,
and looked very blank when his he was mentioned. The old lady had
plenty of humour, and enjoyed her correct nephew's perplexity. She
asked after all the people at the Rectory with great interest ; and said she
was thinking of paying them a visit. She praised the lead to his face, and

his sisters had not some of his good looks; and finding, on inquiry, that
he had taken up his quarters at an hotel, would not her of his stopping
there, but bale Mr. Bowls sent for Mr. James Crawley's things instantly;
``and hark ye, Bowls,'' she added, with great grciousness, ``you will
have the goodness to pay Mr. James's bill.''
She flung Pitt a look of arch triumph, which caused that diplomntist
almost to choke with envy. Much as he had ingratiated himself with his
aunt, she had never yet invited him to stay under her roof, and here was
a young whipper-snapper, who at first sight was made welcome there.
I beg your pardon, Sir,'' says BOwls, advancing with a profound
bow; ``what hotel, Sir, shall Thomas fetch the luggage from P''
O, dam,'' said young James, starting up, as if in some nlarn,
I'I go.''
e What I'' said Miss Crawley.
The Tom Crib's Arms,'' said James, blushing deeply.
Miss Crawley burst out laughing at this title. Mr. Bowls gare one
abrupt guffaw, as a confidential servant of the family, but choked the rest
of the valley; the diplomntist only smiled.
I-I didn't know any better,'' said James, looking down.  I'veneer
been here before; it was the cochrane told me.'' The young story-
teller1 The fact is, that on the Southampton coach, the day previous,
James Crawley had met the Tubular Pet, who was coming to Brighton to
make a match with the Rottingdean Fiber; and enchanted by the eu's
conversation, had passed the evening in company with that scientific man
and his friends, at the inn in question.
I-I'd best go and settle the score,'' James continued. "Could'I
think of asking you, Ma'am,'' he added, generously.
This delicacy made his sunt laugh the more.
Go and settle the bill, Bowls,'' she said, with a wave of her hand,
` and bring it to me,''
Poor lady, she did not know what she had done tHere-there'ssa
little da,'' suid James, looking frightfully guilty. I'd best go for him.
He bites footmen's calves.''
All the party cried out with laughing at this description; even Briggs
and Lady Jane, who was sitting mute during the interview between Miss
Crawley and her nephew; and Bowls, without a word, quieted the room.
Still, by way of punishing her elder nephew, Miss Crawley persisted in
being gracious to the young Bosnian. There were no limits to her kind-
ness or her compliments when they once began. She told Pitt he might
come to dinner, and insisted that James should accompany her in her drive,
and paraded him solemnly up and down the clip, on the back seat of the
barouche. During all this excursion, she condescended to say civil things
to him: she quoted Italian and French poetry to the poor bewildered
lad, and persisted that he was a fine scholar, and was perfectly sure he
would guin a gold medal, and be a Senior Wrangler.
: Haw, haw,'' laughed James, encouraged by these compliments,;
 Senior Wrangler, indeed; that 's at the other shop.''
What is the other shop, my dear child P'' said the lady.
304
VANITY AIR.
Senior Wranglers at Cambridge, not Oxford,'' sail the scholar, with
knowing air; and would probably have been more confidential, but that
suddenly there appeared on the cliff' in a tax-cart, drawn by a bang-p per.
dressel in white flannel coats, with mother-of-pearl buttons, his friends
the Tubular Pet and the Rottinglean Fiber, with three other gentlemen
of their acquaintance, who all saluted poor James there in the carriage as
he sate. This incident damped the ingenuous youth's spirits, and no word
of year or nay could he be induced to utter during the rest of the drive.
On his return he found his room prepared, and his portmanteau ready,
and might have remarked that MIr, Bowls's countenanee, when the latter
conducted him to his apartment, wore a look of gravity, wonder, and
compassion. But the thought of Mr. Bowls did not enter his head. He
was deploying the dreadful predicament in which he found himself, in a
house full of old women, jabbering French and Italian, aul talking poetry
to him. ` Regularly up a tree, by jingol'' exclaimed the molest boy, who
could not face the gentlest of her sex-not even Briggs-when she began
to talk to him ; whereas, put him at Bailey Lock, and he could out-slang
the boldest baseman.
At dinner, James appeared choking in a white neckcloth, and had the
honour of handling my Lady Jane down stairs, while Briggs and Mr.
Crawley followed afterwards, conducting the old lady, with her apparatus
of bundles, and shawls, aud cushions. Half of Briggs's tie at dinner
was spent in supcrintending the invalid's comfort, and in cutting up
chicken for her fat spaniel. James didnot talk much, but le ade a point
of asking all the ladies to drink wine, and accepted MIr. Crawley's chal-
lange, and consumed the greater part of a bottle of champagne which Mr,
Bowls was ordered to produce in his honour. The ladies having with-
drawn, and the two cousins being left together, Pitt, the ex-diplomatic,
became very communicative and friendly. He asked after James's career
at college-what his prospects in life were-hopes heartily he would get
on: and, in a word, was frank and amiable. James's tongue enclosed
with the Port, and he told his cousin his life, his prospects, his debts, his
troubles at the little-go, and his rows with the proctors, filling rapidly
from the bottles before in, and flying from Port to Madeira with joyous
activity.
 The chief pleasure which my aunt has,'' said Mr. Crawley, flying his
glass, ``is that people should do as they like in her house. This is Liberty
HIll, James, and you can't do Miss Crawley a greater kindness plan to do
s you please, and ask for what you will. I know you have all sneered at
me in the country for being a or. Miss Crawley is liberal enough to
suit any fancy. She is a Republican in principle, and despises everything
like rank or title.''
Why are you going to marry an Earl's daughter ?'' said James.
My denr friend, remember it is not poor Lady Jane's fault that she is
well born,'' Pitt replied with a costly air.  She cannot help being a
late. Besides, I am a Tory, you know.''

absurdity,-'` you don't care about a dawn or a rat; it's all nonsense.
I'm best if I think you know the difference between a dog and a luck.''
No; by the way,'' Pitt continued with increased blaniness, ``it was
about blood you were talking, and the personal advantages which people
derive from patrician birth. Here's the fresh bottle.''
 Blood's the world,'' sail James, gulping the ruby fluid down. `Nothing

``Come, come,'' said James, putting his hand to his nose nl winking
at his cousin with a pair of venous eyes, `` no jokes, old boy; no trying it
out on me. you want to trot me out, but it'no go. In vino veritas, old

an immense flourish of his glass.
At the lectory, when the battle of port wine was opened after dinner, the
young ladies had each a glass from a bottle of current wine. Mrs. Bute
took one glass of port, honest James had a couple commonly, but as his
father grew very sulky if e made further inroads on the bottle, the good
lad generally refrained from trying for more, and subsided either into the
current wine, or to some private gin-and-water in the stables, which he
enjoyed in the company of the coachmau and his pipe. At Oxford, the
quantity of wine was unlimited, but the quality was interior : but when
quantity and quality united, as at his aunt's house, James slowed that he

could appreciate them indeed; and hardly needed any of his cousin's
encouragement in draining of the second bottle supplied by MIr. Bowls.
When the time for coffee came, however, and for a return to the ladies,
of whom he stood in are, the young gentleman's agreeable frankness left
him, and he relapsed into his usual surly timidity: contenting himself by
saying yes and no, by scowling at LAdy Jane, and by upsetting one cup of
coffee during the evening.
If he did not speak he yawned in a pitiable manner, and his presence
threw a damp upon the modest proceedings of the evening, for Miss
Crawley and Lady Jane at their piquet, and Miss Briggs at her work, felt
that his eyes were wildly fixed on then, and were uneasy under that
audlin look.
He seems a very silent, awkward, bashful lad,'' said Miss Crawley to
Mr. Pitt.
He is more cormunicative in men's society than with ladies,'' Machia-
vel dryly replied: perhaps rather disappointed that the port wine had not
made lIn speak more.,
IIe had spent the early part of the next morning in writing home to
his mother a ost flourishing account of his reception by Miss Crawley.
But all he little knew what evils the day was bringing for him, and how
short his reign of favour was destined to be. A circumstance which Jim
had forgotten-a trivial but fatal circumstance-had taken place at the
Crib's Are on the night before le hal come to his aunt's house. It
was no other than this-Jim, who was always of a generous disposition,
and when in his cups especially hospitable, had in the course of the night
treated the Tubular champion and the Roltingdean man, and their friends,
twice or thrice to the refreshment of in-and-water-to that no less than
eighteen glasses of that fluid at eight-pence per glass were charged in
MIr. James Crawley's bill. It was not the amount of eight-pence, but
the quantity of gin which told fatally against poor James's character, when
his aunt's butler, Mr. Bowls, went down at his mistress's request to pay
the young gentleman's bill. The landlord, fearing lest the country should
be refused altogether, swore solemnly that the young gent had consumed
personally every farthing's worth of the liquor: and Bowls paid the bill
finally, and showed it on his return home to MIrs. Firkin, who was
shocked at the frightful prodigality of in; and took the bill to Miss
Briggs as accountant-general; who thought it her duty to mention the
circumstance to her principal, Miss Crawley.
HAd he drunk a dozen bottles of claret the old spinster could hare
pardoned him. Mr. Fox and MIr. Sheridan drank claret. Gentlemen
drank claret. But eighteen glasses of gin consumed among boxers in an
ignoble pot-house-it was an odious crime and not to be pardoned readily.
Everything went against the lad: e came home pertumed from the
stables, whether he had been to pay his dog Tower a visit-and whence
he was going to take his friend out for an airing, when he met Miss Crawley
and her where Blenheim spanicl, which Tower would have eaten up
ld not the Blenheim fled squealing to the protection of Miss Briggs,
while the atrocious master of the bull-dog stood laughing at the horrible
persecution.

A NOVEL ABOUT A HERO.

This day to the unlucky oy's modesty had likewise forsaken him.
IIe was lively and faecetious at dinner. During the repast he levelled one
or two jokes against Pitt Crawley: he drank as much wine as upon the
previous day : and going quite unsuspiciously to the drawing-room began
to entertain the ladies there with some choice Oxford stories. IIe described
the different pugilistie qualities of Molyneus anl Dutch Sam, offered
playfully to give Lady Jane the odds upon the Tubular Pet against the
Rottingdean man, or take them, as her Lalyship chose: and crowned thc
plecnsntry by proposing to back himself against his cousin Pitt Crawley,
either with or without the gloves. `And that 's a fair offer, my back,'' he
said, with a loud laugh, slapping Pitt on the shoulder, ``and my father
told me to make it too, and he'll go elves in the bet, ha hal'' As
saying, the engaging youth nodded knowingly at poor MIss Briggs, and
pointed his thumb over his shoulder at PItt Crawley in a jocular and
exulting manner.
Pitt was not pleased altogether perhaps, but still not unhappy in th
ain. Poor Jim had his laugh out : and staggered neross the room with
his aunt's candle, when the old lady moved to retire, and offered to salut.

stairs to his bel-room perfectly satisfied with himself, and with a pleased
notion that his aunt's money would be left to him in preference to his
father and all the rest of his family.

blowing inwards and a five thorough draft being established, the clouds of

That pipe of tobacco finished the business: and the Bute-Crawleys
never knew how many thousand pound it cost them. Firkin rushed down-
stairs to Bowls who was reading out the `` Fire and the Frying Pan'' to
his aide-de-camp in a loud and ghostly voice. The dreadful secret was
told to him by Firkin with so frightened a look, that for the first moment
Mr. Bowls and his young man thought that flowers were in the house

Crawley's bed. When made aware of the fact however-to rush up-stairs

beard which he was so anxiously expecting, handed a note into Mr. James
in bed, in the handwriting of Miss Briggs.
` Dear Sir,'' it said, `` Miss Crawley has passed an exceedingly dia
turned night, owing to the shocking manner in which the house has been
polluted by tobacco; Miss Crawley bids me say she regrets that she is too
unwell to see you before you go-and above all, that she ever induced yon
to remove from the ale-house, where she is sure you will be much more
comfortable during the rest of your stay at Brighton.''
And herewith honest James's career as a candidate for his aunt's four
ended. He Had in fact, and without knowing it, done what he menaeed
to do. He has fought his cousin Pitt with the gloves.

after Waterloo, and were passing the winter of 1815 at Paris in great
splendour and gaiety. Greece was a good economist, and the price
poor Jos Sedley had paid for her two horses was in itself sufficient to
keep their little establishment afloat for a year, at the least; there was no
occasion to turn into money `` my pistols, the sme which I shot Captain
Marker,'' or the gold dressing-case, or the cloak lined with sable. Becky
had it made into a premise for israel, in which she rode in the Bois de
Boulogne to the admiration of all: and you should have seen the scene
between her and her delighted husband, whom she rejoined after the army
had entered Cnmbray, and when she ushered herself, and let out of her dress
all those watches, knick-knacks, bank-notes, checks, and valuables, which
she had secreted in the wedding, previous to hcr editated flight from
Brussels Tufto was charmed, and Rawdon ronrel with delightful
laughter, and swore that she was better than any play he eer sun, by
Jove. And the way in which she joined Jos, and which she described
with infinite fur, carried up his delight to a pitch of quite insane death-
siam. He believed in his wife as much as the French soldiers in
Napoleon.
Her success in Paris was remarkable. All the French ladies noted her
charming. She spoke their language admirably. She adopted at once
their grace, their liveliness, their manner. Her husband was stupid cer-
mainly-all English are stupid-and, besides, a dull husband at Paris is
always a point in a lady's favour. He was the heir of the rich and
spiritelle Miss Crawley, whose house had been open to so many of the
French nobles during the emigration. They received the Colonel's wife
in their own hotels- Why,'' wrote a great lady to Miss Crawley, who had
bought her place and trinkets at the Duchess's own price, and given her
many a dinner during the pinching times after the Revolution--v WAy

Tuileries, and we are all jealous of the attention which Monsieur pays her.
If you could have seen the site of a certain stupid Milali Breaches,
(whose eagle-beak and toque and feathers may be seen peering over the
heads of all assemblies) when Madame, the Duchess of AngoulEme, the
august daughter and companion of kings, desired especially to be presented
to Mrs. Crawley, as your dear daughter and protege, and thanked her in the
name of France, for all your benevolence towards our unfortunate during

her speak of you, her protectress, her mother, would bring tears to the eyes
of ores. How she does you how we all love our admirable, our respect-
able Miss Crawley1''
It is to be feared that this letter of the Parisian great lady did not by
any means advance Mre. Becky's interest with her admirable, her respect-
able, relative. On the contrary, the fury of the old spinster was beyond
bounds, when she found what was Rebecca's situation, and how auda-

vicious she had made use of Miss Crawley's name, to get an entree into
Parisian society. Too much shaken in mind and body to compose a letter
in the French language in reply to that of her correspondent, she dictated
to Briggs a furious answer in her own native tongue, repudiating Mrs.
Rawdon Crawley altogether, and warning the public to beware of her as
a most artful and dangerous person. But as adame the Duchess of
N- had only been twenty years in England, she did not understand
single word of the language, and contented herself by informing Mrs.
Rawlon Crawley at their next meeting, that she had received a charing
letter from that care lIves, and that it was full of benevolent things for
MIrs. Crawley, who began seriously to he hopes that the spinster would
relent.
Meanwhile, she was the gamest and most admired of Englishwomen: and
had a little European congress on her reception-night-Prussians and Cos-
sacks, spaniards and English-all the world was at Paris during this famous
winter: to lace seen the stars and cordons in Rebecca's humble saloon

there were parties every day at Very's or Beauillicrs'; play was plentiful
and his luck good. Tufto perhaps was sulky. MIrs. Tufto hid come
over to Paris at her own invitation, and besides this contexts, there
were a score of generals now round Becky's chair, and she might take her
choice of a dozen bouquets when she went to the play. Lady Breaches
and the chiefs of the English society, stupid and irreproachable females,
writhed with anguish at the success of the little upstart Becky, whose
poisoned jokes quivered and rankled in their chaste breasts. But she had
all the man on her side. Sle fought the women with indomitable courage,
and they could not talk scandal in any tongue but their own.
So in feites, pleasures, and prosperity, the winter of 1815-10 passed
away with MIrs. Rawdon Crawley, who accommodated herself to polite life
as if her ancestors had been people of fashion for centuries past-and
who from her wit, talent, and energy, indeed merited a place of honour
in Vanity Fair. In the early spring of 1816, Malignant's Journal con-
gained the following announcement in an interesting corner of the paper:
On the 26th of MInrch-the Lady of Lieutenant-Colonel Crawley, of the
Life Guards Green-of a son and heir,''
This event was copied into the London papers, out of which Miss
Briggs read the statement to Miss Crawley, at breakfast, at Brighton.
The intelligence, expected as it might have been, caused a crisis in the
affairs of the Crawley family. The spinster's rage ose to its height,
and sending instantly for Pitt, her nephew, and for the Body Touchdown,
from Brunswick Square, she requested an immediate celebration of the
marriage which had been so long pending between the two families.
And she announced that it was her intention to allow the young couple a
thousand a year during her lifetime, at the expiration of which the bulk
of her property would be settled upon her nephew and her der niece,
Lady Jane Crawley. Waxy came down to ratify the deeds-Lord
A NoVEL WITHOUT A PIERO.
311
Touchdown gave away his sister-she was married by a Bishop, and not
by the Rev. Bartholomew Irons-to the disappointment of the irregular
prelate.
When they were married-Pitt would have liked to take a wheel tour
with his bride, as became people of their condition. But the affection of
the old lady towards Lady are lad grown so strong, that she fairly
owned she could not part with her favourite. Pitt and his wife came
therefore, and lived with Miss Crawley: and (greatly to the annoyance of

whole family-Pitt, Lady Due, Miss Crawley, riggs, Bowls, Firkin, and

dismissed Creamer, she installed Rodgers, and soon stripped Miss Crawley
of even the semblance of authority. The poor soul grew so tamil that

HE news of the great fights ol
uatre Bras and Waterloo
reached England at the same
time. The Gazette first pub-
listed the result of the two
battles; at which glorious in-
intelligence all England thrilled
with triumph and fear. Par-
circular then followed; and
after the announcement of the
victories came the list of the
wounded and the slain. Who
can tell the dread with which
that catalogue was opened and
rend. Fancy, at every village
and homestead almost through
the three kingdoms, the great
news coming of the battles of
Flanders, and the feelings of exaltation and gratitude, bereavement and
sickening;g dismay, when the lists of the regimental losses were gone
through, and it became know whether the dear friend and relative
had escaped or had fallen. Anybody who will take the trouble of
looking back to a file of the newspapers of the time, must, even now,
feel at second-hand this breathless pause of expectation. The list of
casualties are carried on from day to day: you stop in the midst as in a
story wichl is to be continued in our next. Think what the feelings must
have been as those papers followed inch other fresh from the press; and if
such an interest could be felt in our country, and about a battle where but
twenty thousand of our people were engaged, think of the condition of
Europe for twenty years before, where people were fighting, not by thou-
sands, but by millions; each one of whom as e struck his enemy wounded
horribly some other innocent heart far away.
The news which that famous Gazette brought to the Osborne gare a
dreadful shock to the family and its chief. The girls indulged unrestrained
in their grief. The gloom-stricken old father was still more borne down
by his fate and sorrow. He strove to think that a judgment was on the
boy for his disobedience. He lured not own that the severity of the
sentence frightened him, and that its fulfilment had come too soon upon
his curses. Sometimes a shuddering terror struck him, as if he had been
the author of the doom which he had called down on his son. There was

n chance before of reconciliation. The boy's wife might have died; or he
might have come back and sin, Father I have sinned. But there was no
hope now. He stood on the other side of the gulf impassable, haunting
lis parent with sad eyes. He remembered them once before so in a fear,
when every one thought the lad was dying, and e lay on his bed speech-
less, and gazing with a dreadful gloom. Good God how the father clung
to the doctor then; and with what s sickening anxiety he followed him:
what a weight of grief was off his mind when, after the crisis of the fear,
the lad recovered, and looked nt his father once more with eyes that recog-
sized him. But now there was no help or cure, or chance of reconcile-
ment: above all, there were no humble words to soothe vanity outraged
and furious, or bring to its natural flow the poisoned, angry blood. And
it is hard to say which pang it was more the proud father's heart most
keenly-that his son should have gone out of the french of his forgive-
ness, or that the apology which his own pride expected should have
escaped him.
WHatever his sensations might have been, however, the stern old man
would have no confidant. He never mentioned his son's name to his
daughters ; but ordered the elder to place all the females of the establish-
ment in mourning; and desired that the male servants should be similarly
anttired in deep black. All parties and entertainments, of course, were to
be put off. No communications were made to his future son-in-law, whose
marriage-day had been fixed; but there was enough in MIr. Osborne's
appearance to prevent Mr. Bullock from making any inquiries, or in any
way pressing forward that ceremony. IIe and the ladies whispered about
it under their voices in the drawing-room sometimes, whither the father
never came. He remained constantly in his own study; the whole front
part of the house being closed until some time after the completion of the
general mourning.
About three weeks after the 18th of June, Mr. Osborne's acquaintance,
Sir William Dobbin, called at Mr. Osborne's house in Russell square, with
a very pale and agitated face, and insisted upon seeing that gentleman.
Ushered into his room, and after a few words, which neither the speaker
for the host understood, the former produced from an enclosure a letter
sealed with a large red seal.  My son, Major Dobbin,'' the Alderman
said, with some hesitation, `` dispatched me a letter by an officer of the
--th, who arrived in town to-any. My son's letter contains one for you,
Osborne.'' The Alderman placed the letter on the table, and Osborne
stared at him for a moment or two in silence. His looks frightened the
ambassador, who, after looking guilty for a little time at the grief-stricken
man, hurried away without a farther word.
The letter was in George's well-known bold hand-writing. It was that
one which he had written before day-break on the 16th of June, and just
before he took lead of Amelia. The great red seal was emblazoned with
the sham coat of arms which Osborne had assumed from the Peerage, with
Pax in bello'' for a motto; that of the ducal house with which the vain
old man tried to fancy himself connected. The hand that signed it would
never hold pen or sword more. The very seal that sealed it had been
robbed from George's dead body as it lay on the field of battle. The

father knew nothing of this, but out and looked at the letter in terrified
vacancy. He almost fell when he went to open it.

What dark, cruel comments upon Life and Vanitiesl Most of us have
got or written drawers full of them. They are closet-skeletons which we
keep and shun. Osborne trembled long, before the letter from his dead son.
The poor boy's letter did not say much. He had been too proud to
acknowledge the tenderness which his heart felt. He only said, that on
the eve of a great bottle, e wished to bid his father farewell, and solemuly
to implore his good offices for the wife-it might be for the child-whom
he 1left behind him. He owned with contrition that his irregularities and
extravagance had already wasted a large part of his mother's little fortune.
He thanked lis father for his former generous conduct; and he promised
him, that if he fell on the field or survived it, he would act in a manner
worthy of the name of George Osborne.
IIis English habit, pride, awkwardness perhaps, had prevented him
from saying more. Iis father could not see the kiss George had placed on
the superscription of his letter. MIr. Osborne dropped it with the bitterest,
lcndliest ping of balked affection and revenge. His son was still beloved
and unforgiven.
About two months afterwards however, as the young ladies of the
family went to church with their father, they remarked how he took a
different seat from that which he usually occupied when he chose to
attend divine worship; and that from his cushion opposite, he looked up
at the wall over their heads. This caused the young women likewise
to gaze in the direction towards which the father's gloomy eyes pointed:
and they saw an elaborate monument upon the wall, where Britannia was
represented weeping over an urn, and a broken sword, and a cochrane
lion, indicated that the piece of sculpture had been erected in honour of a
deceased warrior. The sculptors of those days had stocks of such funerenl
emblems in and; as you may see still on the walls of St. Paul's, which
are covered with hundreds of these braggart heathen allegories. There
was a constant demand for them during the first fifteen years of the
present century.
Under the memorial in question were emblazoned the well known and
pompous Osborne arms; and the inscription said, that the monument was
Sacred to the memory of George Oborne, Junior, sq., late a Captain
in his Majesty's -th regiment of foot, who fell on the l8th of June, 1815,
aged 28 years, while fighting for his king and country in the glorious
victory of Waterloo. Dulce et decorum est pro patrid mori,''
The sight of that stone agitated the nerves of the sisters so much, that
Miss Maria was compelled to leave the church. The congregation made
way respectfully for those sowing girls clothed in deep black, and pitied

 Will he forgive Mrs. George'' the girls said to themselves as soon as
their ebullition of grief was over. Much conversation passed too among

the acquaintances of the Osborne family, who knew of the rupture between
the son and father caused by the former's marriage, s to the chance of a
reconciliation with the young widow. There were acts along the
gentlemen both about Russell Square and in the City.
If the sisters had any anxiety regarding the possible recognition of
Amelia as a daughter of the family, it was increased presently, and towards
the end of the autumn, by their father's announcement that he was going
abroad. He did not say hitler, but they knew at once that his steps
would be turned towards Belgium, and were aware that George's widow
was still in Brussels. Tley had pretty accurate news indeed of poor
Amelia from Lly Dobbin and her daughters. Our honest Captain had
been promoted in consequence of the death of the second mAjor of the
regiment on the field; and the brave O'Dowd, who had distinguished
himself greatly here as upon all occasions where he had a chance to show
his coolness and valour, was a Colonel and Companion of the Bath.
Very many of the brae -th, who had suffered severely upon both days
of action, were still at Brussels in the autumn, recovering of their wounds.
The city was a vast military hospital for months after the great battles;
and as new and officers began to rally from their hurts, the .gardens and
places of public resort swarmed with maimed warriors old and young,
who, just revenue out of death, fell to gambling, and gaiety, and love-
making, as people of Vanity Fair will do. Mr. Osborne found out some
of the -th easily. He knew their uniform quite well, and had been
used to follow all the promotions and exchanges in the regiment, and
loved to talk about it and its officers as if he had been one of the number.
On the day after his arrival at Brussels, and as he issued from his hotel,
which faced the park, he saw a soldier in the well-known facings, reposing
on a stone-bench in the garden, and went and sat down trembling by the
wounded convalescent man.
wEre you in Captain Osborne's company'' he said, and added, after
a pause, "`he was my son, Sir,''
The man was not of the Captain's company, but he lifted up his
unwoundel arm and touched his cap sadly and respectfully to the haggard
broken-spirited gentleman who questioned him. ` The whole army didn't
contain a finer or a better officer,'' the soldier said. :The sergeant of
the Captain's company (Captain Raymond had it now), was in town
though, and was just well of a shot in the shoulder. His honour might
see him if he liked, who could tell him anything he wanted to know about
-about the -'s actions. But his honour had seen Major Dobbin no
doubt, the brave Captain's great friend; and Mrs. Osborne, who was
here too, and had been very bad, he heard everybody say. They say she
was out of her mind like for six weeks or more. But your honour knows
all about that-and asking your pardon ''-the man added.
Osborne put a guinea into the soldier's hand, and told him he should
have another if he would bring the sergeant to the HOtel du Pare;: a
promise which very soon brought the desired officer to MIr. Osborne's
presence. And the first soldier went away; and after telling a comrade
or two how Captain Osborne's father was arrived, and what a free-handed
generous gentleman he was, they went and made good cheer with drink

VANITY AIR.
and feasting, as long as the guineas lasted which had come from the proud
purse of the mourning old father.
In the Serpent's company, who was also just convalescent, Osborne
made the journey of Waterloo and autre Bras, a journey which
thousands of his countrymen were then taking. He took the Sergeant
with him in his carriage, and went through both fields under his guidance.
He saw the point of the road where the regiment marched into action
on the 16th, and the slope down which they drove the French cavalry
who were pressing on the retreating Belgians. There was the spot where
the noble Captain cut down the French officer who was grappling with the
young Ensign for the colours, the Colour-Sergeants having been shot
down. Along this road they retreated on the next day, and here was the
bank at which the regiment bivouaeked under the rain of the night of the
seventeenth. Further on was the position which they took and held during
the day, forming time after time to receive the charge of the enemy's
horsemen, and lying down under shelter of the bank from the furious
fRench cannonade. And it was at this declivity when at evening the
whole English line received the order to advance, as the enemy fell back
after his lnt charge, that the Captain hurraying and rushing down the
hill waving his sword, received a shot and fuelled. `` It was Major Dobbin
who took back the Captain's body to Brussels,'' the Sergeant said, in a
low voice, ``and had him buried, as your HOnour knows,'' The peasants
and relic-hunters about the place were screaming round the pair, as the
soldier told his story, offering for sale all sorts of mementoes of the fight,
crosses, and epaulets, and shattered cuirasses, and eagles.
Osborne gave a sumptuous reward to the Sergeant when he parted with
him, after having visited the scenes of his son's lust exploits. His burial
place he had already seen. Indeed he had driven thither immediately
after his arrival at Brussels. George's body lay in the pretty burial-
ground of Linked, near the city ; in which place, having once visited it on
a party of pleasure, he had lightly expressed a wish to have his grave
male. And there the young officer was laid by his friend, in the union-
serrated corner of the garden, separated by a little hedge from the temples
and towns and plantations of flowers and shrubs, under which the Roman
Catholic lead repose. It seemed a humiliation to old Osborne to think
that his son, an eNglish gentleman, a Captain in the famous British army,
should not be found worthy to lie in ground where mere foreigners were
buried. WHich of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our
warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is Old Osborne
did not speculate much upon the mingled nature of his feelings, and how
his instinct and selfishness were combating together. He firmly believed
that everything he did was right, that he ought on all occasions to have
his own way-and like the sting of a wasp or serpent his hatred rushed
out armed and poisonous against anything like opposition. He was
proud of his hatred as of everything else. Always to be right, always to
trample forward, and never to doubt, are not these the great qualities with
which dullness takes the lead in the world

gates of the city at sunset, they met another open barouche, in which

were a couple of ladies and a gentleman, and by the side of which an
officer was riding. Osborne gave a start back, and the Sergeant, seated
with him cast a look of surprise at his neighbour, as he touched his cap
to the officer, who mechanically returned his salute. It was Amelia, with
the lamo young Ensign by her side, and opposite to her her faithful friend
Mrs. O'Dowd. It was Amelia, but how change from the fresh nd
comely girl Osborne knew. Her face was white and thin. ler pretty
brown hair was parted under a widow's cap-the poor child. ller eyes
were fixed, and looking nowhere. They stared blank in the face of
Osborne, as the carriages crossed each other, but she did not know him;
nor did he recognise her, until looking up, he saw bDobbin riding by her,
and then he knew who it was. He hated her. He did not know how
much until he saw her there. When her carriage had passed on, he
turned and stared at the Sergeant, with a curse and defiance in his eye,
cast at his companion, who could not help looking at him-as much
as to say. `` How dare to look at me Damn you: I do hate her.
It is she who has tumbled my hopes and all my pride down.''  Tall
the scoundrel to drive on quick,'' he shouted with an oath, to the lackey
on the box. A minute afterwards, a horse came clattering over the pave-
ment behind Osborne's carriage, and Dobbin rode up. His thoughts had
been elsewhere as the carriages passed each other, and it was not until he
had ridden some paces forward that he remembered it was Osborne who
had just passed him. Then he turned to examine if the sight of her
father-in-law had made an impression on Amelia, but the poor girl did
not know who had passed. Then William, who daily used to accompany
her in his drives, taking out his watch, made some excuse about an
engagement which he suddenly recolleeted, and so rode of. She did not
remark that either: but sate looking before her, over the homely landscape
towards the woods in the distance, by which George marched away.
Mr. Osborne, Mr. Osborne'' series Dobbin, as he rode up and held
out his hand. Osborne made no motion to take it, but shouted out once
more and with another curse to his servant to drive on.
Dobbin laid his hand on the carriage side. I will see you, Sir,'' he
said. ``I have a message for you.''
From that woman P'' soil Osborne, fiercely.
No,'' replied the other, ``from your son;'' at which Osborne fell back
into the corner of his carriage, and Dobbin allowing it to pass on, rode
close behind it, and so through the town until they reached Mr. Osborne's
hotel, and without a word. There he followed Osborne up to his apart-
ments. George had often been in the rooms; they were the lodgings
which the Crawleys had occupied during their stay in Brussels.
 Pray, have you any commands for me, Captain Dobbin, or, I cg
your pardon, I should sny Maior Dobbin, since better men than you are
dead, and you step into their shoes,'' said Mr. Osborne, in that sarcastic
tone which he sometimes was pleased to assume.
 Better men are dead,'' Dobbin replica. ' I want to speak to you
about one.''

I am here as his closest friend,'' the Major , resumed, ``and the
executor of his will. He made it before we went into action. Are you
aware how small his means are, and of the threatened circumstances of

I don't know his widow, Sir,'' Osborne said. `Let her go back to
her father,'' But the gentleman whom he addressed was determined to
remain in good temper, and went on without ceding the interruption.
 Do you know, Sir, Mrs. Oborne's condition Her life and her
reason almost have been shaken by the blow which has fallen on her. It
is very doubtful whether she will rally. There is a chance left for her
however, and it is about this I came to speak to you. She will be a
mother soon. Will you visit the parent's offence upon the child's head:
or will you forgive the child for poor George's sukeP''
Osborne broke out into a rhapsody of self-praise and precautions. By
the first, excusing himself to his own conscience for his conduct; by the
second, exaggerating the undutifulucess of George. No father in all
England could have behaved more generously to a son, who had rebelled
against him wickedly. IIe had died without even so much as confessing
he was rong. Let him take the consequences of his undutifulness and
folly. As for himself, Mr. Osborne, he was a man of his word. He
had sworn never to speak to that women or to recognise er as his son's
wife.  And that's what you may tell her,'' he concluded with an oath;
`'and that 's what I will stick to to the last day of my life.''
There was no hope from that quarter then. The widow ust lie on
her slender pittancce, or on such aid ss Jos could give her. I might tell
her, and she would not heed it,'' thought Dobbin sadly: for the poor
girl's thoughts were not lere nt nll since her catastrophe, and stupified
under the pressure of her sorrow, good and evil where like indifferent
to her. So, indeed, were even friendship and kindness. She received
them both uucomplainingly, und having accepted them, relapsed into
her grief.
suppose some twelve months after the above conversation took place
to have passed in the life of our poor Amelia. She has spent the first
portion of that time in a sorrow so profound and pitiable, that we who
have been watching and describing some of the emotions of that weak
and tender heart, must draw back in the presence of the cruel grief under
which it is bleeding. Tread silently round the hapless couch of the poor
prostrate soul. Shut gently the door of the dark chamber, wherein she
suffers, as those kind people did who nursed her through the first months
of her pain, and never left her until heaven had sent her consolation. A
day came-of almost terrified delight and wonder-when the poor widowed
girl pressed a child upon her breast,-a child, with the eyes of George
who was gone-a little boy, as beautiful as a cherub. What a miracle it
was to hear its first cry1 How she laughed and went over it-how love,
and hope, and prayer woke again in her bosom as the baby nestled there.
She was safe. The doctors who attended her, and had feared for her Life
or for her brain, ad waited anxiously for this crisis before they could
pronounce that either was secure. It was worth the long months of doubt

and lead which the persons, who had constantly been with her, had
passed, to see her eyes once more beaming tenderly upon them.
Our friend Dobbin was one of them. It was he who brought her back
to England and to her mother's house; when Mrs. O'Dod, receiving a
peremptory summons from her Colonel, had been forced to quit her
patient. To be Dolbin holding the infant, and to hear Amelia's laugh of
triumph as she watched him, would have done any man good who had a
sense of humour. William was the godfather of the child, and exerted his
ingenuity in the purchase of cups, spoons, pap-boats, and corals for this
little Christin.
How his mother nursed him, and dressed him, and live upon him; low
she drove away all nurses, and would scarce allow any hand but her own
to touch him; how she considered that the greatest favour sle could
confer upon his godfather, Major Dobbin, was to allow the MAjor coca-
sionally to handle him, need not be told here. This child was her being.
TIer existence was a maternal cares. She enveloped the feeble and
unconscious creature with love and worship. It was her life which the
baby drank in from her bosom. Of nights, and when alone, she hal
stealthy and intense rapturcs of motherly loe, such as God's marvellous
care has awarded to the female distinct-joys how far higler anl lower
than reason-blind beautiful devotions which only women's hearts now.
It was William Dobbin's task to muse upon these moments of Aelia's,
and to watch her heart ; and if his love mde him divine almost all the
feelings which agitated it, alas l he could see with a fatal pcrspicuity that
there was no place there for lim. And so, gently, he bore lis fate, knowing
it, and content to bear it.
lI suppose Amelia's father and mother saw though the intentions of the
Major, and were not ill-disposed to encourage him; for Dobbin visited
their louse daily, and stayed for hours with them, or with Amelia, or with
the honest landlord, Mr. Clapp, and his family. He brought, on one
pretext or another, presents to everybody, and almost every day; and
went with the landlord's little girl who was rather a favourite with
Amelia, by the name of Major Sugarplums. It was this little child who
commonly acted as mistress of the ceremonies to introduce him to Irs.
Osborne. She laughed one day when Major Sugarplums' cab drove up to
Fulham, and he descended from it, bringing out a woolen lose, a drum,
a trumpet, and other warlike toys, for little Gcorgy, who was scarcely six
months old, and for whom the articles in question were entirely premature.
The child was asleep. `Hush,'' sid Amelia, annoyed, perhaps, at the
creaking of the Major's boots; and she held out her hand; smiling because
William could not take it until he had oil himself of his cargo of toys.
 Go down stairs, little Mary,'' said he presently to the child, 'I want to
speak to Mrs. Osborne.'' She looked up rather astonished, and laid down
the infant on its bed.
 I am come to say good-bye, Amelia,'' said he, taking ler slender little
white hand gently.
Good-bye?' and where are you going 2'' she said, with a smile.
`Send the letters to the agents,'' he said; `` they will forward them;
for you will write to e, won't you? I shall be way a long time.''

I'i write to you about Georgy,'' she said.  Dear William, how good
you have been to him and to do. Look at him Isn't he like an angel
The little pink hands of the child closed mechanically round the honest
soldier's finger, and Amelia looked up in his face with bright maternal
pleasure. The cruellest looks could not have wounded him more than that
glance of hopeless kindness. He went over the child and mother. He
could not speak for a moment. And it was with all his strength that he
could force himself to say a God bless you. ``Gol bless you,'' said Amelia,
aul held up her face and kissed him.
Hush.l Dont wake Georgy I'' she added, as William Dobbin went to
the door with heavy steps. She did not hear the noise of his cab-wheel
as he drove away: she was looking at the child, who was laughing in his
sleep.

Many a glass of wine have we all of us drunk, I have very little doubt,
hob-and-robbing with the hospitable giver, and wondering how the deuce
he paid for it.
Some three or four years after his stay in Paris, when Rawdon Crawley
and his wife were established in a very small comfortable house in Curzon
Street, Mayfair, there was scarcely one of the numerous friends whom they
entertained at dinner that did not ask the above question regarding them.
The novelist, it has been said before, knows everything, and as I am in
a situation to be able to tell the public how Crawley and his wife live
without any income, may I entreat the public newspapers which are in the
habit of extracting portions of the various periodical works now published,
not to reprint the following exact narrative and calculations-of which I
ought, as the discoverer, (and at some expense, too,) to have the benefit,
My son,-I would say, were I blessed with a child-you may by deep
inquiry and constant intercourse with him, learn how a man lies com-
notably on nothing a-year. But it is best not to be intimate with gentle-
men of this profession, and to take the calculations at second-and, as you
do logarithms, for to work them yourself, depend upon it, will cost you
something considerable.
On nothing per annum then, and during a course of some two or three
years, of which we can afoul to give but a very brief history, Crawley
and his wife lived very happily and comfortably at Paris. It was in this
period that he quieted the Guards, and sold out of the army. When we
find him again, his mustaehios and the title of Colonel on his card are the
only relics of his military profession.
It has been mentioned that Rebecca, soon after her arrival in Paris, took
a very smart and leading position in the society of that capital, and was
welcomed at some of the most distinguished houses of the restored French
nobility. The English men of fashion in Pris courted her, too, to the
disgust of the ladies their wives, who could not bear the revenue. For
some months the salons of the Faubourg St. Germain, in which her
place was secured, and the splendour of the new Court, where she was
received with such distinction, delighted, and perhaps a little intoxicated

to slight the people-honest young military men mostly,-who formed
her husband's chief society.
But the Colonel yawned sadly among the duchesses and great allies of
the Court. The old women who played east made such a noise about a
five-iran piece, that it was not worth Colonel Crawley's while to sit down
at a card-table. The wit of their conversation he could not appreciate,
being ignorant of their language. And what good could his wife get, he
urged, by making courses every night to a whole circle of Princesses
He left Rebecca presently to frequent these parties alone; resuming his
own simple pursuits and amusements amongst the amiable friends of his
own choice.

The truth is, when we say of a gentleman that he lives elegantly on nothing
a-year, we use the word '`nothing,'' to signify something unknown; mean-
ing, simply, that we don't know how the gentleman in question defray the
expenses of his establishment. Now, our friend the Colonel had a great
aptitude for all games of change: and exercising himself, s he continually
did, with the cards, the dice-box, or the cue, it is natural to suppose that
he attained a much greater skill in the use of these articles than men cana
possess who only occasionally handle them. To use a cue at billiards
well is like using a pencil, or a German flute, or a small-sword-you
cannot master any one of these implements at first, and it is only by
repeated study and perseverance, joined to a natural taste, that a man can
excel in the handling of either. Now Crawley, from being only a brilliant
amateur had grown to be a consummate master of billiards. Like a great
general, his genius used to rise with the danger, and when the luck had
been unfavourable to him for a whole game, and the bets were consequently
against him, he would, with consummate skill and boldness, make some
prodigious hits which would restore the battle, and come in a victory at the
end, to the astonishment of everybody-of everybody, that is, who was a
stranger to his play. Those who were accustomed to see it were cautious
how they staked their money against a man of such sudden resources, and
brilliant, and overpowering skill.

and making such blunders, that new comers were often inclined to think
manly of his talent; yet when roused to action, and awakened to
caution by repeated small losses, it was remarked that Crawley's play
became quite different, and that he was pretty sure of beating his enemy
thoroughly before the night was over. Indeed, very few men could say
that they ever had the better of him.
His successes were so repeated that no wonder the envious and the
vanquished spoke sometimes with bitterness regarding them. And as the
French say of the Duke of Wellington, who never suffered as defeat, that
only an astonishing series of lucky accidents enabled him to be an invasion
able winner; yet even they allow that he cheated at Waterloo, and was
enabled to win the last great trick:-so it was hinted at head-quarters in
England, that some foul play must have taken place in order to account
for the continuous successes of Colonel Crawley.
Though Frasscati's and the Salon were open at that time in Paris, the
mania' for play was so widely spread, that the public gambling-rooms did
not suffice for the general armour, and gambling went on in private houses
as much as if there had been no public means for gratifying the passion.
At Crawley's charming little reunions of an evening this fatal amusement
commonlywas practised-much good-natured litterS, Crawley's annoy-
ance. She spoke about her husband's passion for dice with the deepest
grief; she detailed it to everybody who came to her house. She besought
thc young fellows never, never to touch a box; and when young Green,
of the rifles, lost a very considerable sum of money, rebecca passed a
whole night in tears, as the servant told the unfortunate young gentleman,
and actually went on her knees to her husband to beseech him to remit
the debt, and burn the acknowledgment. How could he He had
lost just as much himself to Blackstone of the Hussars, and Count
Punter of the Hanoverian Cavalry. Green might have any decent time;
but pay ?-of course he must pay;-to talk of burning I O U's was
child's-play.
Other officers, chiefly young-for the young fellows gathered round Mrs.
Crawley-came from her parties with long face, having dropped more or
less money at her fatal card-tables. Her house began to have an unfor-
tunate reputation. The old hands warned the less experienced of their
danger. Colonel O'Dowd, of the -th regiment, one of those occupying
in Paris, warned Lieutenant Spooner of that corps. A loud and violent
fracas took place between the infantry-colonel and his lady, who were dining
at the Cafe le Paris, and Colonel and Mrs. Crawley, who were also taking
their meal there. The ladies engaged on both sides. Mrs. O'Dowd snapped
her fingers in Mrs. Crawley's face, and called her husband '` no better
than a black-leg.'' Colonel Crawley challenged Colonel O'Dowd, C.B.
1he Commander-in-Chief hering of the dispute sent for Colonel Crawley,
who was getting ready the same pistols, `which he shot Captain Marker,'
nd and such a conversation with him that no duel took place. If Rebecca
had not gone on her knees to General Tufto, Crawley would have been
sent back to England; and he did not play, except with civilians, for
some weeks after.

became evident to Rebecca, considering these things, that their position
was but a precarious one, and that even, although they paid scarcely any-
body, their little capital would end one day by dwindling into zero.
 Gambling,'' she would say, `` dear, is good to help your income, but not
as an income itself. Some day people may be tired of play, and then
where are we'' Rnwdon uaequiesced in the justice of her opinion; and
in truth he had remarked that after a few nights of his little suppers, &c.,
gentlemen were tired of play with lim, and, in spite of Rebecca's charms,
did not present themselves very eagerly.
Easy and pleasant as their life at Paris was, it was after all only an
idle alliance and amiable tripling ; and Rebecca saw that she must push
Rawdon's fortune in their own country. She must get him a place or
appointment at home or in the colonies; and she determined to make a
move upon England as soon as the way could be cleared for her. As a
first step she had made Crawley sell out of the Guards, and go on half-
pay. His function as aide-de-cnp to General Tufto had censed pre-
various. Rebecca laughed in all companies nt that officer, at his toupee
(which he mounted on coming to Paris), at his waistband, at his false
teeth, at his pretensions to be a lady-killer above all, and his absurd
vanity in faneying every woman whom he came year was in love with him.
It was to Mrs. Brent, the beetle-brewed wife of Mr. Commissary Brent, to
whom the General transferred his attentions now-his bouquets, his
dinners at the restaurateurs, his opera-boxes, and his knick-knacks. Poor
Mrs. Tufto was no more happy than before, and hal still to pass long
evenings alone with her daughters, knowing that her General was gone off
scented and curled to stand behind Mrs. Brent's chair at the play.
Becky had a dozen admirers in his place to be sure; and could cut her
rival to pieces with her wit. But as we have said, she was growing tired
of this idle social life: opera-boxes and restaurateur-dinners called upon
her: uosegays could not be laid by as a provision for future years: and
she could not live upon knick-knacks, laced handkerchiefs, and kid gloves.
She felt the frivolity of pleasure, and longed for more substantial benefits.
At this juncture news arrived which was spread among the many
creditors of the Colonel at Paris, and which causes them great satisfaction.
Miss Crawley, the rich and from whom he expected his immense inherit-
ance, was dying; the Colonel must haste to her bed-side. Mrs. Crawley
and her child would remain behind until he came to reclaim them. He
departed for Calais, and having reached that place in safety, it might have
been supposed that he went to Dover; but instead he took the Diligent
to Dunkirk, and thence travelled to Brussels, for which place he had a
former predilection. The fact is, he owed ore money at London than at
Paris; and he preferred the quiet little Belgian city to either of the more
noisy capitals.
Her aunt was dead. Mrs. Crowley ordered the most intense mourning
for herself and little Rawdon. TheColonel was busy arranging the affairs
of the inheritance. They could take the premier now, instead of the little
entirely of the hotel which they occupied. Mrs. Crawley and the landlord
had a consultation about the new hangings, an amicable wrangle about the
carpets, and a final adjustment of everything except the bill. Bhe went

off in one of his carriages; her French one with her; the child by her side;
the admirable landlord and landlady smiling farewell to her from the gate.
General Tufto was furious when he heard she was gone, and Mrs. Brent
furious with him for being furious ; Lieutenant Spooner was cut to the
heart; and the landlord got ready his best apartments previous to the
return of the fascinating little woman and her husband.  He erred the
trunks which she left in his charge with the greatest care. They had
been especially recommended to him by Madame Crawley. They were not,
however, found to be particularly valuable when opened some time after.
But before she went to join her husband in the Belgic capital, Mrs.
Crawley made an expedition into England, leaving behind her her little
son upon the continent, under the care of her French maid.
The parting between Rebecca and the little Rawdon did not cause either
party much pain. She had not, to say truth, seen much of the young
gentleman since his birth. After the amiable fashion of French mothers,
she has placed him out at nurse in a village in the neighbourhood of Paris,
where little Rawdon passed the first month of his life, not unhappily, with

Rebecca did not care much to go and see the son and heir. Once he

caresses to his mamma's, and when finally he quito that jolly nurse and
almost parent, he cried loudly for hours. IIe was only consoled by lia

the nurse herself, who probably would have been pained at the parting
too, was told that the child would immediately be restored to her, and for
some time awaited quite anxiously is return.
In fact, our friends may be said to have been among the first of that
brood of hardy English adventurers who have subsequently invaded the
Continent, and swindlcd in all the capitals of Europe. The respect in those
happy days' of 1817-18, was very great, for the wealth and honour of
Britons. They had not then learned, as I am told, to laggle for bargains
with the pertinacity which now distinguishes them. The great cities of
Europe had not been as yet open to the enterprise of our rascals. And

Rebecca's object in her journey to London was to effect a kind

secure a return for him into his own country. It does not become us
to trace the steps which she took in the conduct of this most difficult

which she was empowered to offer was all her husband's available capital,
and having convinced them that Colonel Crawley would prefer a perpetual
retirement on the continent to a residence in this country with his debts
unsettled; having provel to thoma tat there was no possibility of money
arguing to him from other quarter, and no earthly chance of their getting
a larger dividend than that which she was empowered to offer, she brought
the Colonel's creditors unanimously to accept her proposals, and purchased
with fifteen hired pounds of ready money, more than ten times that
amount of debts.
Mrs. Crowley employed no lawyer in the transaction. The matter was
so simple, to have or to leave, as she justly observed, that she made the
lawyers of the creditors themselves to the business. And Mr. Lewis
representing Mr. Davids of Red Lion square, and Mr. Moss acting for
Mr. Manasseh of Cursitor Street, (chief creditors of the Colonel's), comply-
melted his lady upon the brilliant way in which she did business, and
declared that there was no professional man who could beat her,
Rebecca received their congratulations with perfect modesty ; ordered a
bottle of sherry and a bread cake to the little dingy lodgings where she
dwelt, while conducting the business, to treat the enemy's lawyers; shook
hands with them at parting, in excellent good humour, and returned
straightaway to the continent, to rejoin her husband and son, and equity
the former with the glad news of his entire liberation. As for the latter,
he had been considerably neglected during his mother's absence by
Mademoiselle Genevieve, her French maid; for that young woman, con-
tracking an attachment for a soldier in the garrison of Calais, forgot her
charge in the society of this nilitaire, and little Rawdon very narrowly
escaped drowning on Calais sends at this period, where the absent Genevieve
had left and lost him.
And so, Colonel and Mrs. Crawley came to London : and it is at their
house in Curzon Street, May Fair, that they really showed the skill which
must be possessed by those who would live on the resources above named.

necessity, we are bound to describe how a house
may be got for nothing a-year. These mansions
are to be had either unfinished, where, if you
have credit with Messrs. Pillows or Banting,
you can get them splendid arranged and deco-
rated entirely, according to your own fancy; or
they are to be let furnished; a less troublesome
and complicated arrangement to most parties.
It was so that Crawley and his wife preferred to
hire their house.
Before Mr. Bowls cme to preside over Miss
Crawley's house and cellar iu Park Lane, that
lady had had for a butler, a Mr. Raggles, who
was born on the family estate of Queen's Crawley,
and indeed was a younger son of a gardener
there. By good conduct, a handsome person
and calves, and grave demeanour, Raggles rose from the knife-board to
the foot-board of the carriage; from the foot-board to the butler's pantry.
When he had been a certain number of years at the head of Miss Crawley's
establishment, where he had had good wages, fat prerequisite, and plenty of
opportunities of saving, he announced that he was about to contract n
matrimonial alliance with a late cook of Miss Crawley's, who had subsisted
in an honourable manner by the exercise of a tangle, and the keeping of a
small green shop in the neighbourhood. The truth is, that the ceremony
had been clandestinely performed some years back; although the news of
Mr. Raggle's marriage was first brought to Miss Crawley by a little boy
and girl of seven and eight years of age, whose continual presence in the
kitchen had attracted the attention of Miss Briggs.
Mr. Raggles then retired and personally undertook the superintendence
of the small shop and the greens. He added milk and dream, eggs and
country fed pork to his stores, contenting himself, whilst other retired
butlers were vending spirits in public houses, by dealing in the simplest
country produce. And having a good connection amongst the butlers in
the neighbourhood, and a snug back parlour where he and Mrs. Raggles
received them, his milk, cream, and eggs got to be adopted by many of
the fraternity, and his profits increased every year. Year after year he
quietly and modestly amassed money, and when at length that snug and
complete bachelor's residence at No. 201, Curzon Street, My Fair, lately
330
vANITY FAIR.
the residence of the Honourable Frederick Decrease, gone abroad, with
its rich and appropriate furniture by the first makers, was brought to the
hammer, who should go in and purchase the lease and furniture of the
house but Charles Raggles? A part of the money he borrowed, it is true,
and at rather a high interest, from a brother butler, but the chief part he
paid down, and it was with no snl pride that Mrs. Raggles found herself
sleeping in a bed of carved mahogany, with silk curtains, with a prodigious
chevnl glass opposite to her, and a wardrobe which would contain her, and
Raggles, and all the family.
Of course, they did not intend to occupy permanently an apartment
so splendid. It was in order to let the house again that Raggles pur-
chased it. As soon as a tenant was found, he subsided into the green-
grocer's slop once more; but a happy thing it was for him to walk out of
that tenement and into Curzon Street, and there survey his house-his
own house-with geraniums in the window and a curved bronze knocker.
The footman occasionally lounging at the area railing, treated him with
respect; the cook took her green stuff at his house and called him Mr.
Landlord; and there was not one thing the tenants did, or one dish
which they had for dinner, that Raggles might not know of, if he liked.
He was a good man; good and happy. The house brought him in so
handsome a yearly income, that he was determined to send his children to
good schools, and accordingly, regardless of expense, Charles was sent to
boarding at Dr. Swishtail's, sugar-cue Lodge, and little Matilda to Mis
Peekover's, Luurentinum House, Clapham.
Raggles love and adored the Crawley family as the author of all his
prosperity in life. He had a silhouette of his mistress in his back shop,
and a drawing of the Porter's LOdge at queen's Crawley, done by that
spinster herself in India in-and the only addition he made to the deco-
rations of the Curzon Street Ions was a point of queen's Crawley in
Hampshire, the Seat of Sir Walpole Crawley, Baronet, who was repre-
seated in a gilded car drawn by six white horses, and passing by a lake
covered with swans, and barges containing ladies in hoops, and musicians
with flags and periwigs. Indeed, Raggles thought there was no such
palace in all the world, and no such august family.
As luke would have it, Raggles' house in Curzon Street was to let when
Rawdon and his wife returned to London. The Colonel knew it and its
owner quite well; the latter's connexion with the Crawley family had been
kept up constantly, for Raggles helped Mr. Bowls whenever Miss Crawley
received friends. And the old man not only let his house to the Colonel,
but officiated ns his butler whenever he had company; Mrs. Biggest
operating in the kitchen below, and ending up dinners of which old Miss
Crawley herself might have approved. This was the way, then, Crawley
got his house for nothing : for though Raggles had to pay taxes and rates,
and the interest of the mortgage to the brother butler; and the insurance
of his life,; and the charges for his children at school ; and the value of the
meat and drink which his own family-and for a time that of Colonel
Crawley too-consumed; and though the poor wretch was utterly ruined
by the transaction, his children being flung on the streets, and himself
dion into the Fleet Prison; yet somebody must pay even for gentlemen

who live for nothing a-year-and so it was this unlucky Raggles was
made the representative of Colonel Crawley's defective capital.
I wonder how many families are driven to surgery and to run by great
practitioners in Crawley's way -how many great noblemen rob their petty
tradesmen, condensed to swindle their poor retainers out of wretched
little sums, and cheat for a few shillings When we read that n noble
nobleman has left for the continent, or that another noble nobleman has
an execution in his house-and that one or other owe six or seven
millions, the defeat seems glorious evenaand we respect the victim in the
vastness of his ruin. But who pities a poor barber who can't get his
money for powering the footmen's hands; or a poor carpenter who has
ruined himself by fixing up ornaments and pavilions for my lady's
lien' or the poor devil of n tailor whom the steward patronises, and who
has pledged all he is worth, and more, to get the liveries ready, which my
lord has lone him the honour to bcspcak -When the great house
tumbles down, these miserable wretches fall under it unnoticed: as they
say in the old legends, before a man goes to the devil himself, he sends
plenty of other souls thither.
Rawdon and his wife generously gave their patronage to all such of
Miss Crawley's tradesmen and purveyors ns chose to serve them. Some
were willing enough, especially the poor ones. It was wonderful to see
the ertinacity with which the washerwoman from Tooting brought the
cnrt every Saturday, and her bills week after week. Mr. Raggles himself
and to supply the green-groceries. The bill for servants' porter at the
Fortune of Our public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of heer.
Every servant also was owed the greater part of his wages, and thus kept up
performed an interest in the house. Nobody in fact was paid. Not the
blacksmith who opened the lock; nor the glazier who mendes the plane;
or the robber who let the carriage; for the groom who drove it; for the
butcher who provided the leg of mutton; nor the coils which roasted it;
for the cook who based it; for the servants who sent it: and this I am
given to understand is not infrequently the way in which people live
elegantly on nothing n-year.
In a little town such things cannot be done without remark. We know
there the quantity of milk our neighbour takes, and espy thc joint or the
fowls which are going in for his dinner. So, probably, 200 and 202 in
Curzon Street might know what was going on in the house between
them, the servants communicating through the area-railings; but Crawley
and his wife and his friends did not know 200 and 202. When you came
to 201 there was a hearty welcome, a kind smile, a good dinner, and a
jolly shake of the hand from the host and hostess there, just for all the
world, as if they had been undisputed masters of three or four thousand a
year-and so they were, not in money, but in produce and labour-if they
did not pay for the mutton, they had it: if they did not give bullion in
exchange for their wine, how should we know? Never was better claret at
any man's table than at honest Rawdon's; dinners more gay and neatly
served. His drawing rooms were the prettiest, little, molest salons con-
credible: they were decorated with the greatest taste, and a thousand knick-
knacks from Paris, by Rebecca: and when she ate at her piano drilling

songs with a lightsome heart, the stranger voted himself in a little paradise
of domestic comfort, and agreed that if the husband was rather stupid, the
wife was charming, and the winners the pleasantest in the world.
Rebecca's wit, cleverness, and flipped, made ler speedily the vogue in
London among a certain class. ou saw demure chariots at her door, out
of which stepped very great people. ou beheld her carriage in the park,
surrounded by dandies of note. The little box in the third tier of the
Opera was crowded with heads constantly changing; but it must be con-
messed that the ladies held aloof from her, and that their doors were shut
to our little adventurer.
With regard to the world of female fashion and its customs, the present
writer of course can only speak at second hand. hA man can no more pene-
trade or understand those mysteries than he can know what the ladies talk
about when they go up stairs after dinner. It is only by inquiry and per-
severance, that one sometimes gets hints of those secrets; and by a similar
diligence every person who treads the Pall Mall pavement and frequents the
clubs of this metropolis, knows, either through his own experience or
through some acquaintance with whom he plays at billiards or shares the
joint, something about the genteel world of London, and how, as there
are men (such as Rawdon Crawley, whose position we mentioned before),
who cut a good figure to the eyes of the ignorant world and to the apple-
times in the Park, who behold them consorting with the most notorious
dandies there, so there are ladies, who may be called men's women,
being welcomed entirely by all the gentlemen, und cut or slighted by all
their wives. Mrs. Fireplace is of this sort; the lady with the beautiful
fair ringlets whom you see every day in Hyde Park, surrounded by the
greatest and most famous dandies of this empire. Mrs. lockwood is
another, whose parties are announced laboriously in the fashionable news-
papers, and with whom you see that all sorts of ambassadors and great
noblemen dine; and many more might be mentioned had they to do with
the history at present in hand. But while simple folks who are out of
the world, or country people with no taste for the genteel, behold these
ladies in their seeming glory in public places, or envy them from afar off,
persons who are better instructed could inform them that these envied
ladies have no more chance of establishing themselves in ``society,'' than
the benighted squire's wife in Somersetshire, who reads of their doings in
the Morning Post. Men living about London are aware of these awful
truths. You hear how tirelessly many ladies of seeming rank and wealth
are excluded from this ``society.'' The frantic efforts which they make
to enter this circle, the weaknesses to which they submit, the insults
which they undergo, are matters of wonder to those who take human ar
humankind for a study; and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties
would be s fine theme for any very great person who had the wit, th
leisure, and the knowledge of the English Language necessary for the
compiling of such a history.
Now the few female acquaintances whom Mrs Crawley had known
around, not only declined to visit her when she came to this side of the
channel, but cut her severely when they met in public places. It was
curious to see how the great ladies forgot ler, and no doubt not altogether

a pleasant study to Rebecca. When Lady bBareacres met her in the waiting-
room at the Opera, she gathered her daughters about her as if they would
be contaminated by a touch of Becky, and retreating a step or two, placed
herself in front of them, and stared at her little enemy. To stare Becky
out of countenance required n severe glance than even the frigid old
Barencres could shoot out of her dismal eyes. When Lady de la Mole, who
has ridden a score of times by HObbes's side at Brussels, met Mrs. Crawley's
open carriage in Hyle Park, her Ladyship was quite blind, and could not in
the last recognize her former friend. Even Mrs. Blenkinsop, the banker'as
wife, cut her at church. Becky went regularly to church now ; it was edi-
flying to see her enter there with Rawdon by her side, carrying a couple of
large gilt prayer-books, and afterwards going through the ceremony with
the gravest resignation.
Rawdon at first felt very acutely the lights which were passed upon his
wife, and was inclined to be gloomy andsavage: He talked of calling out
the husbands or brothers of every one of the insolent women who did not
pay a proper respect to his wife; and it was only by the strongest com-
hands and entreaties on her part, that he was brought into keeping n
decent behaviour. ' you can't shoot me into society,'' she said good-
naturedly. ``' Remember, my dear, that I was but a governess, and
you, you poor silly old man, have the worst reputation for debt, and dice,
and all sorts of wickedness. We shall get quite as many friends as we
want by and by, and in the mean while you must be a good boy, and
obey your schoolmistress in every thing she tells you to do. When ve

and I intend to make a man of you yet. Who sold your horses for you
Who paid your debts for you'' Rawdon was obliged to confess that
he owed all these benefits to his wife, and to trust himself to her guidance
for the future.
Indeed, when Miss Crawley quieted the world, and that money for
which all her relatives had been fighting so eagerly was finally left to
Pitt, Bute Crawley, who found that only five thousand pounds had been
left to him instead of the twenty upon which he calculated, was in such a
fury at his disappointment, that he vented it in savage abuse upon his
nephew; and the quarrel always ranking between them ended in an utter
334
VANITY FAIR.
breach of intercourse. Radon Crawley's conduct, on the other hand,
who got but a hundred pounds, was such as to astonish his brother and
delight his sister-in-law, who was disposed to look kindly upon all the
members of her husband's family. He wrote to his brother a very frank,
manly, good-humoured letter from Paris. He was aware, he said, that
by his own marriage he had forfeited his aunt's four; and though he
did not disguise his disappointment that she should have been so entirely
relentless towards him, he was glad that the money was still kept in their
branch of the family, and heartily congratulated his brother on his good
fortune. He sent his affectionate remembrances to his sister, and hoped
to have her good-will for Mrs, Crawley; and the letter concluded with a
postscript to Pitt in the latter ldy's own hand-writing. She, too, begged
to join in her husband's congratulations. She should ever remember Mr
Crawley's kindness to her in early days when she was a friendless orphan,
the instructors of his little sisters, in whose welfare she still took the
attendees interest. She wished him every happiness in his married life,
and, asking his permission to offer her remembrances to Lady Jane (of
whose goodness all the world informed her), she hoped that one day she
might be allowed to present her little boy to his uncle and aunt, and
begged to bespeak for him their good-will and protection.
Pitt Crawley received this letter very graciously-more graciously than
Miss Crawley had received some of Rebecca's previous compositions in
Rawdon's hand-writing; and is for Lady Jane, she was so charmed with
the letter, that she expected her husband would instantly divide her
aunt's legacy into two equal portions, and send off one-half to his brother
at Paris.
To her ladyship's surprise, however, Pitt declined to accommodate his
brother with a check for thirty thousand pounds. But he made Rawdon
a handsome over of his hand whenever the latter should come to England
and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs, Crawley for her good opinion of
himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to take
any opportunity to serve her little hoy.
Thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers.
When Rebecca came to town Pitt and his wife were not in London. Many
a time she drove by the old door in Park Lane to see whether they had
taken possession of Miss Crawley's house there. But the new family did
not make its appearance; it was only through angles that she heard of
their movements-how Miss Crawley's domestic had been dismissed with
decent gratuities, and how Mr. Pitt and only once made his appearance in
London, when he stopped for a few days at the house, did business with
his lawyers there, and sold off nll Miss Crawley's French novels to a book-
seller out of Bond Street. Becky had reasons of her own which caused
her to long for the arrival of her new relation. ``When Lady Jane comes,''
thought she, `` she shall be my sponsor in London society; and as for
the women bah l-the women will ask me when they find the men want
to see me.''
An article as necessary to a lady in this position as her Brougham or
ler bouquet, is her companion. I have always admired the way in which

ugly plain friend of their own sex from whom they are almost inseparable.
The sight of that inevitable woman in her failed gown seated behind her
dear friend in the opera-box, or occupying the back seat of the barouche,
is always a wholesome and moral one to me, as jolly a reminder as that of

strange sardonic memorial of vanity Fair. What -een battered, brazen,

BAlloon,'' sail Decay, very late one night s a party of gentlemen
were seated round her crackling drawing-room fire ; (for the men came to
her house to finish the night; and she and ice and collee for them, the
best in London): ''I must have a sheep-dog.''
'A what '' asid Rawdon, looking up from an care' table.
A sheep-dog,'' said young Lord Touchdown.  My dear Mrs.
Crowley, what a fancy Why not have a Danish dog I know of one
as big as a camel-leopard, by Jove. It would almost pull your Brougham.

that would go into one of Lord Steyne's snuff-boxes There's a man at
Bayswater got one with such a note that you might,-I mark the king
and play,-that you might hang your hat on it.''
I mark the trick,'' Rawdon gravely said. He attended to his game
commonly, and didn't much meddle with the conversation except when it
was about horses and betting.
e What can you want with a shepherd's dog?'' the lively little South-
down continued.
`I mean a moral shepherd's dog,'' said Becky, laughing, and looking
up at Lord Steyne.
What the devil 's that'' said his Lordship.
`'A lot to keep the wolves off me,'' Rebecca continued. "A com-
anion.''
Dear little innocent lamb, you want one,'' said the MArquis; and his
jaw thrust out, and he began to grin hideously, his little eyes leering
towards Rebecca.
The great Lord of Steyne was standing by the fire sipping coffee. The
fire crackled and blazed pleasantly. There was a score of candles sparkling
round the mantelpicce, in all sorts of quint sconces, of gilt and bronze
and porcelain. They lighted up Rebecca'as figure to admiration, as she
sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers. She was in a pink
dress, that looked as fresh as a rose; her dazzling white arms and shoulders
were half covered with a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled; her
hair hung in curls round her neck; one of her little feet seeped out from

the fresh crisp folds of the silk: the prettiest little foot in the prettiest
little sandal in the finest silk stocking in the world.
The candles lighted np Lord Steyne's shining old head, which was
fringed with red hair. He had thick bushy eyebrows, with little twinkling
bloodsliot eyes, surrounded by a thousand wrinkles. His jaw was under-
hung, and when he laughed, two white buck-teeth protruded themselves
and glistened savagely in the midst of the grin. He had been dining
with royal personages, and wore his gunter and ribbon. A short man was
his Lordship, broad-chested, and bow-legged, but proud of the fairness of
his foot and ankle, and always caressing his garter-knee.
`And so the shepherd is not enough,'' said he, ``to defend his lambkin''
The Shepherd is too fond of playing at cards and going to his clubs,''
answered Becky, laughing.
'Gad, what a debauched Corydon1'' said my lord-'' what a month

e HIark ut Melodies,'' asnarled the noble Marquis ``he's pastoral

hey? Damme, what a snowy fleece1''
Rebecca's eyes shot out gleams of scornful humour.  My lord,'' she
said, ``you are a knight of the Order.'' He had the collar round his neck,
indeed-a gift of the restored Princes of Spain.
Lord Steyne in early life had been notorious for his daring and his
success at play. He has sat up two days and two nights with Mr. Fox at
harold. He had won money of the most august personages of the realm:
he had won his marquise, it was said, at the gaming-table ; but he did
not like an allusion to those by-gone treaties. Rebecca saw the cowl
gathering over his heavy brow.
Bhe rose up from her sofa, and went and took his coffee cup one of his
hand, with a little curtsey.  Yes,'' she said, ` I must get a watch-dog.
But he won't back at you.'' And, going into the other drawing-room, she
sat down to the piano, and began to sing little French songs in such a
charing, thrilling voice, that the mollified nobleman speedily followed
her into that chamber, and might be seen nodding his head and bowing
time over her.
Radon and his friend meanwhile played care until they had enough.
The Colonel won; but, say that he won ever so much and often, nights
like these, which occurred many times in the week-his wife having all
the talk and all the admiration, and he sitting silent without the circle, not
comprchending a word of the jokes, the allusions, the mystical language
within-must huavc been rather wearisome to the ex-dragoon.
 1Town is Mrs. Crawley's husband,'' Lord Steyne used to say to him by
way of a good day when they met: and indeed that was now his vocation
in life. He was Colonel Crawley no more. He was Mrs. Crawley'a
husband.
About the little Rawdon, if nothing has been said all this while, it is

of him. He passed the days with his French loe as long as the
domestic remained in Mr. Crawley's family, and when the frenchwoman
went away, the little fellow, howling in the loneliness of the night, had
compassion taken on him by a housemaid, who took him out of his solitary
nursery into her bed in the garret hard by, and comforted hi.
Rebecca, my Lord Steyne, and one or two more were in the drawing-
room taking tea after the Opera, when this shouting was heard overload.
It's my cherub crying for his nurse,'' she said. She did not offer to
move to go and see the child. :Don't agitate your feelings by going to

with a sort of blush, '' he'll cry himself to sleep;'' and they fell to talking
about the Opera.
awdon and stolen off though, to look after his son and heir; and came
back to the company when he found that honest Dolly was consuming the
child. The Colonel's dressing-room was in those upper regions. He used
to see the boy there in private. They had interviews together every
morning when he shaved; Rawdon minor sitting on a box by his father's
side and watching the operation with never ceasing pleasure. le and
the fire were great friends. The father would bring him sweet-meats from
the lesser, anl while them in a certain old epaulet box, where the child
went to see them, and Laughed with joy on discovering the treasure:
Laughed, but not to loud: for mamma was blow asleep and must not
be disturbed. She did not go to rest till very lte, and seldom rose
till after noon.
Rawlon bought the boy plenty of picture-books, and crammed his
nursery with toys. Its walls were covered with pictures pasted up
by the father's own hand, and purchased by him for ready money.
When he was of duty with Mrs. Rawdon in the Park, he would sit up
here, passing hours with the boy; who rode on his chest, who pulled his
great pistachios as if they were driving-rains, and spent days with him
in indefatignuble symbols. The room was a low room, and once, when the
child was not five years old, his father, who was tossing him wildly up in
his arms, hit the poor little chap's skull so violently against the ceiling
that he almost dropped the child, so terrified was he at the disaster.
Rawdon minor had made up his face for a tremendous howl-the
severity of the blow indeed authorised that indulgence: but just as le
was going to begin, the father interposed.
`For God's sake, Randy, don't wake mamma,'' he cried. Ad the
child looking in a very hard and pirates way at his father, bit his lips,
clenched his lands, and didn't cry a bit. Rnwdon told the story at the
clubs, at the mess, to everybody in town. ` By Gad, Sir,'' he explained
to the public in general, `` what a good plucked one that boy of mine is-
what a trump he is A half sent his head through the ceiling, by Gad,

perpetually in it: or else magnificent curling ostrich feathers, soft and
snowy as Cnmellias. She nodded twice or thrice patronisiugly to the little
boy, who looked up from his dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was
painting. Wen she left the room, an odour of rose, or some other magical
fragrance lingered about the nursery. She was an unearthly being in his
eyes, superior to his father-to all the world: to be worshipped and
admired at a distance. To drive with that lady in the carriage was an
awful rite: he sate up in the back seat, and did not dare to speak: he gazed
with all his eyes at the beautifully dressed princess opposite to him.
Gentlemen on splendid prancing horses came up, and smiles and talked
with her. IIow her eyes beamed upon all of them Her and used to
quiver and wave gracefully as they passed. When he went out with her
he had his new red dress on. His old brown holland was good enough
when he said at home. Sometimes, when she was away, and Dolly his
maid was making his bed, he came into his mother's room. It was as
the abode of a fairy to him-a mystic chamber of splendour and delights.
There in the wardrobe hung those wonderful robes-pink and blue, and
many-tinted. There was the jewel-case, silver-classic: and the mystic
bronze hand on the dressing-table, glistening all over with a hundred
rings. There was the cheval-glass, that miracle of art, in which he could
just see his own wondering head, and the reflection of Dolly (queerly
distorted, and as it up in the ceiling), pumping and patting the pillows of
the bel. O, thou poor lonely little benighted boy? Mother is the
name for God in the lips and hearts of little children ; and here was one

Now Rawdon Crawley, rascal as the Colonel was, had certain manly
tendencies of affection in his heart, and could love a child and a woman
till. For Rawdon minor he had a great secret tenderness then, which
did not escape been, though she did not talk about it to her husband.
It did not annoy her: she was too good-natured. It only increased
her scorn for him. He felt somehow ashamed of this paternal softness,
nnl hid it from his wife-only indulging in it when alone with the boy.
IIe used to take it out of mornings, when they would go to the stables
together and to the Park. Little Lord Touchdown, the best-natured of
men, who would make you a present of the hat from his head, and whose
main occupation in life was to buy knick-knacks that he might give them
away afterwards, bought the little chap a pony not much bigger than a
large rat, te donor said, and on this little black Shetland piggy young
ltawdun's great father was pleased to mount the boy, and to walk by his
side in the Park. It pleased him to see his old quarters, and his old
follow-guardsmen at Knightsbridge: he had begun to think of his
buchelorhool with something like regret. The old troopers were glad to
recognise their ancient officer, and under the little Colonel. Colonel
Crawley found dining at mess and with his brother-officers very pleasant.

per servant and maitre ' del. He went on her errands: obeyed her
orders without question: drove in the carriage in the ring with her without
refining; took her to the Opera-box; solace himself at his club during
the performance, and came punctully back to fetch her when luo. He
would have liked her to be a little founder of the boy: but even to that he
reconciled himself.  Hung it, you know she 's so clever,'' he said, `` and
I 'm not literary and that, you know.'' For, as we have said before,
it requires no great wisdom to be able to win at cards and billiards, and
lawton made no pretensions to any other sort of skill.
When the companion came, his lomnestie duties became very light. His
wife encouraged him to dine abroad: she would let him off duty at the
Opera. Don't stay and stupily yourself at home to-light, my dear,''
she would say.  Some men are coming who will only bore you. I
would not ask them, but you know it's for your good, and now I had
a sheep-dog, I need not be afraid to be alone.''

One Sunday morning, as Rawvdon Crawley, his little son, and the pony
were taking their accustomed walk in the Park, they passed by an old
acquaintance of the Colonel's, Corporal Clink, of the regiment, who was in
conversation with a friend, in oll gentleman, who held a boy in his
arms about the age of little Rawdon. This other youngster had seized
hold of the Waterloo mclal which the Corporal wore, and was examining
it with delight.
 Good morning, your Honour,'' said Clink, in reply to the '` How-do,
Clink2'' of the Colonel.  This are young gentleman is about the little
Colonel's age, Sir,'' continue the Corporal.
His father was a Waterloo man, too,'' said the old gentleman, who
carried the boy. :Wasn't he, Georgy ?''

at each other with all their might-solemnly scanning each other as
children do.
 In a line regiment,'' Clink said with a patronising air.
IIe was a Captain in the -th regiment,'' said the old gentleman
rather pompous, Captain George Osborne, Sir-perhaps you knew
him. He died the death of a hero, Sir, fighting against the Corsican
tyrant.''
Colonel Crawley brushed quite red. `I knew him very well, Sir,'' he
said, '` and his wife, his dear little wife, Sir-how is she?''
She is my daughter, Sir,'' said the old gentleman, pulling down the
boy, and taking out a card with great security, which he handel to the
Colonel. On it was written-
Mr. Sedley, Sole Agent for the Black Diamond and Anti-Cinder Coal
Association, Bunker's Wharf, Thames Street, and hua-MAria Cottages,
Ulam Road West.
Little Georgy went up and looked at the Shetland pony.
:Should you like to have a ride'' said Audubon minor from the saddle,

VANITY FAIR.
Yes,'' said Georgy. The Colonel, who had been looking at him with
some interest, took up the child and put him on the pony behind Rawdon
minor.
Take hold of him, Georgy,'' he said-`` take my little boy round the
waist-his name is Rawdon.'' And both the children began to laugh.
 You won't see a prettier pair, I think, tli summer's day, Sir,'' said the
good-natured Corporal; and the Colonel, the Corporal, and old Mr. Sedley
with his umbrella, walked by the side of the children.

Our worthy fat friend Joseph
Sedley returned to India not
long after his escape from Brussels. Either his furlough was up, or he
dreaded to meet any witnesses of his Waterloo flight. HOwever it might
be, he went back to his duties in Bengal, very soon after Napoleon had
taken up his residence at Saint Helena, where Jos saw the ex-emperor.
To hear Mr. Sedley talk on board slip you would have supposed that it
was not the first time he and the Corsican had met, and that the civilian
had bearded the French General nt Mount St. John. He had a thousand
anecdotes about the famous battles; he knew the position of every regis-
men, and the loss which each had incurred. He did not deny that he
had been concerned in those victories-that he had been with the army,
and carried dispatches for the dUke of Wellington. And he described
what the Duke did and soil on every conceivable moment of the day of
Waterloo, with such an accurate knowledge of his Grace's sentiments and
proceedings, that it was clear he must have been by the conqueror's side
throughout the day; though, as a non-combatant, his name was not men-
toned in the public documents relative to the battle. Perhaps he actually
worked himself up to believe that he had been engaged with the army;
certain it is that he made a prodigious sensation for some time at Calcutta,
and was called Waterloo Selley during the whole of his subsequent stay
in BEngal.
The bills which Jos had given for the purchase of those unlucky horses
were paid without question by him and his agents. He never was heard

to allude to the bargain, and nobody knows for n certainty what became
of the horses, or how he got rid of them, or of Isidor, his Belgian servant,
who sold a grey horse, very like the one which Jos rode, at Valencicnnes
sometime during the autumn of 1815.
Jos's London agents had orders to pay one hundred and twenty pounds
yearly to his parents at Fulham. It was the chief support of the old
couple; for Mr. Sedley's speculations in life subsequent to his bankruptcy
did not by any means retrieve the broken old gentleman's fortune. He
tried to be a wine-merchant, a coal-merchant, n commission-lottery agent,
kc., &c. He sent round prospectus to his friends whenever he took a
new trade, and ordered a new brass plate for the door, and talked pomp-
would about making his fortune still. But Fortune never came back to the
feeble and stricken old mun. One by one his friends dropped off, and
were henry of buying dear coils and and wine from him; and there was
only his wife in all the world who fancied, when he tattered off to the city
of a morning, that he was still doing any business there. At evening he
crawled slowly back; and he used to go of nights to a little club at a
tavern, where he disposed of the finances of the nation. It was wonder-
ful to hear him talk about millions, and agio, and discounts, and what
Rothschild was doing, and Baring Brothers. He talked of such vast
sums that the gentlemen of the club (the apothecary, the undertaker, the
great carpenter and builder, the parish clerk, who was allowed to come
stealthily, and Mr. CApp, our old acquaintance) respected the old gentle-
man. I was better off once, Sir,'' he did not fail to tell everybody who
`used the room.'  My son, Sir, is at this minute chief magistrate of
Ramgunge in the Presidency of Bengal, and touching his four thousand
rupees per menem. My daughter might be a Colonel's lady if she liked.
I might draw upon my son, the first magistrate, Sir, for two thousand
pound to-morrow, and Alexander would cash my bill, down Sir, down onthe
counter, Sir. But the Sedley were always a proud family.'' You and I,

house landlady's husband; the Munoz of private life; the titular lord
and master: the carer, house-steward, and humble husband of the occupier
of the dingy throne. I have seen men of good bring and breeding, and
of good hopes and vigour once, who feasted squires nd kept hunters in
their youth, meekly cutting up legs of mutton for rancorous old harrovian,
and pretending to preside over their drenry tables-but Mrs. Sedley, we
sny, had not spirit enough to bustle about for ``'a few select inmates to
join n cheerful musical family,'' such as one reads of in the Times. She
was content to lie on the shore where fortune had stranded ler-and
you could see that the career of this old couple was over.
I don't think they were unhappy. Perhaps they were a little prouder
in their downfall that in their prosperity. Mrs. Sedley was always a
great person for her landlady, Mrs. Clapp, when she descended and passed
many hours with her in the basement or ornamental kitchen. The Irish
maid Betty Flanagan's bonnets and ribbons, hcr stainless, her idleess,
her reckless prodigality of kitchen candles, ler consumption of tea and
sugar, and so forth, occupied and amused the old lady almost as much as
the doings of her former household, when she had Sambo and the coach-
man, and a room and n footy, and a housekeeper with a regiment of
female domestic-her former household, about which the good lady talked
a hundred times a-day. And besides Betty FLanagan, Mrs. Sedley had
all the maids-of-all-work in the street to superintend. She knew how
each tenant of the cottages paid or owed his little rent. She stepped
aside when Mrs. Rougemont the actress passed with her dubious family.
She flung up her head when Mrs. Pestler, the apothecary's lady, drove by
in her husband's professional one-horse chaise. She had colloquial with
the green-grocer about the pennorth of turnips which Mr. Sedley loved:
she kept an eye upon the milkman, and the baker's boy: and made visits-
tions to the butcher, who sold hundreds of oxen very likely with less ado
than was made about Mrs. Selley's loin of mutton: and she counted the
potatoes under the joint on 3sundays, on which days, rest in her best, she
went to church twice and read Blair's Sermons in the evening.
On that day, for ``business'' prevented him on week days from taking
such a pleasure, it was old Sedley's delight to take out his little grandson
Georgy to the neighbouring Parks or Kensington Gardens, to see the
soldiers, or to feed the ducks. Georgy loved the red-cots, and his
grandpa told him how his father had been a famous soldier, and
introduced him to many secrets and others with WAterloo models on
their breasts, to whom the old grandfather pompous presented the child
as the son of Captain Osborne of .the -th, who died gloriously on the
glorious eighteenth. IIe has been known to treat some of these non-e
commissioner gentlemen to a glass of porter, and, indeed, in their first
Sunday walks was disposed to spoil little Georgy, sadly gorging the boy
with apples and parliament, to the detriment of his health-until Amelia
declared that George should never go out with his grandpa, unless the
latter promised solemnly, and on his honour, not to give the child and
cakes, lollipops, or stall produce whatever.
Between Mrs. Sedley and her daughter there was a sort of coolness
about this boy, and a secret jealousy-for one evening, in George's very

early days, Amelia, who had been seated at work in their little parlour
scarcely remarking that the old lady had quieted the room, ran up stairs
instinctively to the nursery at the series of the child, who had been asleep
until that moment-and there found Mrs. Sedlley in the act of surrepti-
tedious administering Daffy's Elixir to the infant. Amelia, the gentlest
and sweetest of every-day mortals, when she found tis meddling with
her maternal authority, thrilled and trembled all over with anger. Her
cheeks, ordinarily pale, now flushed up, until they were as red as they used
to be when she was a child of twelve years old. She seized the baby out
of her mother's arms, and then grasped at the bottle, leaving the old
lady gaping at her, furious, and holding the guilty tea-spoon.

Amelia flung the bottle crashing into the fire-place. ` I will not have baby

both her arms round him, and turning with flashing eyes at her mother.

He shall not have any medicine but that which Mr. Pestler sends

Very good: you think I'm a murderess, then,'' replied Mrs. Sedley.

to move all day in my room and at the fine lady-says I'm a murderess.
Ah, Mrs. Osborne! may you never nourish n viper in your bosom, that's

arms set up a frantic chorus of shouts.
`A murderess, indeed1 Go down on your knees and pray to Go to
cleanse your wicked uugrateful heart, Amelia, and may IIe forgive you as I
do;'' and Mrs. Sedley tossed out of the room, hissing out the word poison,
once more, and so ending her charitable beneliction.
Till the termination of her natural life, this breach between Mrs. Sedley
and her daughter was never thoroughly mended. The quarrel gave the
elder lady numberless advantages which she did not fail to turn to account
with female ingenuity and perseverance. For instance, she scarcely spoke
to Amelia for many weeks afterwards. She warned the domestic not to
tone the child, as Mrs. Osborne might he offender. She asked her daughter
to see and satisfy herself that there was no poison prepared in the little
daily messes that were concocted for Georgy. When neighbours asked
after the boy's health, she referred them pointedly to Mrs. Osborne. Sla
never ventured to ask whether the bay was well or not. Sle would not
touch the child although he was her grandson, and own precious darling,
for she was not used to children, and might kill it. And whenever Mr.
Pestler came upon his healing inquisition, she received the Doctor with
such a sarcastic and scornful demeanour, as made the surgeon declare that
not Lady Thistlewood herself, whom he had the honour of attending pro-
fessionally, would give herself greater airs than old Mrs. Sedley, from
whom he never took a fee. And very likely Emmy was jealous too, upon
her own part, as what mother is not, of those who would manage her
children for her, or become candidates for the first place in their affections '
It is certain that when anybody nursed the child, she was uneasy, and
that she would no more allow Mrs. Clapp or the domestic to dress or tend
him, than she would have let them was her husband's miniature which
hung up over er little bed;-the same little bel from which the poor girl
had gone to his; and to which she retired now for many long, silent, tearful,
but happy years.
In this room was all Amelia's heart and treasure. Here it was that she
tended her boy, and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with
n constant passion of love. The elder George returned in him somehow,

only improved, and as if come back from heaven. In a hundred little tones,
looks, and movements, the child was so like his father, that the widow's
heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would often ask the cause
of her tears. It was because of his likeness to his father, she did not
scruple to tell him. She talked constantly to him about this dead father,
and spoke of her love for George to the innocent and wondering child;
much more than she ever had done to George himself, or to any confidante
of her youth. To her parents she neer talked about this matter: shrink-
in from baring her heart to them. Little George very likely could under-
stand no better than the; but into his ears she poured her sentimental
secrets unreservedly, and into his only. The very joy of this woman was
a sort of grief, or so tender, at least, that its expression was tears. Her
sensibilities were so weak and tremulous, that perhaps they ought not to
be talked about in a book. I was told by Dr. Pestler, (now a most
flourishing lady's physician, with a sumptuous dark-green carriage, a pros-
pact of speedy knighthood, and a house in Manchester square,) that her
grief at weaning the child was a sight that would have unmanned a Herod.
He was very soft-hearted many years ago, and his wife was mortally jealous
of Mrs. Amelia, then and long afterwards.
Perhaps the Doctor's lady had good reason for her jealousy: most
women shared it, of those who formed the small circle of Amelia's
acquaintance, and were quite angry at the enthusiasm with which the
other sex regarded her. For almost all men who came near her loved
her; though no doubt they would be at a loss to tell you why. She was
to brilliant, nor witty, nor wise overcome, nor extraordinarily handsome.
But wherever she went she touched and charmed every one of the male
sex, as invariably as she awakened the scorn and inerelulity of her own
sisterhood. I think it was her weakness which was her principal charm:-
a kind of sweet submission and softness, which seemed to appeal to each
man she met for his sympathy and protection. We have seen how in the
regiment, though she spoke but to few of George's comrades there, all the
words of the young fellows at the mess-table would have leapt from their
scnbburds to fight round her: and so it was in the little narrow lodging-
house and circle of Fulham, she interested and pleased everybody. If she
had been Mrs. Mango herself, of the great house of Mango, Plantain, and
Co., Crutches FRiars, and the magnificent proprietors of the Wineries,
fulham, who gave summer dieines frequented by Dukes and Early, and
drove about the parish with magnificent yellow liveries and bay horses,
such as the royal stables at Kensington themselves could not turn out-I
say had she been Mrs. Mango herself, or her son's wife, Lady Mary
Mango, (daughter of the Earl of Castlemouldy, who condeseended to
marry the head of the firm,) the tradesmen of the neighbourhood could
not pay her more honour than they invariably showed to the gentle young
widow, when she passed by their doors, or made her humble purchases at
their shops.
Thus it was not only Mr. Pestler, the medical man, but Mr. Linton, the
young assistant, who doctored the servant maids and small tradesmen,
and might be seen any day reading the Times in the surgery, who openly
declared himself the slave of Mrs. Osborne. He was a personable young

gentleman, more welcome at Mrs. Sedley's lodgings than his principal;
and if anything went wrong with Georgy, he would drop in twice or thrice
in the day, to see the little chap, and without so much as the thought of
a fee. He would abstract lozenges, tamarinds, and other produce from the
surgery-drawers for little Georgy's benefit, and compounded draughts and
mixtures for him of miraculous sweetness, so that it was quite a pleasure
to the child to be ailing. IIe and Pestle, his chief, sate up two whole
nights by the boy in that momentous nand awful week when Georgy had
the measles; and when you would have thought, from the mother's terror,
that there had never been measles in the world before. Would they have
done as much for other people in they set up for the folks at the
Wineries, when Ralph Plantagenet, and Gwendoline, and Guinever Mango

Truth compels one to say, no. They slept quite undisturbed, at least as
far as she was concerned-pronounced her to be a slight case, which
would almost cure itself, sent her in a draught or two, and threw in bark
when the child rallied, with perfect indifference, and just for form's sake.
Again, there was the little French chevalier opposite, who gave lessons
in his native tongue at various schools in the neighbourhood, and who
might be heard in his apartment of nights playing tremulous old guvottes
and minutes, on a weekly old fiddle. Whenever this powdered and
courteous old man, who never missed a Sunday at the convent chapel at
Hammersmith, and who was in all respects, thoughts, conduct, and bear-
ing, utterly unlike the bearded savages of his nation, who curse perfidious
Albion, and seoul at you from over their cigars, in the quadrant arcades
at the present day,-whenever the old Chevalier de Talonrouge spoke of
Mistress Osborne, he would first finish his pinch of snuff, flick away the
remaining particles of dust with a graceful wave of his hand, gather up
his fingers again into as bench, and, bringing the up to his mouth, blow
them open with a kiss, exelaiming, Al, la divine creature I IIe vowed and
protested that when Amelia walked in the Brompton Lines flowers grew
in profusion under her feet. He called little Georgy Cupid, and asked him
news of Venus, his mamma ; and told the astonished Betty Flanagan that
she was one of the Races, and the favourite attendant of the Reine des
flora.
Instances might be multiplied of this easily gained and unconscious
popularity. Did not Mr. Binny, the mild and genteel rate of the district
chapel, which the family attended, call assiduously upon the widow, handle
the little boy on his knee, and offer to teach him Latin, to the anger of the
elderly virgin, his sister, who kept house for him2 There is nothing in

These are but trivial incidents to recount in the life of our heroine.
Her tale does not deal in wonders, as the gentle reader has already no
doubt perceived; and if a journal had been kept of her proceedings during
the seven years after the birth of her son, there would be found few inch
dents more remarkable in it than that of the measles, recorded in the fore-
ging page. Is, one day, and greatly to her wonder, the Reverend MIr.

of any but-but the husband whom she had lost.

(and we do not know how many hours of solitary night-thought, her little
boy sleeping in his crib by her bed-side) to the memory of that departed'
friend. dUring the day she was more active. She had to teach George to
read and to write, and a little to draw. She read books, in order that she
might tell him stories from them. As his eyes opened, and his mind
expanded, under the influence of the outward nature round about him, she
taught the child, to the best of her humble power, to acknowledge the
Maker of all; and every night and every morning he and slc-(in that
awful and touching communion which I think must bring a thrill to the
heart of every man who witnesses or who remembers it)-the mother and
the little boy-prayed to Our Father together, the mother pleading with
all her gentle heart, the child listing after as she spoke. And each time
they prayed to God to bless dear papa, as if he were alive and in the room
with them.
To wash and dress this young gentleman-to take him for a run of the
mornings, before breakfast, and the retreat of grandpa for'`business''--
to make for him the most wonderful and ingenious dresses, for which end
the thrifty widow cut up and altered every available little bit of fiery
which she possessed out of her wardrobe during her marriage-for Mrs.
Osborne herself, (greatly to her mother's vexation, who preferred fine clothes,
especially since her misfortunes) always wore a black gown, and n straw
bonnet with a black ribbon-occupied her many hours of the day. Others
she had to share, at the service of her mother and her old father. She had
taken the pains to learn, and used to play eribbage with this gentleman on
the night when he did not go to his club. She sang for him when he was
so minded, and it was a good sign, for he invariably fell into a comfortable
sleep during the music. She wrote out his numerous memorials, letters,
prospectus, and projects. It was in her hand-writing the most of the
old gentleman's former acquaintances were informed that he had become
an agent for the BIaek Diamond and Anti-Cinder Coal Company, and
could supply his friends and the public with the best coals at -s. pe
chaldron. All he did was to sign the circulars with his flourish and sign-
ture, anl direct them in a shaky, clerk-like hand. One of these papers
was sent to Major Dobbin, - Rest., care of Messrs. Cox and Greenwood;
but the Major being in MAdness at the time, had no particular call for coals.
He knew, though, the hand which had written the prospectus. Good God
what would he not have given to hold it in his own A second prospectus
came out, informing the Major that J. Seley and Company, having esta-
published agencies at Opnorto, Bordeaux, and St., Mary's, were enabled to offer
to their friends nnl the public generally, the finest and most celebrated
growths of ports, sherries, and claret wines at reasonable prices, and under
extraordinary advantages. Acting upon this hint, Dobbin furiously can-
passed the governor, the commander-in-chief, the judges, the regiments, and
everybody whom he knew in thePresidency, and sent home to Sedley and
Co. orders for wine which perfectly astonished Mr. Sedley and Mr. Clapp,
who was the Co, in the business. But no more orders came after that
first burst of good fortune, on which poor old Osborne was about to build
a house in the city, a regiment of clerks, a dock to himself, and correspond-
dents all over the world. The old gentleman's former taste in wine had

gone: the curses of the mess-room assailed MAjor Dobbin for the vile
drinks he had been the means of introducing there; and he bought back
a great quantity of the wine, and sold it at public outcry, at an enormous
loss to himself. As for Jos, who was by this time promoted to a seat at
the Revenue Board at Calcutta, he was wild with rage when the post
brought him out a bundle of these Bacehnalian prospectus, with a
private note from his father, telling Jos that his senior counted upon him
in this enterprise, and had consigned a quantity of select wines to him, as
per invoice, drawing bills upon him for the amount of the same. Jos, who
would do more have it supposed that his father, Jos Sedley's father, of
the Board of Revenue, was a wine merchant asking for orders, than that
he was Juaek Sketch, refused the bills wit sworn, wrote baek contueliously
to the old gentleman, bidding lim to mind his own affairs; and the pro-
tested paper coming back, Sedley and Co. had to take it up with the
profits which they had made out of the Madras venture, and with a little
portion of Lemmy's savings.
Besides ler pension of fifty pounds a-year, there had been five hundred
pounds, as her husband's executor stated, left in the agent's hands at the
time of Osborne's demise, which sum, as George's guardian, Dobbin pro-
posed to put out at  per cent. in an Indian house of agency. Mr.
Sedley, who thought the Major had some roguish intentions of his own
about the money, was strongly against this plan; and he went to the agents
to protest personally against the employment of the money in question, when
he learned, to his surprise, that there had been no such sum in their
hands, that all the late Captain's assets did not amount to a hundred pounds,
and that the five hundred pounds in question must be a separate sum, of
which Major Dolbin kuow the particulars. More than ever convinced
that there was some grocery, old Seley pursued the Major. As his
daughter's nearest friend, he demanded, with a high and, a statement of
the late Captain's accounts. Dobbin's stammering, blushing, and
awkwardness added to the other's convictions that he had a rogue to deal
with; and in a strict tone he toll that officer a piece of his mind, as he
called it, simply stating his belief glut the Major was unlawfully detaining
his late son-in-laws money.
Dobbin at this lost all patience, and if his accuser and not been so old
and so broken, a quarrel might have ensued between them at the Slaughter
Coffee-house, in a box of which place of entertainment the gentlemen had
their colloquy. ``Come up stairs, Sir,'' listed out the Major. :I
insist on your coming up the stairs, and I will show which is the
injured party, poor George or I;'' and, dragging the old gentleman up to
his bed-room, he produced from his desk Osborne's account, and a bundle
of A U's which the latter nhl given, who, to do him justice, was always
ready to give an IN U. eIIo paid his bills in England,'' Dobbin added,
` but he had not a hundred pounds in the world when he fell. I and one
or two of his brother-officers made up the little sum, which was all that we
could spare, and you are to tell us that we are trying to cheat the widow and
orphan,'' Sedley was very contrite and humbled, though the fact is, that

paid all the fees and charges incident upon the calamity and removal of
poor Amelia.
About these expenses oll Osborne had never given himself any trouble
to think, nor any other relative of Amelia, nor Amelia herself, indeed.
She trusted to Major Dobbin as an accountant, took his somewhat con-
fused calculations for granted: and never once suspected how much she
was in his debt.
Twice or three in the year, according to her promise, she wrote him
letters to Madras, letters all about little Georgy. Now le treasured these
papers Whenever Amalia wrote he answered, and not until then. bUt
he sent over endless remembrances of himself to his godson and to her.
He ordered and sent a box of scarfs, and a grand ivory set of chess-men
from China. he pawns were little green and white men, with real swords
and shields; the knights were on horseback, the castles were on the backs
of elephants. : Mrs. Mango's own set at the Wineries was not so fine,''
Mr. Pestler remarked. These chess-men were the delight of George's
life, who printed his first letter in acknowledgment of this gift of his
godpapa. He sent over preserves and pickles, which latter the young
gentleman tried surreptitiously in the sideboard, and half-killed himself
with eating. He thought it was a judgment upon him for stealing, they
were so hot. Emmy wrote a comical little account of this mishap to the
Major: it please him to think that her spirits were rallying, and that she
would be merry sometimes now. le sent over a pair of shawls, n white
one for her, and a black one with palm-leaves fcr her mother, and a pair
of red scearfs, as winter wrappers, for old Mr. Sedley and George. The
shawls were worth fifty guineas a piece at the very least, as Mrs. Selley
knew. She wore hers in state at church at compton, and was congratu-
later by her female friends upon the splendid acquisition. Emmy's, too,
became pretty her modest black gown. `What a pity it is she wont think
of him,'' Mrs. Selley remarked to Mrs. Clapp, and to all her friends of
Brompton. ``Jos never sent us such presents, I am sure, and grudges us
everything. It is evident that the Major is over head and ears in love
with her: and yet, whenever I so much as lint it, she turns red and begins
to cry, and goes and sits up stairs with her miniature. Im sick of
that miniature. I wish we had never seen those odious purse-proud
Osborne,''
-Amidst such humble scenes and associates George's early youth was
passed, and the boy grew up delicate, sensitive, imperious, woman-bred-
domineering the gentle mother whom he loved with passionate affection.
He ruled all the rest of the little world round about him. As he grew, the
elders were amazed at his haughty manner and his constant likeness to his
father. He asked questions about everything, as inquiring youth will do.
The profundity of his remarks and iuterrogatorics astonished his old
grandfather, who perfectly ored the club at the tavern with stories about
the little lad's learning and genius. He suffered his grandmother with
good-humoured indifference. The small circle round about hin believe

very much. The Major wanted to hear that Georgy wvas going to a school,
and hoped he would acquit himself with credit there: or would he have a
good tutor at home it was time that he should begin to learn; and his
godfather and guardian hinted that he hoped to be allowed to defray the
charges of the boy's education, which would fall heavily upon his mother's
strained income. The Major, in a word, was always thinking about
Amelia and her little boy, and by orders to his agents kept the latter pro-
filed with picture-books, paint-boxes, desks, and all conceivable simple-
ments of amusement and instruction. Three days before George's sixth
birth-day, a gentleman in a gig, accompanied by a servant, drove up to
Mr. Sedley's house, and asked to see Master George Osborne : it was
Mr. Woolsey, military tailor, of Conduit Street, who came at the Major's
order to measure the young gentleman for a suit of eloth clothes. He had
had the honour of making for the Captain, the young gentleman's father.
Sometimes too, and by the Major's desire no doubt, his sisters, the
Misses Dobbin, would call in the family carriage to take Amelia and the
little boy a drive if they were so inclined. The patronage and kindness
of these allies was very uncomfortable to Amelia, but she bore it meekly
enough, for her nature was to yield; and, besides, the carriage and its
splendour gave little Georgy immense pleasure. The ladies begged
occasionally that the child might pass s day with them, and he was always
glad to go to that fine garden-house at Denmark Hill, where they lived,
and where there were such fine grapes in the hot-houses ad peaches on
the walls.
One day they kindly came over to Amelia with news which they were
sure would delight ler-something very interesting about their dear
William.
e WHat was it: was the coming lomeP'' she asked with pleasure
beaming in her eyes.
 Oh, no-not the least-but they had very good reason to believe
that dear William was about to be married-and to a relation of a very
dear friend of Amelia's-to Mies Gloria O'Dowd, Sir Michael O'Dowd's
sister, who had gone out to join Lady O'Dowd nt Madras-a very beau-
tiful and accomplished girl, everybody said.''
Amelia sid Out'' Amelia was very very happy indeed. But she
supposed Gloria could not be like her old acquaintance, who was most
kind-but-but she was very happy indeed. And by some impulse, of
which I cannot explain the meaning, she took George in her arms and
kissed him with an extraordinary tenderness. Her eyes were quite moist
when she put the child down ; and she scarcely spoke a word during the
whole of the drive-though she was so very happy indeed.

A cYNICAL CHANTER.
UR duty now takes us back for a brief space to
some old Hampshire acquaintances of ours,
whose hopes respecting the disposal of their
rich kinswoman's property were so woefully
disappointed. After counting upon thirty
thousand pounds from his sister, it was a
heavy blow to Bute Crawley to receive but
five; out of which sum, when he had paid
his own debts and those of Jim, his son at
college, a very small fragment remained to
portion of his four plain daughters. MIrs.
Bute never knew, or at least never acknowledged, how fur ler own tyruan-
nous behaviour had tended to ruin her husband. All that women could
do, she vowed and protested she had done. Was it her fault if slc did
not possess those syeophantic arts which er hypocritical nephew, itt
Crawley, practised' She wished him all the happiness which he merited
out of his ill-gotten gins. ''At least the money will remain in the
family,'' she said, charitable.  Pilot will never seen it, my dear, that
is quite certain; for a greater miser does not exist in England, and he is
as odious, though in a different way, as his spendthuift brother, the
abandoned Rawdon,''
So Mrs. But, after the first shock of rage and disappointment, began
to accommodate herself as best she could to her altered fortunes, and to
save and trenches with all her might. She instructed her ulaughters how
to bear poverty cheerfully, and invented a thousand notable methods to
conceal or evade it. She took them about to balls and public places in
the neighbourhood, with praiseworthy energy; nay, she entertained hcr
friends in a hospitable comfortable manner at the Rectory, and much more
frequently than before dear Miss Crawley's league had fallen in. From
her outward bearing nobody would have supposed that the family had
been disappointed in their expectations: or have guessed from her frequent
appearance in public how she pinched and starved at home. Her girls
had more milliner's furniture than they had ever enjoyed before. They
appeared perseveringly at the Winchester and Southampton assemblies;
they penetrated to Cowes for the race-all and regatta-equities there ; and
their carriage, with the horses taken from the plough, was at work per-

of lying which is more frequent in Vanity Fair than this;: and it may be
remarked how people who practise it take credit to themselves for their
hypocrisy, and fancy that they are exceedingly virtuous and praiseworthy,
because they are able to receive the world with regard to the extent of
their means.
Mrs. Bute certainly thought herself one of the most virtuous won in
in England, and the sight of her happy family was an edifying one to
strangers. They were so cheerful, so loving, so well-educated, so simple
Martha painted flowers exquisitely, and furnished half the charity-bazaars
in the county. Emma was a regular County Bulbul, and her verses in
the `` Hampshire Telegraph'' were the glory of its Poet's Corner. Fanny
and Matilda sng duets together, mamma plying the piano, and the other
two sisters sitting with their ars round each other's waists, and listening
affectionately. Nobody saw the poor girls drumming at the duets in
private. No one saw mamma drilling them rigidly hour after hour. Ina
word, Mrs. Bute put a good face against fortune, and kept up appearances
in the most virtuous manner.
Every thing that a good and respectable mother would o Mrs. Bute
id. She got over yachting men from Southampton, parsons from the
Cathedral Close at Winchester, and officers from the barracks there. She
tried to inveigle the young barristers at sizes, and encouraged Him to

What will not a mother do for the benefit of her beloved ones ?
Between such a woman and her brother-in-law, the odious Baronet at
the IInall, it is manifest that there could be very little in common. The
rupture between Bute and his brother Sir Pitt was complete; indeed,
between Sir Pitt and the whole county, to which the old man was a
scandal. His dislike for respectable society increased with age, and the
lodge-gates had not opened to a gentleman's carriage-wheels since Pitt
and LAdy Jane came to pay their visit of duty after their marriage.
That was an awful and unfortunate visit, never to be thought of by the
family without horror. Pitt begged his wife, with a ghastly countenancc,
never to speak of it; and it was only through Mrs. Bute herself, who till
one everything which took place at the Hall, that the circumstances of
Sir Bute's reception of his son and daughter-in-law were ever known
at nll.
As they drove up the avenue of the Park in their neat and well-appointed
carriage, pItt remarked with dismay and wrath great gaps among the trees
-his trees,-which the old Baronet was felling entirely without license.
The park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin. The drives were ill
kept, and the neat carriage splashed and foundered in muddy pools along
the road. The great sweep in front of the terrace and entrance stair was
black and covered with mosses; thc once trim flower-bcs rank and weedy.
Shutters were up along almost the whole line of the house; the great hall-
for wvas barred after much ringing of the bell; an individual in ribbons
was seen sitting up the black oak stair, as Horrocks at length admitted
the heir of queen's Crawley and his bride into the halls of their fathers.

Hle led the way into Sir Pitts `' Library,'' as it was called, the fumes of
tobacco growing stronger as Pitt and Lady Jane approached that apart-
ment. Sir Pitt ain't very well, Horrocks remarked apologetically, and
hinted that his master was affected with limburg.
The library looked out on the front walk and park. Sir Pitt had
opened one of the windows, and was bawling out thence to the postillion
and Pitt's servant, who seemed to be about to take the baggage down.
Don't move none of them trunks,'' he cried, pointing with a pipe
which he held in his hand.  It 's only n morning visit, Tucker, you

The embrace disconcerted the daughter-in-law somewhat, as the caresses
of old gentlemen unshorn anl perfumed with tobacco might well do. But
she remembered that her brother Touchdown hud pistachios, and smoked
cigars, and submitted to the Baronet with a tolerable grace.

he took a little old case containing jewels of some value. Take that,''
said he, `` my dear; it belonged to my mother, and afterwards to the first
Lady Binkie. Pretty pearls-never gave'me the ironmonger's daughter.
No, no. Take 'em and put 'em up quick,'' sid he, thrusting the case into
his daughter's hand, and clapping the door of the cabinet too, as lorrocks
entered with a silver and refreshments.
 What have you a been and given Pitt's with'' said the individual in
ribbons, when Pitt and Lady Jane had taken leave of the old gentleman.
It was Miss HIorrocks, the butler's laughter-the cause of the scandal
throughout the country-the lady who reigned ow almost supreme at
queen's Crawley.
The rise and progress of those Ribbons had been marked with dismay
by the county and family. The gibbons opened an account at the MId-
bury Branch Savings Bank; the Ribbons drove to Church, monopolising
the pony-chaise, which is for the use of the servants at the Hall. The
domestic were dismissed at her pleasure. The Scotch gardener, who still
lingered on the premises, taking a pride in his walls and hothouses, aud
indeed making a pretty good livelihood by the garden, which he farmed,
and of which he sold the produce at Southampton, found the Ribbons
eating chances in n sunshine morning at the south-wall, and had his cars
boxed, when he remonstrated about this attack on his property. He and
his Scotch wife and his Scotch children, the only respectable inhabitants of
queen's Crawley, were forced to migrate, with their goods and their chattels,
and left the stately comfortable gardens to go to waste, and the flower-
beds to run to secd. Poor Lady Crawley's rose-garden became the
dreariest wilderness. Only two or three domestic shudderel in the bleak
old servant's hall. The stables and offices were vacant, and shut up, and
half ruined. Sir Pitt lived in private, and boozed nightly with Horrocks,
his butler or house-stewart (as he now began to be called), and the ban-
done Ribbons. The times were very much changed since the period
when she drove to Mulbury in the spring-cart, and called the small
tradesmen '' Sir.'' It may have been shame, or it may have been dislike
of his neighbours, but the old Cynic of queen's Crowley hardly issued
from his park-gates at all now. e quarrelled with his agents, and
screwed his tenants by letter. IIis days were past in conducting his own
correspondence ; the lawyers and farm-bailiffs, who had to do business with
him, could not reach him but through the Ribbons, who received them at
the door of the housekeeper's room, which commanded the back entrance
by which they were admitted; and so the Baronet's daily perplexzities
increased, and his embnrrassments multiplied round him.
The error of Pitt Crawley may be imagined, as these reports of his
father's dotage reached the most exemplary and correct of gentlemen.
He trembled daily lest he should hear that the Ribbons was proclaimed
his second legal mother-in-law. After that first and last visit, his father's
name was never mentioned in Pitt's polite and genteel establishment. It
was the skeleton in his house, and all the family walked by it in terror
and silence. The Countess Touchdown kept on dropping per each at the

ssr
lodge-gate the most exciting traits, traits which ought to frighten the
hair of your head. Mrs. But at the parsonage nightly looked out to see
if the sky was red over the elms behind which the Hall stood, and the
mansion was on fire. Sir G. Wapshot and Sir H. Fuddlestone, old friends
of the house, would'not sit on the bench with Sir Pitt at quarter Sessions,
and cut him dead in the High-street of Southampton, where the reprobate
stool offering lis dirty old hands to them. Nothing had any effect upon
him; he put his hands into his pockets, and burst out laughing, as he
scrambled into his carriage and four; he used to burst out laughing at
Lady Touchdown's tracts; and he Laughed at his sons, and at the world,
and at the Ribbons when she was angry, which was not seldom.
Miss Horrocks was installed as housekeeper at queen's Curley, and
ruled all the domestic there with great majesty and rigour. All the
servants were instructed to address her as ' Mum,'' or  Madam''-and
there was one little maid, on her promotion, who persisted in calling her
 My Only,'' without any rebuke on the part of the housekeeper. `There
has been better Indies, and there has been worse, Hester,'' was Miss
Horrocks' reply to this compliment of her inferior: so she ruled, having
supreme power over all except her father, whom, however, she treated
with considerable haughtiness, warning him not to be too familiar in his
behaviour to one ``s was to be a Baronet's lady.'' Indeed, she rehearsed
that exalted part in life with great satisfaction to herself, and to the
amusement of old Sir Pitt, who chuckle at her airs and graces, and
would laugh by the hour together at ler assumptions of dignity and
imitations of genteel life. lIce swore it was as good as a play to see her in
the character of a fine dome, and he made her put on one of the first Ludy
Crawley's court-dresses, swearing, (entirely to Miss HIorrocks' own con-
currence,) that the dress became her prodigiously, nd threatening to
give her off that very instant to Court in a coach-and-four. She had
the ransacking of the wardrobe of the to defunct ladies, and cut and
hacked their posthumous fiery so as to suit her own tastes and figure.
And she would have liked to take possession of their jewels anl triukets
too; but the old Baronet and locked them away in his private cabinet, nor
could she coax or wheelle him out of the keys. And it is a fact, that
some time after she left ucen's Crawley a copy-book belonging to this
lady was discovered, which showed that she had taken great pains in
private to learn the art of writing in general, and especially of writing her
own name as Lady Crawley, Lady Betsy Horrocks, Lady Elizabeth
Crawley, &c.
Though the good people of the Parsonage never went to the Hall, and
shunned the horrid old dotard its owner, yet they kept a strict knowledge
of all that happened there, and were looking out every day for the data-
strophe, for which Miss Horroeks was also eager. But Fate intervened
enviously, and prevented her from receiving the reward due to such
immaculate love and virtue.
One day the Baronet surprised ``her ladlyship,'' as he jocularly
called her, seated at that old and tuneless piano in the drawing-room,
which hal scarcely been touched since Becky Sharp played quadrilles
upon it. Seated at the piano with the utmost gravity, and squalling

to the best of her power in imitation of the music which she had sometimes
heard. The little kitchen-said on her promotion was standing at her
mistress's side, quite delighted during the operation, ad lagging her
head up and down, and crying '`Lor, Mum, 'tis pitiful,''-just like a
genteel sycophant in a real drawing-room.

This incident made the old Baronet roar with laughter, as usual. He
narrated the circumstance a dozen times to Horrocks in the course of the
evening, and greatly to the discomfiture of Miss Horrocks. He trimmed
on the table as if it had been a musical instrument and squalled in imitation
of her manner of singing. He vowed that such a beautiful voice ought to
be cultivated, and declared she ought to have singing-masters, in which
proposals she saw nothing ridiculous. He was in great spirits that night;
and drank with his friend and butler an extraordinary quantity of rum-
and-water-at a very late hour the faithful friend and domestic conducted
his master to his bed-room.
Half an hour afterwards there was a great hurry and bustle in the house.

A OVER WITH0U A HERO.

Lights went about from window to window in the lonely desolate old Hill,
whereof but two or three rooms were ordinarily occupied by its owner.
Presently, a boy on a pony went galloping off to Sudbury, to the Doc-
tor's house there. And in another hour (by which fact we ascertain how
carefully the excellent Mrs. bRute Crawley had always kept up an under-
standing with the great house), that lady in her clogs and clash, the
Reverend Bute Crawley, and James Crawley, her son, had walked over
from the kectory through the park, and had entered the mansion by
the open hall-door.
They passed through the hall and the small oak parlour, on the table of
which stool the three tumblers and the empty rum-bottle which had served
for Sir Pitt's carousel, and through that apartment into Sir Pitt's study,
where they found Miss Horrocks, of the guilty ribbons, with a wild air,
trying at the presses and escritoires with a bunch of keys. She dropped
them with a scream of terror, us little MIrs. Bute's eyes flushed out at her
from under her black clash.
`Look at that, James unl Mr. Crowley,'' tried Mrs. Bute, pointing at
the scared ture of the black-eyed, guilty bench.
 Hc gae 'em me; he gave 'vc me.'' she cried.
Ove them you, you abandoned, crcuturel'' streamed Mrs. Bute.
Bear witness, Mr, Crowley, we found this good-To-nothing woman in the
act of, stealing your brother's property; and she will be hanged, as I
always said-ghewould.''
Betsy looks quite dauntel, flung herself down on her knees, bursting
into teas. ,lut those who know a really good woman are wire that
she is not in a hurry t forgive, and that the humiliation of an enemy is
triumph to her soul.
 Ring the all, James,'' MIrs. Be sil. Go on ringing it till the
people come?' The three or for domestic resident in the deserted old
house came presently nt that angling aul continued sons.
 Put catwoman i the strong-to,'' she said.  We caught her in
the act of robbing Sir Pitt. Mr. Cwley, you'll make out her committal
-and, leddoes, you 'll drive her over in the spring-cart, in the morning,
to Southampton Gaol,''
 My dear,'' interposed the Magistrate ind Rector-'' she 's only-''

elegy. ' There used to be handles, .)here 's the creature's abomiuable

they ain't mine'' And here the unhappy wreltch pulled out from her
pocket a large pair of paste shoe-buckles which had excited her admiration,
and which she had just appropriated out of one of the bookcases in the
study, where they had lain.
'Law, Betsy, how would you go for to tell such a wicked story 1'' said
Hester, the little kitchen-said late on her promotion-`' and to Malam

so much as a beggarly bit of place or a silk stocking out of all the gowns
as you'i had the picking of may I never go to church again,''
 Give up your keys, you hardened hussey,'' hissed out the virtuous
little lady in the clash.
``And here 's a candle, Mum, and if you please, Mum, I can show you
her room, Mum, and the press in the housekeeper's room, Mum, where she
keeps eaps and heaps of things, Mum,'' cried out the anger little Hester
with a profusion of courtesy.
Hold your tongue, if you please. I know the room which the creature
occupies perfectly well. Mrs. Brown, have the goodness to come with me,
and Beldoes don't you lose sight of that woman,'' said Mrs. Bute, seizing
the candle.- Mr. Crowley you had better go up stairs, and see that they
are not murdering your unfortunate brother''-and the clash, escorted
by Mrs. Brown, walked way to the apartment which, as she said truly,
she knew perfectly well.
Bute went up stairs, and found the Doctor from Mulbury, with the
frightened Horrocks over his master in a chair. They were trying to
bleed Sir Pitt Crawley.
WIth the early morning an express was sent of to Mr. Pitt Crawley by
the actor's lady, who assumed the command of everything, and bad
watched the old Baronet through the night. He had been brought back
to a sort of life; he could not speak, but seemed to recognise people.
Mrs. Bute kept resolutely by his bed-side. She never seemed to want to
sleep, the little woman, and did not close her fiery black eyes once, though
the Doctor stored in the arm-chair. Horrocks made some wild efforts
to assert his authority and assist his master: but Mrs. Bute called him
n tipsy old wretch, and made him never show his face again in that house
or he should be transported like his abominahle daughter.
Terrified by her manner he sunk down to the oak parlour where Mr.
James was, who, having tried the bottle standing there and found no liquor
in it, ordered Mr. Horroeks to get another bottle of rum, which he
fetched with clean glasses, and to which the Rector and his son sate down:
ordering Horrocks to put down the keys at that instant and never to show
his face again.
Cowed by this behaviour Horroeks gare up the keys: and he and his
daughter sunk off silently though the night, and gave up possession of
the house of Queen's Crawley.

 IIE heir of Crowley arrived nt
=r s
home, in due time, after this
catastrophe, and henceforth may
be said to have reigned in
queen's Crawley. or though
the old Baronet survived many
months, he never recovered the
use of his intellect or his speech
completely, and the government
of the estate devolved upon his
elder son. In a strange condition
Pitt found it. Sir Pitt was always
buying anl mortgaging: he had
twenty men of business, and
quarrels with each; quarrels with
all his tenants, and lawsuits with
them ; lawsuit with the lawyers;
lawsuits with the Mining and
Dock Companies in which he was
proprietor; and with every person
with whom he nhl business. 1o
unravel these difficulties, nnl set the estate clear, was a task worthy of the
orderly and persevering diplomatic of Pumpernickel : and he set himself
to work with prodigious assiduity. His whole family, of course, was
transported to queen's Crawley, whither Lady Touchdown, of course, can
too,; and the set about converting the parish under the Rector's nose, and
brought down her irregular clergy to the dismay of the angry Mrs. Bute.
Sir Pitt had concluded no bargain for the sale of the living of ucen's
Crawley; when it should drop, er Airship propose to take the patronage
into her own hands, and present a young protege to the Rectory ; on which
subject the diplomatic Pitt said nothing.
Mrs. Bute's intentions with regard to Miss Betsy Horrocks were not
carried into effect: and she said no visit to Southampton Gaol. She
and her father left the Hall, when the latter took possession of the
Crawley Arms in the village, of which he had got a lease from Six
itt. The ex-butler had obtained a small freehold there likewise, which
gave him a vote for the rough. The Rector had another of these votes,
and these and four others formed the representative body which returned
the two members for queen's Crowley.

vANITY FAIR.
There was a show of courtesy kept up between the Rectlory and the
1Hall ladies, between the younger ones at least, for Mrs. Bute and Lady
Touchdown never could meet without battles, and gradually ceased seeing
each butler. Her Ladyship kept her room when the ladies from the Rectory
visited their cousins at the IIall. Perhaps Mr. Pitt was not very much
displeased at these occasional absences of his mamma-in-law. le believed
the Bikie family to be the greatest and wisest, and most interesting in
the world, and her Ladyship and his aunt had long held ascendancy over
him; but sometimes he felt that she commanded him too much. To be
considered young as complimentary doubtless; but at six-and-forty to be
treated as a boy was sometimes mortifying. LAdy Jane yielded up every
thing, however, to her mother. She was only fond of her children in
private; and it was lucky for her that Lady Touchdown's multifarious
business, her conferences with ministers, and her correspondence with all
the missionaries of Africa, Asia, and australasia, &c. occupied the venerable
Countess a great deal, so that she had but little time to devote to her
granddaughter, the little Matilda, and her grandson, Master Pitt Crawley.
1he latter was a feeble child: and it was only by prodigious quantities of
colonel that Lady Southlown was able to keep him in life at all.
As for Sir PItt he retired into those very apartments where Lady
Crawley had been previously extinguished, and here was tended by Miss
Hester, the girl upon ler promotion, with constant care and assiduity.
What love, what fidelity, what constancy is there equal to that of a nurse
with good wages: they sooth pillows: and make arrow-root: they get
up at rights: they bear complain anl qucrulousness: they see the sun
shining out of doors anl dominant lo go abroad : they sleep on arm-
claims, and eat their meals in solitude: thy pass long long evenings doing
nothing, watching the cubes, and the patient's drink simmering in the
ig: they read the weekly paper the whole week through; and LAw'
Serious Call or le Whole Duty of Mln sulfiees thiem for literature for the
year-and we square wit tl bca, when their relations come to see
them once a week, :a Il gu is smuggled in in their linen-basket.
Ladies, what man's love is there that would stand a year's nursing of the
object of his affection? Whereas a nurse will stand by you for ten pounds
a quarter, and we think her too highly paid. At least Mr. Crawley drum-
bled a good deal about ping half as much to Mis Hester for her
constant attendance upon tk Baronet his father.
Of sunshine days this old gentleman was-taken out in a chair on the
terrace-the very clair which Miss ey hd had at Brighton, and
which had been transported thence wifi a number of LAdy Southlown's
elects to queen's Crawley. Lady Jane always walked by the old man:
and was an evident favourite with him. Be used to nod many times to
her and smile when she came in, and utter articulated deprecatory moans
when she was going away. When the door shut upon her he would cry
and sb-whereupon Hester's face and manner, which was always exceed-
singly bland and gentle while her lady was present, would change at once
and she would make faces at him, and clench her first, and scream out
IIold your tongue, you stoopid old fool,'' and twirl away his chair from
the fire which he loved to look at-at which he would cry more. or

this was all that was left after more than seventy years of cunning and
struggling, and drinking and scheig, nd sin and selfishness-a whim-
bering old idiot put in and out of bed and cleaned and fed like a baby.
At last a day came when the nurse's occupation was over. Early one
morning as Pitt Crawley was at his steward's and bailiff's books in the
study, a knock came to the door, and Hester presented herself dropping a
curtsey, and said,
 If you please, ir Pitt, Sir Pitt died this morning, Sir Pitt. I was
a-making of his toast, Sir Pitt, for his gruel, Sir Pitt, which he took every
morning regular at six, Sir Pitt, and-I thought I heard a one-like, Sir
Pitt-and-and-and--''. She dropped another curtsey.

improvements which he would make. lIe would not use his aunt's
money previously, lest Sir PItt should recover, and his outlay be in vain.
All the blinds were pulled down at the Hall in Rector : the church
bell was tolled, and the chancel hung in black; nd Bute Crawley dil'nt
go to a coursing meeting, but went nd diner quietly at Fuddlestone,
where they talked about his deceased brother and young Sir Pitt over
their port. Miss Betsy, who was by this time raised to a saddler at
Sudbury, cried a good deal. The family surgeon role over and paid
his respectful compliments, and inquiries for the health of their lady-
ships.  The death was talked about ant Mulbury and at the Crawley
Arms; the landlord wherceof had become reconciled with the Rector of
late, who was occasionally known to step into the parlour and taste Mr,
Horrocks' mild beer.

husband, Sir Pitt.
I will write, of course,'' Sir Pitt said, ``and invite him to the funeral:
it will he but becoming.''

letter to Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, requesting her presence upon this
melancholy occasion.''
' Jane, I forbid you to put pen to paper'' cried the Countess.
I believe I am the head of this family,'' Sir Pitt repeated; ``and
however much I may regret any circumstance which may lead to your
Ladyship quitting this house, must, if you please, continue to govern it
as I see fit,''

thoughts.
We don't turn you out of our house, Mnmma,'' said the timid Lady
Jane imploring.
You invite such company to it as no Christian lady should meet, and
I will have my horses to-morrow morning.''
HAve the goodness to write, Jane, under my dictation,'' said Sir Pitt
rising and throwing himself into an attitude of command like the Por-
trait of a Gentleman in the Exhibition, '`and begin. queen's Crawley,
September 14, 182.-My der brother--'
Hearing these decisive and terrible words, Lady MAcbeth, who had
been waiting for a sign of weakness or acillation on the part of her
son-in-law, rose, and with a score look, left the library. Lady Jane
looked up to her husband s if she would fain follow ani soothe her
cinema; but Pitt forbade his wife to move.
`She won't go away,'' he said. She has lct her house at Brighton,
and has spent her last half-year's dividends. A Countess living at an in
is a ruined woman. I have been waiting long for an opportunity to take
this-this decisive step, my love; for, as you must perceive, it is impose-
bible that there should be two chiefs in a family: and now, if you please,
we will resume the dictation. My dear brother, the melancholy intelligence
which it is my duty to convey to my family must have long been anticipated
by,''' c.
In a word, Pitt having come to his kingdom, and having By good luck,
or desert rather, as he considered, assumed almost all the furnace which
his other relatives had expected, is determined to treat his family kindly
and respcctably, and make a house of teen's Conley once more. It
pleased him to think that he should be its chief. He proposed to use the
vast influence that his commanding talents and position must speedily
acquire for him in the county to get his brother placed and his cousins
decently provided for, and perhaps had a little sting of repentance as he
thought that he was the proprietor of all that they had hoped for. In the
course of three or four lays' reign his bearing was changed, and his plans
quite fixed : he determined to rule justly and honestly, to depose Lady
Southlown, and to be on the friendliest possible terms with all the real-
tions of his blood.
So he dictated a letter to his brother Rawdon-a solemn and elaborate
letter, containing the profoundest observations, couched in the longest
words, and filling with wonder the simple little secretary, who wrote under
her husband's order. What an orator this will be,'' thought she, ``when
he enters the House of Commons'' (on which point, and on the tyranny of
Lady Touchdown, Pitt and sometimes dropped hints to his wife in bed);
`` how wise and good, and what a genius my husband is I fancied him
a little old; but how good, and what a genius l''
The fact is, Pitt Crawley had got every word of the letter by heart, and
had studied it, with diplomatic severe, deeply and perfectly, long before
he thought it to communicate it to his astonished wife.
This letter, with a huge black border and seal, was accordingly dispatched

Crawley was but half-pleased at the receipt of it.  What's the use of

alone with Pitt after intense. and horses there and back will cost us twenty
pound.''
He carried the letter, as he did all difficulties, to Becky, upstairs in
her bel-room-with her chocolate, which he always made and took to her
of a morning.
He put the tray with the breakfast and the letter on the dressing-table,
before which Becky sate bombing her yellow hair. She took up the black-
edged missive, and having read it, she jumped up from the chair, crying

e He's not left us anything, Becky. I had my share when I came
of age.''
e You 'll never be of age, you silly old man,'' Becky replied. `Run out
now to Madam Bruno's, for I must have some mourning: and get a
rape on your hat, and a black waistcoat--I don't think you've got one;
order it to be brought home to-morrow, so that he may be able to start
on Thursday,''
a You don't mean to go?'' Rawdon interposed.
e Of course I mean to go. I mean that Lady Jane shall present me at
Court next year. I mean that your brother shall give you a seat in Par-
ligament, you stupid old creature. I mean that Lord Steyne shall have
your vote and his, my dear, old, silly man; and that you shall be an
Irish Secretary, or a West Indian Governor: or a Treasurer, or a Consul,
or some such thing.''
Posting will cost a dolce of a lot of money,'' grumbled Rawdon.

the funeral, as he is a relation of the family: but, no-I intend that we
shall go by the conch. They 'll like it better. It seems more humble--''

When the faithful Lord Steyne arrived in the evening, he found Becky
and her companion, who was no other than our friend Briggs, busy
culling, ripping., dipping, and tearing all sorts of black stuffs available
for the melancholy occasion.
 Miss Briggs and I are plunged in grief and despondency for the death
of our apa,'' Rebecca said. : Si Pitt Crawley is dead, my lord. We
have been tearing our hair all the morning, and now we are tearing up
our old clothes,''
Oh, Rebecca, how can you--'' was all that Briggs could say as she
turned up her eyes.
 Oh, Rebecca, how can you-'' echoed my Lord. ``So that old
scoundrel 's deal, is heP IIe might have been a Peer if he had played his
cards better. MIr. Pitt had very nearly made him; but he batted always

remember, Miss Briggs, how you peered in at the door; and saw old Sir
Pitt on his knees to me'' ' Miss Briggs, our old friend, brushed very
much at this reiniscence ; and was glad when Lord Steyne ordered her
to go down stairs and make him a cup of tca.
Briggs was the house-dog whom Rebecca had provided ns guardian of
her innocence and reputation. Miss Crawley had left her a little annuity.
She would have been content to remain in the Crawley family with Lady

and, who was good to her and to everybody; but Lady Touchdown
dismissed poor Briggs as quickly as decency permitted; and Mr.Pitt (who
thought himself much injured by the uncalled-for generosity of his deceased
relative towards a lady who ld only been Miss Crawley's faithful retainer
a score of years) made no objections to that exercise of the dowager's
authority. Bowls and Firkin likewise received their legacies, and their
dismissals; and married and set up a lodging-house, according to the
custom of their kind.
Briggs tried to live with her relations in the country, but found that
attempt was vain after the better society to which she had been accuse-
timed. Those persons, small tradesmen in a country town, quarrelled
over Miss Briggs's forty pounds n-year, as eagerly and more openly than
Miss Crawley's kinafolk had for that lady's inheritance. Briggs's brother,
a radical hatter and grocer, called his sister a purse-proud aristocrat, be-
cause she would not advance as part of her capital to stock his shop: and
she would have done it most likely, but that their sister, a dissenting
shoemaker's lady, at variance with the matter and grocer who went to
another chapel, showed how their brother was on the verge of bankruptcy,
and took possession of BRiggs for a while. The dissenting shoemaker
wanted Miss Briggs to send his son to college, and make a gentleman of
him. Between them the two families got a great portion of her private
savings out of her: and finally she fled to London followed by the
anathemas of both, in determined to seek for servitude gin as infinitely
less onerous than liberty. And advertising in the papers that a '` Gentle-
woman of agreeable manners, and accustomed to the best society was
anxious to,'' &c., she took up her residence with Mr. BOwls in Half Moon
Street, and waited the result of the advertisement.
So it was that she fell in with Rebecca. Mrs. Rawdon's dashing little
carriage and ponies was whirling down the street one day, just as Miss
Briggs, fatigued, had reached Mr. Bowls's door, after n weary walk to the
Times Other in the City, to insert her advertisement for the sixth time.
Rebecca was driving, and at once recognised the gentleman with agree-
able manners, and being a perfectly good-humoured woman, as we have
seen, and having a regard for briggs, she pulled up the ponies at the
door-steps, gave the reins to the groom, and jumping out had hold of
both Briggs's hands, before she of the agreeable manners had recovered
from the shock of seeing an old friend.
Briggs cried, and Becky laughed a great dcnl, and kisscl the gentle-
woman as soon as they got into the passage; and thence into Mrs, Bowls's
front parlour, with the red doreen curtains, and the round looking-glass,
with the mineral cable above, gazing upon the back of the ticket in the
window which announced ' Apartments to Lct.''
Briggs told all her history midst those perfectly uncnllcl-for jobs and
accusations of wonder with which women of her soft nature salute in old
acquaintance, or regard a encounter in the street ; for though people meet
other people every day, yet somc there are who insist upon discovering
miracles; and women, even though they have disliked each other, begin to
cry when they cnet, deploying and rccmbering the time when they last

quarrellel. So, in a word, Briggs told all her history, and Becky gases
narrative of her own life, with her usual lawlessness and cundour.
Mrs. Bowls, late Firkin, came and listened grill in the passage to the
hysterical sniffing and giggling which went on in the front parlour. Becky
had never been a favourite of her's. Since the establishment of the married
couple in London they had frequented their former friends of the house of
Raggles, and did not like the latter's account of the Colonel's image.
`I would'not trust him, Hlagg, my boy,'' Bols remarked: and his wife, when
Mrs. Rawdon issued from the parlour, only saluted the lady with a very
sour curtsey; and her fingers were like so many sausages, cold and lifeless,
when she held them out in deference to Mrs. Rawdon, who persisted in
shaking hands with the retired lady's maid. She whirled away into
Piccadilly, nodding, with the sweetest of smiles towards Miss Briggs, la
hung holding at the window close under the advertisement-card, and at
the next moment was in the Park with a half dozen of dennis catering
after her carriage.
When he found how her friend was situated, and how having n
sung legacy from Miss Crawley, salary was no object to our gentleman,
Becky instantly formed some benevolent little domestic plans concerning
her. This was just such a companion as would suit her establishment.
and she invited Briggs to come to dinner with her that very evening, when
she would show her dear little darling Rawlon.
Mrs. Bowls cautioned her longer against venturing into the lion's don,
t wherein you will run it, Miss l3., mark my words, and as sure as m5
name is Bowls.'' And riggs promised to be very cautious. The upshot
of which caution was that she went to live with MIrs. Rawson the est
week, and had lent Rawdon Cranley six hundred pounds upon aunt
before six more months were over.

Sir Pitt Crawley warned of their
arrival, Colonel Crawley and his
wife took a couple of places in
the same old Highflyer coach, by
which REbecca had travelled in
the defunct Baronet's company,
and on her first journey into the
world some nine years before.
How well she remembered the
Inn Yard, and the ostler to
whom she refused money, and
the insinuating Cambridge lad
who wrapped her in his coat on
the journey. Rawdon took his
place outside, and would have
liked to drive, but his grief for-
bade him. He site by the coach-
man, and talked about horses and
the road the whole way; and
who kept the inns, and who horsed the conch by which he had travelled
so many a time, when he and Pitt were boys going to Eton. At Mulbury
era carriage and a pair of horses received them, with a cochran in black.
It's the old drag, Rawdon,'' Rebecca said, as they got in.  The worms
hae eaten the cloth a good deal-there's the stain which Sir Pitt-hal I
see Dawson the Ironmonger has his shutters up-which Sir Pitt made such
a noise about. It was a bottle of cherry brandy he broke which we went
to fetch for your aunt from Southampton. How time flies, to be sure
that can't be Poly Talboys, that bouncing girl standing by her mother at
the cottage there. I remember her a many little urchin picking weeds
in the garden.''
e ine gal,'' said Rawdon, returning the salute which the cottage gave
him, by two fingers applied to his crape hat-band. Becky bowel and
saluted, and recognised people here and there graciously. Their recog-
nations were inexpressibly pleasant to her. It seemed as if she was not
an impostor any more, and was coming to the home of her ancestors.
Rawdon was rather abashed, and cast down on the other hand. What
recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been fitting across
his brain What pangs of dim remorse and doubt and shame?

e Your sisters must be young women now,'' Rebecca said, thinking of
those girls for the first time perhaps since she had left them.
 Don't know, I'm she,'' replied the colonel.  Hull1 here's old
Mother Look. 1Now-dy-do, Mrs. Lock. Remember me, don't you
Master Hadn, helP Dummy how those old women last; she was a
hundred when I was a boy.''
They were going through theology-gates kept by old Mrs. Lock, whose
hand llebccca insisted upon slaking, as she flung open the creaking old
iron gate, and the carriage passed between the two most-grown pillars
surmounted by the dove and serpent.
 The governor has cut into the timber,'' awdon said, looking about,
and then was silent-so was bEcky. Both of them were rather agitated,
and thinking of old times. IIe about Eton, and his mother, whom he
remembered, n frigid demure woman, and a sister who died, of whom he
had been passionately fond; and how he used to thrash Pitt; and about
little Randy at home. And Rebecca thought about her own youth, and
the dark secrets of those early tainted days; and of her entrance into life
by yonder gates; and of Miss Pinkerton, and Joe, and Amelia.
The gravel walk and terrace lad been scraped quite clean. A grand
painted catchment was already over the great entrance, and two very
solemn and tall personages in black flung open each a lens of the door as
the carriage pulled up at the familiar steps. Rawdon turned red, and
Becky somewhat pale, as they passed through the old hall, arm in arm.
She pinched her husband's are as they entered the oak parlour, where Sir
lot and his wife were ready to receive them. Sir Pitt in black, Lady
Jane in black, and my ITaly Touchdown with a large black head-piece of
bugles and fetlers, which wave on her Lndyship's head like an under-
taker's tray.
Sir Pitt had judged correctly, that she would not quit the premises.
She contented herself by preserving a solemn and stony silence, when in
company of Pitt and his rebellious wife, and by frightening the children in
the nursery by the ghastly gloom of her demeanour. Only a very faint
bending of the head-dress anl plumes welcomed Rawdon and his wife, as
those prodigals returned to their family.
to say the truth, they were not affected very much one way or other by
this coolness. Her Ladyslip, strange to say, was a person only of secondary
consideration in their minds just then-they were intent upon the reception
which the reigning brother and sister would afford them.
Pitt with rather a heightened colour went up and shook his brother by
the hand; and saluted llebeccn with a hand-shake and a very low bow.
But Ludy Jane took both the hands of her sister-in-law and kissed her
affectionately. The embrace somehow brought tears into the eyes of the
little adventuress-which ornaments, as we know, she wore very seldom.

Rawdon, encouraged by this demonstration on his sister's part, twirled up
lis pistachios, and took leave to salute Lady Jane with a kiss, which
caused her Ladyship to blush exceedingly.

his wife were together again. 'Pitt's got fat too, and is doing the thing

handsomely.  He can afford it,'' said Rebecca, and agreed in her
husband's farther opinion, `" that the mother-in-law was a tremendous old
Guy-and that the sisters were rather well-looking young women,''
They, too, had been summoned from school to attend the funeral
ceremonies. It seemed Sir itt Crawley, for the dignity of the house
and family, in thought right to have about the place as many persons in
black as could possibly be assembled. All the men and maids of the
house, the old women of the Alms House, whom the elder Sir Pitt had
cheated out of a great portion of their due, the arish clerk's family, nd
the special retainers of both 1All and ectory were painted in subtle;
added to these, the undertaker's men, at least a score, with crepes and hat-
bands, and who made a goodly show when the great burying show took
place-but these are mute personages in our drama, and having nothing to
do or say need occupy a very little space here.
With regard to her sisters-in-laws rebecca did not attempt to forget her
former position of Governess towards them, but recalled it frankly and
kindly, and asked them about their studies with great gravity, and told
them that she had thought of them many and many a day, and longed to
know of their welfare. In fact you would have supposed that ever since
the nd left them she had not ceased to keep them uppermost in her
thoughts, and to take the attendees interest in their welfare. So supposed
Lady Crawley herself and her young sisters.
She's hardly changed since eight years,'' sid Miss rosalind to Miss
Violet, as they were preparing for dinner.
Those red-haired women look wonderfully well,'' replied the other.
 Her's is much darker than it was; I think she must dye it,'' Miss
Rosalind added. ` She is stouter, too, and altogether improved,'' con-
tinted Miss rosalind, who was disposed to be very fat.
At least she gives herself no airs, and remembers that she was
our Governess once,'' Miss Violet said, intimating that it betitted all
governesses to keep their proper place, and forgetting altogether that she
was granddaughter not only of Sir Walpole Crawley, but of Mr. Dawson
of Sudbury, and so had a coal-scuttle in her scutcheon. There are other
very well-meaning people whom one meets every day in Vanity lair, who
are surely equally oblivious.
 It can't be true that the girls at the Rectory said, that her mother
was an era-danger-''
'A person can't help their birth,'' Rosalind replied with great life-
reality. `And I agree with our brother, that as she is. in the family, of
course we are bound to notice her. I am sure Aunt Bute need not talk:
she wants to marry kate to young cooper, the wine-merchant, and
absolutely asked him to come to the Rectory for orders.''
`I wonder whether Lady Shutdown will go away, she looked very
glum upon Mrs. Rawdon,'' the other said.
 I wish she would. I won't read the  Washerwoman of Pinochle
Common,''' vowed Violet; and so saying, and avoiding a passage at the
end of which a certain coffin was placed with a couple of winters, and
light perpetually burning in the closed room, these young women came
down to the family dinner, for which the bell rang as usual.

ANY FAIR.
But before this, Lady Jane conducted Rebecca to the apartments pre-
red for her, which with the rest of the house had assumed a very much
improved appearance of order and comfort during Pitt's regency, and
here beholding that MIrs. Rawdon's modest little trunks had arrived, and
were placed in the bed-room and dressing-roon adjoining, helped her to
take off her neat black bonnet and cloak, and asked her sister-in-law in
what more she would be useful.
 What I should like best,'' said Rebecca, ``would be to go to the
nursery ; and see your dear little children'' On which the two lakes looked
very kindly at each other, and went to that apartment hand in hand.
lucky admired little Matilda, who was not quite four years of, as the
most charming little more in the world; and the boy, a little fellow of two
years-pale, heavy-eyed, and large-headed, she pronounced to be a perfect
prodigy in point of size, intelligence, and about.
eI wish Mamma wonll not insist on giving him so much medicine,''
Lady Jane said, with a sigh. `I often think we should all be better
without it,'' And then Lady Jane and her new-found friend had one of
those confidential medical conversations about the children, which all
mothers, and most women, as I am given to understand, delight in. Fifty
years ago, and when the present writer, being an interesting little boy,
was ordered out of the room with the ladies after dinner, I remember
quite well that their talk was chiefly about their ailments; and putting this
question directly to two or three since, I have always got from them the
acknowledgment that times are not changed. LEt ny fair readers remark
for themselves this very evening when they quit the dessert-table, and
assemble to celebrate the drawing-room mysteries. Well-in half-an-hour
Becky and LAdy Jane were close and intimate friends-and in the course
of the evening her Ladyship informed Sir Pitt that she thought her ne
sister-in-law was a kind, frank, unaffected, and affectionate young
oman.
And so having easily won the daughter's good-will, the indefatigable
little woman bent herself to conciliate the august Lady Touchdown. As
soon as she found her Ladyship alone, Rebecca attacked her on the nursery
question at one, and said that her own little boy was saved, actually
saved, by colonel, freely administered, when all the physicians in Paris
had given the denr child up. And then she mentioned how often she had
heard of Lady Shutdown from that excellent man the Reverend Lawrence
Grills, Minister of the chapel in My Fair, which she frequented; and
how her views were very much changed by circumstances and misfortunes;
and how she hoped that n past life spent in worldliness and error might
not incapacitated her from more serious thought for the future. She described
how in former days sle had been indebted to Mr. Crawley for religions
instruction, touched upon the  Washerwoman of Pinochle Common,'' which
she had real with the greatest profit, and asked about Andy Emily, its
gifted author, now Lady Emily Hornblower, at Cape Town, where her
husband had strong hopes of becoming Bishop of Canarian.
But she crowned nll, and confirmed herself in Lady Touchdown's favor,
by feeling very much agitated and unwell after the funeral, and requesting
her Lalyship's medical advice, which the Dowager not only gave, out,

wrapped up in a bed-gown, and looking more like Lady Macbeth than
ever, came privately in the night to lucky's room, with a parcel of favourite

Becky first accepted the tracts, and began to examine them with great
interest, engaging the Dowager in a conversation concerning them and the
welfare of her soul, by which means she hoped that her body might escape
medication. But after the religious topics were exhausted, Lady Macbeth
would not quit Becky's chamber until her cup of night-drink was emptied
too; and poor Mrs. Rawdon was compelled actually to assume a look of
gratitude, and to swallow the medicine under the unyielding old Dowager's
nose, who left her victim finally with a benediction.
It did not much comfort Mrs. kRawdon; her countenance was very queer
when Rawdon came in and heard what had happened; and his explosions
of laughter were as loud as usual, when Becky, with a fun which she could
not disguise, even though it was at her own expense, described the
occurrence, and how she had been victimised by Lady Touchdown. Lord
Steve, and her son in London, has many a laugh over the story, when
Rawdon and his wife returned to their quarters in May Fir. Becky

acted the whole scene for them. She put on a night-cap and gown. She
preached a great sermon in the true serious manner: she lectured on the
virtue of the medicine which she pretended to administer, with a gravity
of imitation so perfect, that you would have thought it was the Countess's
of Roman nose through which she shuffled. :`Give us Lady Touchdown
and the black dose,'' was a constant cry amongst the folks in Becky's little
drawing-room in My Fair. And for the first time in her life the Dowager
Countess of Touchdown was made amusing.
Sir Pitt remembered the testimonies of respect and veneration which
Rebecca had paid personally to himself in early days, and was tolerably
well disposed towards her. The marriage, ill-advised as it was, had
improved Rnwdon very much--that was clear from the Colonel's altered
habits and demeanour-and had it not been a lucky union as regarded
Pitt himself2 The cunning diplomatic smiled inwarly as he owned that
he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not to
cry out against it. His satisfaction was not covered by Rebecca's own
statements, behaviour, and conversation.
She doubled the deference which before had charmed him, calling out
his conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise Pitt himself,
who, always inclined to respect his own talents, admired them the more when
Rebecca pointed them out to him. With her sister-in-law, Rebecca was satis-
factory able to prove, that it was Mrs. Bute Crawley who brought about
the marriage which she afterwards so calumniated : that it was Mrs. Bute's
avarice-who hoped to win all  Miss Crawley's fortune, and deprive
Rawdon of his aunt's four-which caused and invented all the wicked
reports against Rebecca. `t She succeeded in making us poor,'' Rebecca
said, with an air of angelical patience; ``but how can I be angry with a
woman who has given me one of the best husbands in the world And has
not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the run of her own
hopes, and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?
Poor'' she tried. `Dear Lady Jane, what are we for poverty I am
used to it from childhood, and I am often thankful thal Miss Crawley's
money has gone to restore the splendour of the noble old family of which
I am so proud to be a member. I am sure Sir Pitt will make a much
better use of it than Rawdon would.''
All these speeches were reported to Sir Pitt by the most faithful of
wives, and increased the favourable impression which Rebecca made; so
much so, that when on the third day after the funeral the family party
were at dinner, Sir Pitt Crawley, carving fowls at the head of the table,
actually said to Me. Rawdon, ``AhemI Releeeca, may lI gie you as wing''
-a speech which made the little woman's eyes sparkle with pleasure
While Rebecca was prosecuting the above schemes and hopes, and Pitt
Crawley arranging the funeral ceremonial and other ratters connected
with his future progress and dignity, and Lady Jane busy with her nursery,
as far as her mother would let her, and the sun rising and setting, and the
lock-tower bell of the lIall ringing to dinner and to prayers as usul, the
body of the late owner of queen's Crawley lay in the apartment which he
had occupied, watched unceasingly by the professional attendants who

were engaged for that rite. A woman or two, and three or four under-
taker's men, the best whom Southampton could furnish, dressed in black,
and of a proper stealthy and tragical demeanour, had charge of the remains
which they watched turn about, having the housekeeper's room for their
place of rendezvous when off duty, where they played at curds in privacy
and drank their beer.
The members of the family and events of the house kent away from
the gloomy spot, where the bones of the descendant of an ancient line of
knights and gentlemen, lay awaiting their final consignment to the family
crypt. No regrets attended them, sae those of the poor woman who had
hoped to be Sir Pitt's wife and willow, and who had fled in disgrace from
the Hall over which she had so nearly been a ruler. Beyond her and a
favorite old pointer he had, and between whom and himself an attachment
subsisted during the period of his imbecility, the old man had not a single
friend to mourn lim, having indeed, during the whole course of his life,
never taken the least pains to secure one. Could the best and kindest of
us who depart from the earth, have an opportunity of revisiting it, I
suppose he or she (assuming that any Vanity Fair feelings subsist in the
sphere whither we are bound) would have a pang of mortification at finding
how soon or survivors were consolced. And so Sir pItt was forgotten-
like the kindest and best of us-only a few weeks sooner.
Those who will may follow his remains to the grave, whether they were
born on the appointed day, in the most becoming manner, the family in
black coaches, with their hnndkerchiefs up to their noses, ready for the
cars which did not come: the undertaker and his gentlemen in deep
tribulation : the select infantry mourning out of compliment to the new
landlord: the neighbouring gentry's carriages nt three miles an hour,
empty, and in profound uflliction: the parson speaking out the formula
about `` our lear brother departed,'' As long as we have a man's body,
we play our Vunities upon it, surrounding it with hubug and ceremo-
ties, laying it in state, and parking it up in gilt nails and velvet ; and we
finish our duty by placing over it a stone, written all over with lies,
Bute's crate, a smart young fellow from Oxford, and Sir PItt Crawley,
composed between them in appropriate Latin epitaph for the late lamented
Baronet: and the former preached a classical sermon, exhorting the sur-
vivors not to give way to grief, and informing them in the most respectful
terms that they also would be one day called upon to pass that gloomy
and mysterious portal which he just closed upon the remains of their
lamented brother. Then the pedantry mounted on horseback again, or
stayed and refreshed themselves at the Crawley Arms. Then, after a
lunch in the servant's hall at ucen's Crawley, the gentry's carriages
wheeled off to their different destinations: then the undertaker's men,
taking the ropes, calls, velvets, ostrich feathers, and other mortuary pro-
parties, clambered up on the roof of the hearse, and rode off to South-
hampton. Their faces relapsed into a natural expression as the horses,
clearing the lodge-gates, got into a brisker trot on the open road; and
squads of them might have been seen, speaking with black the public-
house entrances, with pewter-pots flashing in the sunshine. Sir Pitt's
invalid-chair was wheeled away into a tool-house in the garden: the old

pointer used to hol sometimes at first, but these were the only accents of
grief which were heard in the Hall of which Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet, had
been master for some three-score years.
As the birds were pretty plentiful, and partridge-shooting is as it were
the duty of an English gentleman of statesman-like propensities, Sir Pitt
Crawley, the first shock of grief over, went out a little and partook of that
diversion in a white hat with a crape round it. The sight of those fields
of stubble and turnips, now his own, gave him many secret joys. Some-
times, and with an exquisite humility, he took no gun, but went out with
a peaceful bamboo cane; Rawdon, his big brother, and the keepers blazing
away at his side. Pitt's money and acres had a great effect upon his
brother. The penniless Colonel became quite obsequious and respectful
to the head of his house, and despised the milk-sop Pitt no longer.
Rawdon listened with sympathy to his senior's prospects of planting and
draining: gave his advice about the stables and cattle, rode over to Mud-
bury to look at a mare which he thought would carry Lady Jane, and
offered to break her: &c: the rebellious dragoon was quite humbled and
subdued, and became a most creditable younger brother. He had constant
bulletins from Miss Briggs in London respecting little Ruwdon, who was
left behind there: who sent messages of his own. ``I am very well,'' he
wrote. I hope you are very well. I hope MNamma is very well. The
pony is very well. Grey takes me to ride in the Park. I can canter.
I get the little boy who role before. He tried when he easterly. I do
not cry.'' Rawdon real these letters to his brother, and Lady Jane, who
was delighted with them. The Baronet promised to take charge of the
law at school; and his kind-hearted wife gave Rebecca a bank-note, beg-
ging her to buy a present with it for her little nephew.
One day followed another, and the ladies of the house passed their life
in those calm pursuits and amusements which satisfy country ladies.
Bells rang to meals, and to prayers. The young ladies took exercise on
the piano-forte every morning after breakfast, Rebecca giving them the
benefit of her instruction. Then they put on thick shoes and walked in
the park and shrubberies, or beyond the pilings into the village, descending
upon the cottages, with Lady Touchdown's medicine and tracts for the
sick people there. Lady Touchdown drop out in a pony-chaise, when
rebecca would take her place by the Dowager's side, and listen to her
solemn talk with the utmost interest. She sang Handel and Haydn to
the family of evenings, and engaged in a large piece of worsted work, as
if she had been born to the business, and as if this kind of life was to
continue with her until she should sink to the grave in a polite old age,
leaving regrets and a great quantity of console behind her-as if there were
not cares and dus, schemes, shifts, and poverty, waiting outside the Park
gates, to pounce upon her when she issued into the world again.
It isn't difficult to be a country gentleman's wife,'' Rebecca thought.
I think I could be a good woman if I had fie thousand a year. I could
dnwdle about in the nursery, and count the apricots on the wall. I could
water plants in a green-house, and pick off dead leaves from the geraniums.
l would ask old women about their rheumatism, and order half-a-crown'a

worth of soup for the poor. I shouldn't miss it much, out of five thou-
sand s year. I could even drive out ten miles to dine at a neighbor's,
and dress in the fashion of the year before last. I could go to church
and keep awoke in the great family pew: or go to sleep behind the
curtains, and with my veil down, if I only had practice. I could pay
everybody, if I had but the money. This is what the conqueror here
pride themselves upon doing. They look down with pity upon us miserable
sinners who had none. hey think themselves generous if they give our
children in five-pound note, and us contcmptible if we are without one.''
And who knows but Rebecca was right in hcr speculations-and that it
was only a question of money and fortune which made the difference
between her and an honest woman If you take temptations into account,
who is to say that he is better than his neighbour? A comfortable career
of prosperity, if it does not make people honest, at least keeps them so.
An alderman coming from a turtle feast will not step out of his marriage to
steal a leg of mutton ; but put him to starve, and see if he will not print:

the distribution of good and evil in the world.
The old haunts, the old fields and tools, the copies, pounds and gardens,
the rooms of the old house where she had spent a couple of years seven
years ago, were all carefully revisited by ler. She had been young there
or comparatively so, for she forgot the time when she ever was young-
but she remembered her thoughts and feelings seven years back, and con-
trusted them with those which she had at present, now that she had seen
the world and live with great people, and raised herself far beyond her
original humble station.
I have passed beyond it because I have brains,'' Becky thought,
`and almost all the rest of the world are fools. I could not go back, and
consort with those people now, whom I used to meet in my father's studio.
Lords come up to my door with stars und gurters instead of poor artists
with screws of tobacco in their pockets. I have a gentleman for my
husband, and an eArl's daughter for my sister in the very house where I
was little better than a servant a few years go. But am I much better
to donor in the world than I was when I was the poor painter's daughter,

had married Francis who is so fond of me-I couldn't have been much
poorer than I am now. lEigh I wish I could exchange ny position
in society, and all my relations for a snug sum in the three per Cent.

it was in those- securities that she would have liked to cast anchor.
It may, perhaps, have struck her that to have been honest and humble,
to have done er duty, and to have marched straightforward on her way,
would have brought her as near happiness as that path by which she was
striving to attain it. But,-just as the children at Queen's Crawley went
round the room, where the body of their father lay ;-if ever Becky had
these thoughts, she was accustomed to walk around them, and not look in.
She eluded them, and despised them-or at least she was committed to
the other path from which retreat was now impossible. And for my part
I believe that remorse is the least active of all a man's moral senses-the

Yery easiest to be weakened when weakened: and in some never weakened
at all. We grieve at being found out, and at the idea of shame or punish-
ment; but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people unhappy in
Vanity Fair.
So Rebecca, during her stay at queen's Crawley, made as many friends
of the Mammon of Unrighteousuess as she could possibly bring under
control. Lady Jane and her husband made her farewell with the warmest
demonstrations of good will. They looked forward with pleasure to the
time when the family-house in Gaunt Street being repaired and beautified;
they were to meet again in London. Lady Touchdown made her up a
packet of medicine, and sent a letter by her to the Rev, Lawrence Grills,
exporting that gentleman to save the brand who ``honoured'' the letter
from the burning. Pitt accompanied them with four horses in the carriage
toMudbury, having sent on their baggage in a cart previously, accompanied
with lands of game.
 How happy you will be to see your darling little boy again,'' Lady
Crawley said, taking leave of her kinswoman.
O so happy l'' said Rebecca, throwing up the green eyes. She was
immensely happy to be free of the place, and yet loth to go. queen's
Crawley was abominably stupid; and yet the air there was somehow
purer than that which she had been accustomed to breathe. Everybody
had been dull, but nhl been kind in their way. ``It is all the influence of a
long course of three per Cents,'' Becky said to herself, and was right very
likely.
Iiowvever, the London lamps flashed joyfully as the stage rolled into
Piccadilly, and Briggs had made a beautiful fire in Curzon Street, and
little Rawdon was up to welcome back his papa and mamma.

wC TREATS OF TIE OSBORNE FAMILY.

WE'
ONSIDFERAII.E time has elapsed since we have seen
our respectable friend, old Mr, Osborne of Russell
Square. He has not been the happiest of mortals
since last we met him. Events have occurred which
have not improved his temper, and in more instances
than one he has not been allowed to have his own
way. To e thwarted in this reasonable desire was
always very injurious to the old gentleman; and
resistance became doubly exasperating when gout,
age, loneliness, and the force of any disappoint-
ments combined to weigh him down. His stiff black hair began to grow
quite white soon after his son's death; his face grew redder; his hands them-
bled more and more as he poured out his glass of port wine. lIe led his
clerks a dire life in the city: his family at home were not much happier.
I doubt if Rebecca, whom we have seen poultry praying for Console,
would have exchanged her poverty and the dure-devil excitement and
chances of her life, for Shore's money and the human gloom which
envelopes him. He had proposed for Miss Swartz, but had been rejected
scornfully by the partisans of that lady, who muriel her to a young sprig
of Scotch nobility. He was a man to he married a woman out of low
life, and buried her dreadfully afterwards: but no person presented herself
suitable to his taste; and instead, hc tyranuised over his untnarricl daughter
at home. She had a fine carriage and fine horses, and state at the head of
a table loaded with the grandest plate. She had a cheque-book, n prize
footman to follow her when she walked, unlimited credit, and bows and
compliments from all the tradesmen, and all the appurtenacees of an
heiress; bnt she spent n woful time. Tho little charity-girls at the Found-
ling, the sweepers at the crossing, the poorest under-kitchen-said in the
servant's hall, was happy compared to that unfortunate and now middle-
aged young lady.
Frederic Bullock, Esq., of the house of Bullock, Huber, and Bullock, hal
married aria Osborne, not without a great deal of difficulty and grumbling
on Mr. Bullock's part. George being dead and cut out of his father's
will, Frederic insisted that the half of the old gentleman's property should
be settled upon his Maria, and indeed, for a long time, refused ' to come to
the scratch'' (it is Mr. Frederick's own expression) on any other terms.
Osborne said Fred had agreed to take his daughter with twenty thousand,
and he should bind himself tono more.  TIred might take it, and welcome,
or leave it, and go and be hanged.'' Fred, whose lopes and been raised

when George had been disinherited, thought himself infamously swindled
by the old merchant, and for some time made as if he would break off the
match altogether. Osborne withdrew his account from Bullock and
Husker's, went on Change with a horsewhip which he swore he would ls
across the back of a certain scoundrel that should be nameless, and
demeaned himself in his usual violent manner. Jane Osborne condoned
with her sister Maria during this family feud. ``I always told you,
Maria, that it was your money he loved, aul not you,'' she said soothingly.
He selected me and my money at any rate: he didn't choose you and

partners counselled him to take MAria, even with the twenty thousand
settled, hlf down, and half at the death of Mr. Osborne, with the changes
of the further division of the property. So he ``knuckles down,'' again
to use his own phrase; and sent old Hulker with peaceable overtures
Osborne. I was his father, he said, who would not hear of the match,
and had made the difficulties; he was most anxious to keep the engage-
ment. The excuse was usually accepted by Mr. Osborne. Hulker and
Bullock were a high family of the city aristocracy, and connected with the
jobs'' at the West End. It was something for the old man to be able to
say `MY son, Sir, of the house of FIlkers, Bullock, and Co., Sir; my caught-
ter's cousin, Ludy MAry MInngo, Sir, daughter of the Right Hon. the eArl
of Castlemeuldy.'' In lis migration he saw his house people by the
``jobs.'' So he forgave young Bullock, and consented that the marriage
should take place.
It was a grand affair-the bridegroom's relatives giving the breakfast,
their habitations being near St. George's Hanover Square, where the
business took place. The ``jobs of the West End,'' were invited, and
many of them signed the book. Mr. Mango and Lady Mary Mango were
there, with the dear young Gwendoline and Engineer MAngo as brides-
maids; Colonel Bludyer of the Dragoon Guards (eldest son of the house
of Bludyer Brothers, Mincing Lue), another cousin of the bridegroom,
and the Honourable Mrs. Bludyer; the Honourable George Boulder, Lord
Levant's son, and his lady, Miss Mango that was; Lord Viscount Castle-
today; Honourable James CuLl and Mrs. MeRRill (formerly Miss
Swartz), and a host of fashionable, who he all married into Lombard
Street, and done a great deal to ennoble Cornhill.
The young couple had a house near Berkeley Square, in a small villa at
Roehampton, among the banking colony there. Fred was considered to
have made rather a mnesalliauece by the ladies of his family, whose grand-
father had been in a Charity School, and who were allied through th
husbands with some of the best blood in England. And Maria was
bound, by superior pride and great care in the composition of her visiting-
book, to make up for the defeats of birth; and felt it her duty to see the
father and sister as little as possible.
That she should utterly break with the old man, who had still so many
scores of thousand pounds to give away, is absurd to suppose. Free
Bullock would never allow her to do that. But she was still young and
incapable of hiding her feelings: and by inviting her papa and sister to

her third-rate parties, and behaving very coldly to them when they came,
and by avoiding Russell Square, and discreetly begging her father to quit
that olious vulgar place; she did more harm than all Frederick's diplo-
macy could repair, and enrolled her chance of her inheritance like a giddy
needless creature as she was.
So Russell Square is not good enough for Mrs. Marias, hay?'' said
the old gentleman, rattling up the carriage-windows, as he and his daughter
drove away one night from MIrs. Frederick Bullock's, after dinner. `` So
she invites her father and sister to a second day's dinner (if those sides, or
country, as she calls 'cm, weren't served yesterday, I'm d-l), and to meet
City folks and lottery men, and keeps the Euros, and the Ladies, and the
Honourable to herself. Honoursblcs? Dam Honourable. I am a
plain British merchant I am: and could buy the regularly hounds over
and over. Lords, indeed l-why, at one of her swarreys I saw one of 'em
speak to a dam toddler-a cellar I despise. And they won't come to
Russell Square, won't they Why, I 'I1 ly my life I've got a better
glass of wine, and pay a better figure for it, and can show a handsome
service of silver, and cn lay a better dinner on my mahogany, than ever
they see on theirs-the cringing, sneaking, stuck-up fools. Drive on
quick, James; I want to get bnek to Russell Square-ha, hal'' and he
sank back into the corner with a furious laugh. With such reflections on
his own superior merits, it was the custom of the old gentleman not
frequently to console himself.
Lane Osborne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her
sister's conduct; and when Mrs. Frederick's first-born, Frederic Augustus
Howard Stanley Devereux Bullock, was born, old Osborne, who was
invited to the christening and to be godfather, contented himself with
sending the child a gold cup, with twenty guineas inside it for the nurse.
That's more than any of your Lords will give, I 'll arrant,'' he said,
and refused to attend at the ceremony.
The splendour of the gift, however, caused great satisfaction to the
house of Bullock. Maria thought that her father was very much pleased
with her, and Frederic augured the best for his little son and heir.
One can fancy the pangs with which Miss Osborne in her solitude in
Russell Square read the ' Morning Post,'' where her sister's name occurred
every now and then, in the articles ended '' Fashionable Reunions,'' and
where she had an opportunity of reading a description of Mrs, F. Bullock's
costume, when presented at the drawing-room by Lady Frederica Bullock.
June's own life, as we have said, admitted of no such grandeur. It was an
awful existence. She had to get up of black winter's mornings to make
breakfast for her scowling old father, who would have turned the whole
house out of doors if his ten had not been realy at halt-past eight. She
remained silent opposite to him, listening to the urn hissing, and sitting in
tremor while the parent read his paper, and consumed his accustomed
portion of muffins and tea. At lnlf-past nine he rose and went to the
City, and she was almost free till dinner-time, to make visitations in the
kitchen and to scold the servants: to drive nbrond and descend upon the
tradesmen, who were prodigiously respectful : to leave her cards and her
papa's at the great glum respectable houses of their City friends; or to sit

alone in the large drawing-ro, creating visitors; and working at a
huge piece of worsted by the fire, on the sofa, hard by the great lIpligenia
select, which tiered and tolled with mournful loudness in the dreary room.
The great glass over the mantel-piece, faced by the other great console
glass at the opposite end of the room, increased and multiplied between
them the brown lolland bag in which the chandelier hung; until you saw
these brown Holland bags fading away in endless perspectives, and this apart-
ment of Mass Osborne's seemed the centre of a system of drawing-rooms.
When she removed the cordon leather from the grand piano, anal ven-
turned to play a few notes of it, it sounded with a mournful sadness,
startling the dismal echoes of the house. George's picture was gone, and
laid up-stairs in a lumber-roo in the garret; and though there was a
consciousness of him, and father and daughter often instinctively knew
that they were thinking of him, no mention was ever made of the rare
and once durling son.
At five o'clock Mr. Osborne came back to his dinner, which he and his
daughter took in silence (seldom broken, except when he swore and was
savage, if the cooking was not to his liking), or which they shared twice in
a month with a party of dismal friends of Osborne's rank and age. Old
r. Gulp and his lady from Bloomsbury quark: old Mr. Browser, the
attorney, from bEdford Low, a very great man, and from his business,
and-in-love with the ``jobs at the WEst End :'' old Colonel Livermore, of
the Bombay Ary, and Mrs. Livermore, from Upper Bedford Place  old
Berjeant otfy and Mrs. Toffy ; and sometimes old Sir Thoms Coffin and
Lady Coffin, from Bedford Square. Sir `Thomas was celebrated as a
hanging judge, and the particular tawny port was produced when he dined
with Mr. Osborne.
These people and their like gae the pompous Russell Square merchant
pompous dinners back again. They had solemn rubbers of whist, when
they went up-stairs after drinking, and their carriages were called at half-
past ten. Many rich people, whom we poor devils are in the habit of
cnvying, lend contentedly an existence like that above described. Jane
Osborne scarcely ever met a man under sixty, and almost the only bachelor
who appeared in their society was Mr. Smirk, the celebrated Lady'doctor.
I can't say that nothing had occurred to disturb the monotony of this
awful existence : the fact is, there had been a secret in poor lane's life
which had made her father more savage and morose than even nature,
pride, and over-feeding had made him. This secret was connected with
Miss Wirt, who had a cousin an artist, MIr. Smee, very celebrated since as
a portrait-painter and In,A., but who once was glad enough to give
drawing-lessons to ladies of fashion. Mr. Sce has forgotten where Rus-
sell Square is now, but he was glad enough to visit it in the year 1818,
when Miss Osborne had instruction from him.
Smee (formerly n pupil of share of Frith Street, a dissolute, irregular,
and unsuccessful in, but a man with gret knowledge of his art) being
the cousin of Miss WVirt, we say, and introduced by her to Miss Osborne,
whose hand and heart were still free after various incomplete love affairs,
felt a great attachment for this lady, and it is believed inspired one in her
bosom. Miss Wirt was the confidante of this intrigue. I know not
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
383
whether she used to leave the room where the master and his pupil were
painting, in order to give them an opportunity for exchanging those vows
and sentiments which cannot be uttered advantageously in the presence of
a third party: I know not whether she hoped that should her cousin
succeed in carrying off the rich merchant's daughter, he would give Miss
Wirt a portion of the wealth, which she had enabled him to win-all that
is certain is, that Mr, Osborne got some hint of the transaction, come
back from the City abruptly, and entered the drawing-room with his
bamboo cane; found the painter, the pupil, and the companion all looking
exceedingly pale there; turned the former out of doors with menaces that
he would break every bone in his skin, and half-an-hour afterwards dis-
missed Miss Wit likewise, kicking her trunks down the stairs, trampling on
her and-boxes, and shaking is fist at her lackey coach, as it bore her
away.
Jane Osborne kept her had-room for many days. She was not allowed
to have a companion afterwards. Her father swore to her that she should
not have a shilling of his money if she made any match without his con-
currence; and as he wanted a woman to keep his house, he did not choose
that she should marry : so that she was obliged to give up all projects
with which Cupid had any share. During her papa's life, then, she resigned
herself to the manner of existence here described, and was content to be
an Old Mid. Her sister, meanwhile, was having children with finer names
every year-and the intercourse between the two grew fainter continually.,
``Jane and I do not move in the same sphere of life,'' Mrs. Bullock said.
 I regard her as a sister, of course''-which means-what does it mean
when a lady says that she regards Jane as a sister
It has been described how the Misses Dobbin lived with their father at
a fine villa nt Denmark Hill, where there were beautiful graperies and
peach-trees which delighted little Georgy Osborne. The Misses Dobbin,
who drove often to Brompton to see our dear Amelia, came sometimes to
Russell Square too, to pay a visit to their old acquaintance Miss Osborne.
I believe it was in consequence of the commands of their brother the Major
in India (or whom their papa had a prodigious respect), that they payed
attention to Mrs. Genre; for the Major, the godfather and guardian of
Amelia's little boy, still hoped that the child's grandfather might be
induced to relent towards him, and acknowledge him for the sake of his
son. The Miss Dobbins kept Miss Osborne acquainted with the state of
Amelia's affairs; how she was living with her father and mother: how
poor they were : how they wondered what men, and such men as their
brother and dear Captain Osborne, could find in such an insignificant little
chit: how she was still, as heretofore, a namby-party milk-and-water
affected creature-but how the boy was really the noblest little boy ever
seen-for the hearts of all women warm towards young children, and the
surest spinster is kind to them.
One day, after great entreaties, on the part of the Misses Dobbin, Amelia
allowed little George to go and pass a day with them at Denmark IIill-a
part of which day she spent herself in writing to the Major in India. She
congratulated him on the happy news which his sisters had just conveyed

to her. She prayed for his prosperity, and that of the bride le had chosen.
She thanked him for a thousand thousand kind offices and proofs of sted-
fast friendship to her in her affliction. She told him the last news about
little Georgy, and how he was gone to spend that very day with his sisters
in the country. She underlined the letter a great deal, and she signed
herself affectionately his friend, Amelia Osborne. She forgot to send any
message of kindness to Ldy O'Dowd, as her wont was-and did not
mention Gloria by name, and only in italics, as the Major's ride, for
whom she begged blessings. But the news of the marriage removed the
reserve which she had kept up towards him. She was glad to be able to
own and feel how warmly and gratefully she regarded him-and as for the
idea of being jealous of Gloria, (Gloria, indeell) Amelia would have
scouted it, if an angel from heaven had hinted it to her.
That night, when Georgy came back in the pony-carriage in which he
rejoiced, and in which he was driven by Sir Wm. Dobbin's old scotsman,
he had round his neck a fine gold chain and watch. He said an old ldy,
not pretty, had given it him, who cried and kissed him a great deal. Bit
he didn't like her. He liked grapes very much. Ad he only liked his
mamma. Amelia shrunk and started: the timid soul felt a presentiment
of terror when she heard that the relations of the child's father had
seen him.
Miss Osborne came back to give her father his dinner. He had made
a good speculation in the City, and was rather in a good humour that day,
and changed to remark the agitation under which she laboured. ee What's
the matter, Miss Osborne'' he deigned to say.
The woman burst into tears. ` O, Sir,'' she said,  I'e seen little
George. He is as beautiful as an angel-and so like him' The old man
opposite to her did not say a word, but flushed up, and began to tremble
in every limb.

impetuous in temper; eager to command: a tyrant over her Michael: a
dragon amongst all the ladies of the regiment : a mother to all the young
men, he she tends in their sickness, legends in all their scrapes, and with
hom Ldy l'guy is immensely popular. But the Subalterns' and Captains'
ladies (the Major is unmarried) cuba against her a good deal. lies so
that Gloria gives herself airs, and that Peggy herself is intolerable doug-
needing. Bhe interfered with a little congregation which Mrs. Kirk had got
np, and laughed the young men away from her sermons, stating that a
soldier's wife had no business to be a person: that Mrs. Kirk would
be much better mending her husband's clothes: and, if the regiment
wanted sermons, that she had the finest in the world, those of her uncle,
tho dEan. She abruptly put a termination to a flirtation which Lieutenant
Stubble of the regiment had commenced with the Surgeon's wife, threatening
to come down upon Stable for the money which he had borrowed from
her (for the young fellow was still of an extravagant turn) unless e broke
off at once and went to the Case, on sick leave. On the other hand,
she housed and sheltered Mrs. sky who fled from her bungalow one
night, pursued by ler infuriate husband, wielding his second brandy
bottle, and actually carried Porky through the delirium streets, and broke
him of the bit of drinking, which had grown upon that officer as all evil
habits ill grow upon men. In a word, in adversity she was the best of
comforters, in good fortune the most troublesome of friends; having a
perfectly good opinion of herself always, and un indomitable resolution to
have her own way.
Among other points, she had made up her mind that Gloria should
marry our old friend Dobbin, MIrs. O'Dowd knew the Major's expects-
tions and appreciate lis good qualities, and the high character which he
enjoyed in his profession. Gloria, a very handsome, freshcoloured,
black-haired, blue-eyed young lady, who could ride a horse, or play a sonata
with any girl out of the County Cork, seemed to be the very person destined
to insure Dobbin's happiness-much more than that poor good little weak-
spur'ted Amelia, about whom he used to take on so.-'` Look at Gloria
enter a room,'' Mrs. O'Down would say, '`and compare her with that
poor Mrs. Osborne, who couldn't say no to a goose. She'd be worthy of
you, Major-you're a quiet man yourself, and want some one to talk for
ye. And though she does not come of such good blood as the Falcons
or Molloys, lct me tell ye, she's of an ancient family that any nobleman
might be proud to marry into.''
But before she had come to such a resolution, anl determined to sub-
jugate Major Dobbin by her endearments, it must be owned that Gloria
mal practised them a good dcul elsewhere. She had had a season in
Dublin, and who knows how many in Cork, Killarney, and Mellow She
nd flirted with all the marriageable officers whom the depots of her
country afforded, and all the bachelor squires who seemed eligible. She
had been engaged to be married a half score times in Ireland, besides the

clergyman t Bath who used her so ill. She hal flirted all the way to
Madras with the Captain and chief-mate of :he llamclunder Best Adiyaman,
and had a season at the Presidency with her brother and MIrs, O'Dowd
who was staying there, while the Major of the regiment as in command
at the station. Everybody admired her there: viceroy danced with
her: but no one proposed who was worth the marrying; one or two exceed-
singly young subalterns sighed after her, and a heartless civilian or two;
but she rejected these as beneath her pretensions; and other and younger
virgins than Glorvinn were married before her. There are women, and
handsome women too, who have this fortune in life. They fall in love
with the utmost generosity ; they ride and walk with half the Ary-list,
though they drs near to forty, and yet the MIss O'Grades are Miss
O'Gralys still : Gloria persisted that but for Lady O'Dowd's unlucky
barrel with the Judge's ldy, she would have made a good match t
Mudras, where old Mr, Chutney, who was at the head of the civil service,
(and who afterwards married Miss Dolby, n young holy, only thirteen
years of age, who led just arrived from school iu eUrope), was just at the
point of proposing to her.
Well, although Lady O'Dowd and Gloria equalled a great number
of times every day, and upon almost every conceivable subject-since, if
Mike O'Dowd had not possessed the temper of an age, two such women
constantly about his ears would have driven him ont of his senses-yet
they agreed between themselves on this point, that dlorvina should marry
Major Dobbin, and were determined that the Major should have no rest
until rearrangement was brought about. Undismayel by forty or fifty
previous defeats, Gloria laid siege to him. She sang Irish Alelotlies at
him nnceasingly. She asked him so frequently and patletically, will he
come to the bower? that it is a wonder how any man of feeling could
have resisted the invitation. She was never tired of inqiiring, if Sorrow
had his young days failed; and was ready to listen and weep like
bDesdemoaat the stories of his dangers and his campaigns. It has been
said that our honest and year old friend used to perform on the flute in
private: Levi insisted upon having duets with him, and LAdy O'dOwd
would rise and tirelessly quit the room, when the young couple were so
engaged. Gloria forced the Major to ride with her of mornings. The
whole cantonment saw them set out and return. She was constantly
writing notes over to him at his house, borrowing his books, and scoring
with her great pencil-marks nh pa-ages of sentiment or humour as
awakened hcr sympathy. hn borrowed his horses, his servants, his
spoons, and planning;-no wonder that public rumour assigned her to
him, and theatre MAjor's sisters in England should fancy they were about
to have a sister-incas.
Dobbin, who was thus vigorously besieged, was in the meanwhile in a
state of the most odious tranquility. He used to laugh when the young
fellows of the regime joked him about Georgina's manifest attentions to
him. t Bah1'' said he, '`she is only keeping her hand in-she practises
upon me as she does upon Mrs. Tower's piano, because it's the most
handy instrument in the station. I am much too battered and old for
such a fine young lady s Gloria.'' And so he went on riding with hcr,

and copying music and verses into her albums, and playing at chess with
her very submissive; for it is with these simple amusements that some
officers in India are accustomed to while away their leisure moments;
while others of a less domestic turn hunt hogs, and shoot snipes, or
gamble and smoke herodotus, and take themselves to brandy-and-water.
As for Sir Michael O'Dowd, though his Lady and her sister both urged
him to call upon the Major to explain himself, and not keep on torture-
in a poor innocent girl in that shameful wny; the old soldier refused
point-blank to have anything to do with the conspiracy- 'Faith, the
Major's big enough to choose for himself,'' Sir Michael said; `' he'll ask me
when he wants he;''-or else he would turn the matter off jocularly,
declaring '`that Dobbin was too young to keep house, and had written
home to ask love of his mamma.'' Any, he went farther, and in private
communications with his Major, would caution and rally him-crying,
Mind your oi, Dob, my hoy, them girls is bent on mischief-me Lady
as just got a box of gowns from europe, and there 's a pink satin for
Gloria, which will finish ye Dob, if it 's in the power of woman or satin
to move ye.''
But the truth is, neither beauty nor fashion could conquer him. Our
ones friend had but one idea of a woman in his head, and that one did
not in the least resemble Miss Gloria O'Dowd in pink satin. A gentle
little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking,
save when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss
Glorvinn's-a soft young mother tending an infant and beckoning the
Major up with a smile to look at him-a rosy-chicken lass coming sing-
in into the room in Russell Square or hanging on George Osborne's
arm happy and loving-there was but this image that filled our
honest Major's mind by day and by night and reigned over it always.
Very likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Major and formed of her 
there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in england,
and with which William had made away privately, pasting it into the lid
of his desk, and faneying he saw some resemblance to Mrs. Osborne in
the print, whereas 1 have seen it, and can vouch that it is but the picture
of a high-waisted gown with an impossible doll's face simmering over it-
fund, perhaps, Mr. Dobbin's sentimental Amelia was no more like the real
one than this absurd little print which he cherishes. But what man in
love, of us, is better informed -or is he much happier when he sees and
owns his inclusion Dobbin was under this spell. He did not bother his
friends and the public much about his feelings, or indeed lose his natural
zest or appetite on account of them. His head has grizzled since we saw
him last; and a line or two of silver may be seen in the soft brown hair
likewise. But his feelings are not in the least changed or ordered; in
his love remains as fresh, as a man's recollections of boyhood are.
WE have said how the two Miss Dobbins and Amelia, the Majors
correspondents in Europe, wrote him letters from England; Mrs. Osborne
congratulating him with great candour and cordiality upon his approaching
nuptials with MIss O'Dowd.

and most sacred, and supersede all others, yet that I am sure the widow
and the child whom you have ever protected and loved will always Iaea a
corner is your heart.'' The letter which has been before alluded to, went
on in this strain, protesting throughout as to the extreme satisfaction of
the writer.

This letter, which arrived by the very same slip which brought out Andy
O'Dowd's box of millinery from London, (and which you may be sure Robin
 opened before any one of the other packets which the mail brought him),
put the receiver into such a state of mind that Gloria, and her pink
satin, and everything belonging to her became perfectly odious to him.
The Major cursed the talk of women : and the sex in general. Every-
thing annoyed him that day-the parade was insufferably hot and were-
some. Good heavens was a man of intellect to waste his life, day after
390
MANY FAIR.
day, inspecting cross-belts, and putting fools through their manoeuvres
The senseless chatter of the young men t mess was more than ever jarring.
What cared he, a man on the high road to forty, to know how many
snipes Lieutenant Smith had shot, or what were the performances of
Ensign Brown's mare The jokes about the table filled him with shame.
He was too old to listen to the banner of the assistant-surgeon and the
slang of the youngsters, at which old O'Dowd, with his hand head and
red face, laughed quite easily. The old man had listened to those jokes
any time these thirty years-Dobbin himself had been fifteen years hearing
them. And after the boisterous dullness of the mess-table, the quarrels
and scandal of the ladies of the regiment It was unbearable, shameful.
eO Amelia, Anglia,'' he thought, `` you to whom I have been so faithful,-
you reproach mel It is because you cannot feel for me, that I drag on
this wearisome life. And you reward me after years of devotion by
giving me your blessing upon my marriage, forseooth, with this counting
Irish girl'' Sick and sorry felt poor William: more than ever wretched
nand lonely. He would like to have done with life and its vanity alto-
gather-so rootless and unsatisfactory the struggle, so sheerness anl dreary
the prospect, seemed to him. He lay all that night sleepless, and yearn-
ing to go home. Amelia's letter had fallen as a blank upon him. No
fidelity, no constant truth and passion, could move her into warmth. She
could not see that he loved her. Tossing in his bed, he spoke out to
her. ``good God, Melting'' he said, ``don't you know that I only love
you in the world-you, who are a stone to me-you, whom I tended
through months and months of illness and grief, and who made me fare-
well with a smile on your face, and forgot me before the door shut between
us1'' The native servants lying outside his verandahs beheld with
wonder the MAjor, so cold and quiet ordinarily, at present so passionately
moved and cast down. Would she have pitied him had she seen him?
He read over and over all the letters which he ever and from her-letters
of business relative to the little property which he had made her believe
her husband had left to her-brief notes of invitation-every scrap of
writing that she had ever sent to him-how cold, how kind, how hope-
less, how selfish, they were
Had there been some kind gentle soul near at hand who could read and
appreciate this silent generous heart, who knows but that the reign of Amelia
might have been over, and that friend William's love might have flowed
into a kinder channel But there was only Gloria of the jetty ringlets
with whom lis intercourse was familiar, and this dashing young woman
was not bent upon loving the MAjor, but rather on making the Major
admire her-a most vain and hopeless task to, at least considering the
means that the poor girl possessed to carry it out. She hurled her hair
and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say, did he ever see such
jet ringlets and such a complexion sHe grinned at him so that he might
see that every tooth in her head was sound-and he never heeded all
these charms. Very soon after the arrival of the box of millinery, and
perhaps since in honour of it, LAdy O'Down and the ladies of the King's
Regiment give a ball to the Company's Regiments and the civilians at

the station. Gloria sported the killing pink froek, and the Mayor, who
attended the party and walked very ruefuly up and down the rooms,
never so much as perceived the pink garment. Gloria danced past him
in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station, and the Major was
not in the least jealous of her performance, or angry because Captain
Bnngles of the Cavalry handed her to supper. - It was not jealousy, or
frocks or shoulders, that could move him, and Florins had nothing
more.
So these two were each exemplifying the Vanity of this life, and cach
longing for what he or she could not get. Gloria cried with rage at
the failure. She had set her mind on the Major ``more than on any of
the others,'' she owned, sobbing. "` He 'll break my heart, he will, Peggy,''
she would whimper to her sister-in-law when they were good friends;
`` sure every one of me frocks must be taken in-it's such a skeleton I 'm
growing.'' Fat or thin, Fighting or melancholy, on horseback or the
music-stool, it was all the same to the Major. And the Colonel, puffing
his pipe and listening to those complaints, would suggest that Glory
should have some black frocks out in the next box from London, and told
a mysterious story of a lady in Ireland who died of grief for the loss of
her husband before she got were a one.''
While the MInor as going on in this tantalizing way, not proposing,
and declining to fall in love, there came another ship from europe bringing
letters on board, and amongst them some more for the heartless man.
These were home letters bearing nu earlier post mark than that of the former
packets, and no Major Dohbin recognised among his, the handwriting of
his sister, who always crossed and crossed her letters to her brother,
--gathered together all the possible bad news which she could collect,
abused him and send him lectures with sisterly frankness, and always left
him miserable for the day after '' dearest William'' had achieved the peru-
sal of one of her epistles-the truth must be told that, nearest William
did not hmrc himself to break the seal of Miss Dobbin's letter, but united
for a particularly favourable day and tool for doing so. A fortnight
before, moreover, he had written to scold her for telling those absurd
stories to MIrs. Osborne, and had despatched a letter in reply to that lady,
undeceiving her with respect to the reports concerning him, and assuring
her that '` he had no sort of present intention of altering his condition.''
Two or three nights after the arrival of the second package of letters, the
Major nhl passed the evening pretty cheerfully at Ludy O'Dowd's house,
where Gloria thought that he listened with rather more attention than
usual to the Meeting of the Waters, the MInstrel Boy, and one or two
other specimens of song with which she favoured him, (the truth is, he was
no more listening to Gloria that to the howling of the nickalls in the
moonlight outside, and the delusion was her's as usual,) and having
played his game at chess with her, (cribbage with the surgeon was Lay
O'Dowd's favourite evening pastie,) Major Dobhin took leave of the
Colonel's family at his usual hour, and retired to his own house.
Where on his table, his sister's letter lay reproaching him. IIe took
it up, ashamed rather of his negligence regarding it, and prepared
himself for a disagreeable hour's communing with that grabbed-handed

. It may have been an hour after the MAjor's
departure from the Colonel's house-Sir Michael ws sleeping the sleep of
the just; Gloria had arranged her black singlets in the innumerable
little bits of paper, in which it was her habit to confine then; Lady
(O'Dowd, too, had gone to her bed in the nuptial chamber, on the ground-
floor, and had tucked her mosquito curtains round her fair form, when
the guard at the gates of the Commanding-officer's compound, beheld
MAjor Dobbin, in the moonlight, rushing towards the house with a swift
step and a very agitated countenance, and he passed the sentinel and
went up to the windows of the Colonel's bed-chamber,
O'Dowd-Colonel'' said Dobbin, and kept up a great shouting.
Heavens, Meteor'' ssid Gloria of the curl-papers, putting out her
head too, from her window.
e What is it, Dob, me boy'' said the Colonel, expecting there was a
are in the station, or that the route had come from head-quarters.
e I-I must have leave of absence. I must go to England-on the
most urgent private affairs,'' Dobbin said.
Good heavens, what has happened'' thought Gloria, trembling
with all the papillons.
i want to be off-now-to-night,'' Dobbin continued ; and the
Colonel getting up, came out to parley with him.
In the postscript of Miss Dobbin's cross-letter-the Major has just
come upon a paragraph, to the following effect :- I drove yesterday to
see your old acquaintance, Mrs. Osborne. The wretched place they live at,
since they were bankrupt, you know-Mr. S., to judge from a brass plate
on the door of his but (it is lktle better) is a coal-merchant. The little
of, your godson, is certainly a fine child, though forward, and inclined
to be saucy and self-willem. But we have taken notice of him as you with
it, and have introduced him to his aunt, Miss O., who was rather pleased
with him. Perhaps his grandpapae, not the bankrupt one, who is almost
voting, but Mr. Osborne, of russell Square, may be induced to relent
towards the child of your friend, lis erring and fulfilled son. And
Amelia will not be ill-disposed to give it up. The widow is consoled,
and is about to marry a reverend gentleman, the Res. Mr. Binney, one of
the curates of HRBrompton. A poor match. But Mrs. O. is getting old,
and I saw a great deal of gray in her hair-she was in very good spirits:
and your little godson overate himself at our house. Mamma sends her
love with that of your affectionate, Ann Dobbin.''

catchment which had been placed there as a
token of mourning for Sir Pitt Crawley's demise,
yet this heraldic emblem was in itself a very
splendid and gaudy piece of furniture, and all
the rest of the mansion became more brilliant
than it had ever been during the late baronet's
reign. The black outer-coating of the bricks was
removed and they appenrcl with n cheerful blush-
ing face streaked with white: the old bronze lion
of the knocker were gilt handsomely, the railings
painted, and the smallest house in Great Gaunt
Street, became the smartest in the whole quarter,
before the green leaves in hampshire had replaced
those yellowing ones which were on the trees in
queen's Crawley avenue when old Sir Pitt Craw-
ley passed under them for the last time.
MA little woman, with a carriage to correspond,
was perpetually seen about this mansion; an
elderly spinster, accompanied by a little boy,
also might be remarked coming thither daily.
It was Miss Briggs and little Rawdon, whose busi-
ness it was to see to the inward renovation of Sir Pitt's house, to super-
intend the female band engaged in stitching the blinds and hangings, to
poke and rummsge in the drawers and cupboards crammed with the dirty
relics anl cougregated trumperies of a couple of generations of Ldy
Crawleys, and to take inventories of the china, the glass, and ole
properties in the closets and store-rooms.
Mrs. Hawlon Crawley was general-in-chief over these arrangements,
with full orders From Sir Pitt to sell, barter, conflict, or present furni-
ture : and she enjoyed herself not a little in an occupation which gave full
scope to her taste an ingenuity. The renovation of the house s dates-
mined upon when Sir Pitt came to ton in November to see his lyere.
and when he passed nearly a week in Curzon Street, under the roof of his
affectionate brother and sister.
He had put up at an hotel at first; but, Becky as soon as she heard of
the Baronet's arrival, went off alone to greet him, and returned in an hour
to Kuron Street with Sir Pitt in the carriage by her side. t ee iee

were they pressed, so frankly and amiably offered. Becky seized Pitt'a
hand in a transport of gratitude when he agreed to come. `Thank you,''
she said, squeezing it, and looking into the Baronet's eyes, who ambushed
good deal 'how happy this will make Rawdon.'' She bustled up about
to Pitt's bed-room, leading on the servants, who were carrying his trunks
thither. She came in herself laughing, with a coal-scuttle out of her

A fire was blazing already in Sir Pitt's apartment, (it was Miss Brigg
room, by the way, who was sent up stairs to sleep with the mid.)
i knew I should bring you,'' she said, with pleasure beaming in her
glance. Indeed, she was really and sincerely happy at having him for a
guest.
Becky made Rawdon dine out once or twice on business, while Pitt
stayed with them, and the Baronet passed the happy evening alone with
her and Briggs. She went down stairs to the kitchen and actually cooked
little dishes for him.  Isn't it a good asylum2'' she said;  I made it for
you. I can make you better dishes than that: and will when you come
to see me,''
Everything you do, you do well,'' said the Baronet gallantly.  The
sami is excellent indeed.''
` A poor man's wife,'' Rebecca replied gaily, ``must make herself useful,

you know:'' on which her brother-in-law vowed that `` she was fit to be
the wife of an emperor, and that to be skilful in domestic duties wss
surely one of the most charming of woman's qualities,'' And Sir Pitt
thought with something like mortification of Lady Jane at home, and of a
certain pie which she had insisted upon making, and serving to him at
dinner-a most abominable pie.
Besides the sami, which was made of LOrd Steyne's phesants from his
lordship's cottage of Stillbrook, Becky gse her brother-in-law a bottle of
white wine, some that Rawdon had brought with him from France, and had
picked up for nothing, the little story-teller said; whereas the liquor was,
in truth, some White HErmitage from the Marquis of Steyne's famous
cellars, which brought fire into the Baronct's pallid cheeks and a grown into
his feeble frame.
Then, when he had drunk up the bottle of exit via land she gave lim
her hand and took him up to the drawing-room, and made him snug on
the sofa by the fire, and let him talk as she listened with the tenderness
kindly interest, sitting by him, and hemming n shirt for her denr little
boy. Whenever Mrs. Rawdon wished to be particularly humble and
virtuous, this little shirt used to come out of her work-box. It had got
to be too small for Rawdon long before it was finished, though.
WEll, rebecca listened to him, she talked to him, she sang to him, she
coaxed him, and cuddlel him, so that he found himself more and more
glad every day to get back from the lawyer's at Gray's Inn, to the blazing
fire in Curzon Street-a gladness in which the men of law likewise parti-
created, for Pitt's harangues were of the longest-and so that when he
went away he felt quite a png at departing. How pretty she looked
kissing her land to him from the carriage and waving her handkerchief
when he had taken his place in the mail She put the handkerchief to
her eyes once. lIe pulled his speaking cnp over his, as the coach drove
away, and, sinking back, he thought to himself how sle respected him and
how he deserved it, and low Rawdon was a foolish dull fellow who didn't
half appreciate his wife: and how mum and stupid his own wife was
compared to that brilliant little Becky. Becky had hinted every one of
these things herself, perhaps, but so delicately and gently, that you hardly
knew when or where. And, before they parted, it was agreed that the
house in London should be redecorated for the next season, and that the
brothers' families should meet again in the country at Christmas.
I wish you could have got  little money out of him,'' Rawdon said to
his wife modify when the bAronet was gone. I should like to give
something to old Raggles, hanged if I should'nt. It in'a right, you know,
that the old fellow should be kept out of all his money. It may be icon-
lenient, and he might get to somebody else besides us, you know.''
tEll lim,'' said Becky, ``that as soon as Sir Pitt's affairs are settled,
everybody will be paid, and give him a little something on account.
Here's a clock that Pitt left for the boy,'' and she took from her bag and
gave her husband a paper which his brother and handed over to her, on
behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys.
The truth is, she had tried personally the ground on which her husband
expressed a wish that she should venture-tried it ever so delicately, and
396
ANY AIR.
found it unsafe. Been at a hint about embarrassments, Sir Pitt Crawley
was off and alarmed. And he began a long speech, explaining how
threatened he himself was in money matters; how the tenants would not
pay; how lis filer's affairs, and the expenses attendant upon the demise
of the old gentleman, had involved him; how he wanted to pay off ineum-
branches; and how the bankers and agents were overrun; and Pitt
Crawley ended by making a compromise with his sister-in-law, and giving
her a very small sum for the benefit of her little boy.
Pitt knew how poor his brother and his brother's family must be. It
could not have escaped the notice of such a cool and experienced old diplo-
maoist, that Rawdon's family had nothing to live upon, and that houses
and carriages are not to be kept for nothing. He knew very well that he
was the proprietor or appropriator of the money, which, according to all
proper calculation, ought to have fallen to his younger brother, and he had,
we may be sure, some secret pangs of remorse within him, which warned
him that he ought to perform some act of justice, or, let us say, compels-
tion, towards these disappointed relations. A just, decent an, not without
brains, who said his prayers, and knew his catechism, and did his duty
outwardly through life, he could not be otherwise than aware that some-
thing was due to his brother at his hands, and that morally he was
Rawdon's creditor.
But, as one ends in the columns of the Ones newspaper every now
and then, queer announcements from the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Acknowledging the receipt of E50 from A. B., or El0 from W. T., as
conscience-money, on account of taxes due by the said A. B. or WY. T.,
which payments the penitents beg the Right Honourable gentleman to
acknowledge through the medium of the public press;-so is the Chan-
cello no doubt, and the reader likewise, always perfectly sure that the
move-named A. B. and W', T, are only paying a very small instalment
of what they really owe, and that the man who sends up a twenty pound-
note has very likely hundreds or thousands more for which he ought to
recount. Such, at least, are my feelings, when I see A. B. or W. T.'a
insufficient acts of repentance. And I have no doubt that Pitt Crawley's
contrition, or kindness if you will, towards his younger brother, by whom
he had so much profited, was only a very small dividend upon the capital
sum in which he was indebted to Rawdon. Not everybody is willing to
pay even so much. To part with money is a sacrifice beyond almost all
men endowed with a sense of order. There is scarcely any man alive
who does not think himself meritorious for giving his neighbour five pounds.
Thriftless gives, not from a beneficent pleasure in going, but from a lazy
delight in spending. He would not deny himself one enjoyment ; not his
opera-stall, not his horse, not his dinner, not even the pleasure of giving
Lazarus the five pounds. Tlrifty, who is good, wise, just, and owes no
man a penny, turns from a beggar, haggles with a hackney-coaching, or
denies a poor relation, and I doubt which is the most selfish of the two.
Money has only a different value in the eyes of each.
So, in a word, Pitt Crawley thought he would do something for his
brother, and the thought that he would think about it some other
time.

And with regard to Becky, she was not a woman who expected too
much from the generosity of her neighbours, and so was quite content
with all that. Pitt Crawley had done for her. She was acknowledged by
the head of the family. If litt would not give her anything, he would
get something for her some day. If she got no money from her brother-
in-law, she got what was as good as money,-credit. Ragglcs was made
rather easy in his mind by the spectacle of the union between the brothers,
by a small payment on the spot, and by the promise of a much larger
sum speedily to be assigned to him. And Rebecca told Miss riggs,
whose Christmas dividend upon the little su lent by her, Becky paid
with nn nir of candid joy, and as if her exchequer was brimming oven
with gold-Rebecca, we say, told Miss Briggs, in strict confidence, that
she had conferred with Sir Pitt, who was famous as a financier, on bRiggs's
special behalf, as to the most profitable investment of Miss B,'s remain-
in capital; that Sir Pitt, after much consideration, had thought of a most
safe and advantageous way in which Briggs could lay out her money;
that, being especially interested in her as an attached friend of the late
Miss Crawley, all of the whole film, and the long before he left town, he
had recommended that she should be ready with the money at a moment's
notice, so as to purchase at the most favourable opportunity the shares
which Sir Pitt had in his eye. Poor Miss Briggs was very grateful for
this mark of Sir Pitt's attention-it came so unsolicited, she said, for she
never should have thought of removing the money from the ends-and
the delicacy enhanced the kindness of the office; and she promised to see
her man of business immediately, and be ready with her little cash at the
proper hour.
And this worthy woman was so grateful for the witness of Rebecca in
the matter, and for that of her generous benefactor, the Colonel, that she
went out and spent a great part of her half year's dividend in the purchase
of a black velvet cont for little Rawdon, who by the way was grown almost
too bi for black velvet now, and was of a size and age bcfitting him for
the assumption of the virile object and pantaloons.
IIe was a fine open faced boy, with blue eyes and waving flaxen hair, sturdy
in limb, but generous and soft in heart: fondly attaching himself to all who

man)-to the groom who had charge of the pony-to Molly, the cook, who

especially, whose attachment towards the lad was curious too to witness.
klere, as he grew to be about eight years old, his attachments may be
said to have ended. The beautiful mother-vision hal faded away after
a while. During near two years she had scarcely spoken to the child.
She disliked him. He had the measles and the hooping-cough. He
bored her. One day when he was standing at the landing-place, having
crept down from the upper regions, attracted by the sound of his mother's
voice, who was singing to Lord Steyne, the drawing-room door opening
suddenly, discovered the little spy, who but a moment before had been
rapt in delight, and listening to the music.

HIs mother came out and struck him violently a couple of boxes on the
ear. IIe heard a laugh from the Marquess in the inner room, (he was
useful by this free and artless exhibition of Becky's temper,) and fled
down below to his friend of the kitchen, bursting in an agony of grief.
 It is not because it hurts me,'' little Rawdon gasped out-``only-
only''-sobs and tears wound up the sentence in a storm. It was the
little boy's heart that was bleeding.  Why my't I hear her singing:
Why don't she ever sing to me-as she does to that bald-headed man

matious of rage and grief. The cook looked at the housemaid: the
housemaid looked knowingly at the footman-the awful kitchen inqui-

After this incident, the mother's dislike increased to united; the con-
seriousness that the child was in the house was a reproach and a pin to
er. 1lis very sight annoyed her. Fear, doubt, and resistance sprung
up, to, in the boy's own bosom. They were separated from that day of
the boxes on the ear.
Lord Steyne also heartily disliked the boy. When they met by his-
chance, he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child, or glared at him
with savage-looking eyes. Rawdon used to stare him in the face, and
double his little fists in return. He knew his enemy; an this gentle-
man, of all who came to the house, was the one who angered him most.
One day the footman found him squaring his fists at Lord Steyne's late
in the hall. The footman told the circumstance as a good joke to Lord
Steyne's coaching; that officer imparted it to Lod tyne's gentleman,
and to the servants' hall in general. And very soon afterwards, when
Mrs. Rawdon Crawley made her appearance at Guant House, the porter

And, I shame to say, she would not have got credit had they not
believe her to be guilty. It was the sight of the Marquis of Steyne's
carrying-lamps at her door, contemplated by Ragglcs, burning in the black-
ness of midnight, `` that kept him up,'' as he afterwards said; that, even
more than llcbeeca's arts and coatings.
And so-guiltless very likely-she was writing and pushing onward
towards what they call ``'a position in society,'' and the servants were
pointing at her as lost and ruined. So you see Molly the housemaid of n
morning, watching a spider in the door-post lay his three and laloriously
crawl up it, until, tired of the sport, she raises her broom and sweeps away
the thread and the artificer.
A day or two before Christmas, becky, hcr husband and her son made
ready and went to pass the holidays at the seat of their ancestors at
Queen's Crawley. Becky would have liked to leave the little brent behind,
and would but for Lady Jane's urgent invitations to the youngster; and
the symptoms of revolt and discontent which Rawdon manifested at her
neglect of her son. He's the finest boy in England,'' the father said, in
a one of reproach to her, `" and you don't seem to care for him, Becky, as
much as you do for your spaniel. Ie shan't bother you much: at home
he will be away from you in the nursery, and he shall go outside on the
coach with me.''
Where you go yourself because you want to smoke those filthy cigars,''
replied Mrs. Rawdon.
 I remember when you liked 'em though,'' answered the husband.
Becky laughed: she was almost always good-humoured.  hat was
when I was on my promotion, Goose,'' she said. `` Take Rawdon outside
with you, and give him a cigar too if you like.''
Rawlon did not warm his little son for the winter's journey in this
way, but he and Briggs wrapped up the child in shawls and comforters,
and he was hoisted respectfully on to the roof of the couch in the dark
morning, under the lamps of the White Horse Cellar: and with no small
delight he watched the dawn rise, and made his first journey to the place
which his father still called home. It was a journey of infinite leisure
to the boy, to whom the incidents of the road aforlel endless interest;
his father answering to him all questions connected with it, and telling
him who live in the great white house to the right, and whom the park
belonged to. His mother, inside the vehicle with her maid and her furs,
her wrappers, and her scent bottles, made such a to-do that you would
have thought she never had been in a stage enoch before-much less, that
she had been turned out of this very one to make room for a paying
passenger on a certain journey performed some half-score years ago.
It was dark again when little Rawdon was weakened up to enter is
uncle's carriage at Sudbury, and he sate and looked out of it wondering
as the great iron gates flew open, and at the white trunks of the limes as
they swept ly, until they stopped, at length, before the light windows of
the HAll, which were blazing and comfortable with Christmas welcome.

the old Turkey one that used to be in the Ladies' Gallery,'' thought
rebecca, and the next instant was kissing Lady Jane.
She and Sir Pitt performed the same salute with great gravity : but
Rawdon having been smoking, hung back rather from his sister-in-law,
whose two children came up to their cousin; and, while Matilda held out
her hand and kissed him, Pitt Binkie Solution, the son and heir,
stood aloof rather, and examined him as a little dog does a big dog.
Then the kind hostess conducted her guests to the snug apartments
laying with cheerful fires. Then the young ladies came and knocked at
MIrs. Rawdon's door, under the pretence that they were desirous to be
useful, but in reality to have the pleasure of inspecting the contents of her
bank and bonnet-boxes, and her dresses which, though black, were of the
news I.orndon fashion. And they told her how much the Hall was changed
for the better, and how old Lady Touchdown was gone, and how Pitt was
taking his station in the country, as became a Crawley in fact. Then the
great dinner-bell having rung, the family assembled at dinner, at which
meal lawson Junior was placed by his aunt, the good-natured lady of the
house; Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his sister-in-law at his
own right hand.
Little Million exhibited a fine appetite, and showed a gentlemanliks
behaviour.
I Like to dine here,'' he said to his aunt when he had completed his
car, at the conclusion of which, and after a decent grace by Sir Pitt, the
young son and air was introduced, and was perched on a high chair by
the barnet's side, while the daughter took possession of the place and
the little wine-glass prepare for her near her mother. `I like to dine
more,'' said Rawdon Minor, looking up at his relation's kind face.
 WAy '' and the good Lady Jane.
:I dine in the kitchen when I am at home,'' replied Rawdon Minor,
`' or else with Briggs.'' But Becky was so engaged with the baronet, her
host, pouring out a flood of compliments and delights and raptures, apd
admiring young Pitt linkie, whom she declared to be the most beautiful,
intelligent, noble looking little creature, and so like his father, that she did
not hear the remarks of her own flesh and blood at the other end of the
brond shining table.
As a guest, and it being the first night of his arrival, Rawdon the Second
was allowed to sit up until the hour when tea being over, and a great gilt
hook being laid on the table before-Sir Pitt, all the densities of the family
streamed in, and Sir Pitt read prayers. It was the first time the poor
little boy had ever witnessed or heard of such a ceremonial.
The house had been much improved even since the Baronet's brief reign,
and was pronounced by Becky to be perfect, charming, delightful, when
she surveyed it in his company. As for little Rawdon, who examined it
with the children For his guides, it seemed to him a perfect palace of
enchantment and wonder. There were long galleries, and ancient state-
bed rooms, there were pictures and old china, and armour. There were
the rooms in which Grandpa died, and by which the children walked
with terrified looks. ee Who was Grandpa ?'' he asked; and they told

house in which it had in since the old gentleman had been wheeled
away yonder to the church, of which the spire was glittering over the
park elms.
The brothers had good occupation for several mornings in examining the
improvements which had been effected by Sir Pitt's genius and economy.
And as they walked or rode, and looked at them, they could talk without
too much boring each other. And Pitt took care to tell Rawdon what as
heavy outlay of money these improvements had oeeasioned; and that
a man of landed and funded property was often very hard pressed for
twenty pounds. There is that new lodge gate,'' sail Pitt, pointing to it
humbly with the bamboo one, ``I can no more pay for it before the
dividends in January the I can fly.''
`I can lend you, Pitt, till then,'' Rawdon answered rather ruefully;
and they went in and looked at the restored lodge, where the family arms
were just new scraped in stone; and where oll Mrs. Look, for the first
time these many long yers, had tight doors, sound roofs, and whole
widows.

the HAmpshire public, subscribed handsomely to the county charities,
called assiduously upon all the county folks, and laid himself out in a
word to take that position in Hampshire, and in the Empire afterwards,
to which he thought his prodigious talents justly entitled him. Lady Jane
was instructed to be friendly with the Fuddlestones, and the SNapshots,
and the other famous bayonets, their neighbours. Their carriages might
frequently be seen in the Queen's Crawley avenue now; they dined pretty
frequently at the IIall (where the cookery was so good, that it was clear
Lady Jane very seldom had a hand in it), and in return Pitt and his wife
most energetically dined out in all sorts of weather, and at all sorts of
distances. For though Pitt did not care for viability, being a frigid man
of poor health and appetite, yet he considered that to be hospitable and
condescending was quite incumbent on his station, and every time that he
got a headache from too long an after-dinner sitting, he felt that he as
a martyr to duty. He talked about crops, corn-laws, politics, with the
best country gentlemen. He (who had been formerly inclined to be
a sad freethinker on these points) entered into poaching and game pre-
serving with ardonr. He didn't hunt: he wasn't a hunting man: he
 s a man of books and peaceful habits: but he thought that the breed
of horses must be kept up in the country, and that the breed of foxes

preaching in public and attending meeting-houses; went shortly to

and made no objection when the Venerable Archdencon Trumpet asked
for a sumo of whist. What pangs must have been those of INdy
Touchdown, and what in utter cast-away she must have thought her
son-in-law for permitting such a godless diversion and when, on the
return of the family from an oratorio at Winchester, the RBaronet
announced to the young ladies that he should next year very probably
take them to the county balls.'' They worshipped him for his kind-
ness. Lady Jane was only too obedient, and perhaps glad herself to
go. The dOwager wrote off' the direst descriptions of her daughter's
worldly behaviour to the nuthloress of the ` Wnsherwoman of Finally
Common'' at the Cape; and her house in brighton being but this time
unoccupied, returned to that watering-place, her absence being not very
much deplorcd by her children. We may suppose, too, that rebecca, on
paying a second visit to queen's Crawley, did not feel particularly grieve
at the absence of the lady of the medicine-chest; though she wrote a
Christmas letter to her ladyship, in which she respectfully recalled herself
to Lady South's recollection, spoke with gratitude of the delight
which ler ladyship's conversation had given her on the former visit,
dilatel on the kindness with which her ladyship had treated her in sick-
ness, and declared that everything at queen's Crowley reminded her of
cr absent final.
A great part of the altered demeanour and popularity of Sir Pitt
Crawley right hue been traced to the counsels of that astute little lady
of Curzon 5recent. `` Io remain n baronet-you consent to be a mere
country gentleman,'' she said to him, while he had been her guest in
London. t No, Sir itt Crawley, I know you better. I know your
talents and your ambition. ou fancy you hide them both: but you cnn
conceal neither from me. I showed Lord Steyne your pamphlet on malt.
IIe was familiar with it: and said it was in the opinion of the whole Cabinet
the most masterly thing that had appeared on the subject. The Ministry
has its eye upon you, and I know what you want. you want to dustin-
guise yourself in parliament; every one says you are the finest speaker in
England (for your speeches at Oxford are still remembered.) You want to
be Member for the County, where with your own vote and your borough
at your back, you c command anything. And you want to be BAron
Crawley of queen's Crawley, and will be before you lie. I saw it all. I
could rend your heart, Sir 1itt. If I had a husband who possessed your
intellect as he does your name, I sometimes think I should not be unworthy
of him-but-but I am your kinswomn now,'' she added with a laugh.
Poor little penniless I have got a little interest-and who knows, perhaps
the mouse may be able to aid the lion,''
Pitt Crawley was amazed and enraptured with her speech. ``DOwn the
woman comprcheuls mel'' he said. ``I never could get Anne to read these
pages of the malt-pamphlet. Sle las no idea that I have commanding
talents or secret ambition. So they remember my speaking at Oxford, do
they? The rascalsl now that I represent my borough and may sit

some one at last. as, the man was always the same whom these people
elected: it was only the opportunity that was wanting, and I will show
them on that I can speak and not as well as write. Achilles did not
declare himself until they gave him the sword. I hold it now, and the
world small yet hear of Pitt Crawley.''
Therefore it was that this roguish diplomats had grown so hospitable;
that he was so civil to oratorios and hospitals; so kind to Deans and
Chapters; so generous in giving and accepting dinners; so uncomnonly
gracious to farmers on market-days; and so much interested about county
business; and that the Christmas at the IIall was the eldest which had
been known there for many a long day.
On Christmas day a great family gathering took place. All the Craw-
leys from the ectory came to dine. greece was as frank and fond of
Mrs. Bute, as if the other had never been her enemy, affectionately
interested in the der girls, and surprised at the progress which they had
nale in music since her time: and insisted upon encoding one of the
lets out of the great song-books which Jim, grumbling, had been forced
to bring under his arm from the energy. Mrs. Bute, performed, was
obliged to adopt a decent demeanour towards the little adventuress-of
course being free to discourse with er daughters afterwards about the
absurd respect with which Sir Pitt treated his sister-in-law. But Jim, who
had sat next to her at dinner, declared she was a trump: and one and all
of the Rector's family agreed that the little Rawlon ws a one boy. They
respected a possible baronet in the boy, between whom and the title there
was only the little sickly pale Pitt Binkie.
The children were very good friends. Pitt Binkle was too little a dog
for such a big dog as Rawlon to play with : and MAtilda being only a
girl, of course not fit companion for a young gentleman who was near eight
years old, and going into jackets very soon. He took the command of
this small party at once-the little girl and the little boy following him
but with great reference at such times as he condescended to sport
with them. His happiness and pleasure in the country were extreme.
he kitchen-garden pleased him hugely, the flowers moderately, but the
pigeons and the poultry, and the stables when he was allowed to visit them,
were delightful objects to him. He resisted being kissed by the Miss
Crawleys: but he allowed Lady Jane sometimes to embrace hin: and
it was by her side that he like to it when the signal to retire to the
drawing-room being given, the ladies left the gentlemen to their claret-
by her side rather than by his mother. For Rebecca seeing that tenderness
was the fashion, called Rawdon to her one evening, and stooped down and
kissed him in the presence of all the ladies.
He looked her full in the face after the operation, trembling and
turning very red, as his wont was when moved. :You never kiss me
at home, Mamma,'' he said; at which there was a general silence and
consternation, and a by no means pleasant look in Becky's eyes.
Rawdon was fond of his sister-in-law, for her regard for his son. Lady
Jane and Becky did not get on it so well at this visit as on occasion of
the former one, when the Colonel's wife was bet upon pleasing. Those

two speeches of the child struck rather a chill. Perhaps Sir Pitt was
rather too attentive to her.
But won, as became his age and size, was founder of the society of
the men than of the women; and never wearied of accompanying his side
to the stables, whither the Colonel retired to smoke his cigar-in, the
Rector's son, sometimes joining lis cousin in that and other amusements.
HIe nd the Baronet's keeper were very close friends, their mutual taste
for ``dawgs '' bringing them much together. On one day, Mr. James,
this Colonel, and llorn, the keeper, went and shot pheasants, taking little
Rawdon with them. On another most blissful morning, these four
gentlemen partook of the amusement of rat-hunting in a barn, as which
sport Radon as yet had never seen acting so noble. They stopped
p the ends of certain drains in the born, into the other openings of which
ferrets were inserted; and then stood silently aloof with uplifted stakes in
their hands, and an anxious little terrier (Mr. James's celebrated `' dawn''
Forceps, indeed,) scarcely breathing from excitement, listening motionless
on three lcgs, to the faint squeaking of the rats below. Desperately
hold nt last, the persecuted animals bolted above-ground: the terror
accounted for one, the keeper for another, Rawdon, from flurry and
excitement missed his rat, but on the other hand he half-murdered n
ferret.
But the greatest day of all was that on which is Huldlestone Fiddle-
stone's hounds mct upon the lawn at queen's Crawley,
That was a famous sight for little awdon. At half-past ten, Tom
Moody, Sir Huddlestoue Fudllestone's huntsman, is seen trotting un the
avenue, followed by the noble pack of sounds in a compact body-the
rear being brought up by the two whips clad in stained scarlet frocks-
light hard-featured laws on well-bred lean horses, possessing marvellous
dexterity in casting the points of their long heavy whips at the thinnest
part of any dog's skin who dares to straggle from the main body, or to
take the slightest notice, or even so much as wink at the hares and
rabbits starting under their nose.
Next comes boy Jack, Tom Moody's son, who weighs five stone, mea-
sure right-and-forty inches, and will never be any bigger. It is perched
on a large raw-boned hunter, half-covered by a capacious saddle. This
animal is Sir luddlestone Fuddlestone's favourite horse-the Nob. Other
horses, ridden by other small boys, arrive from time to time, awaiting their
masters, who will come centering on anon.
Town Moody rides up to the door of the Hall, where he is welcomed by
the butler, who offers him drink, which he declines. He and his peek
then draw off into a sheltered corner of the lawn, where the dogs roll on
the grass, and play or grohl angrily at one another, ever and anon
breaking out into furious fight speedily to be quelled by Tom's voice,
unmatched at rating, or the snaky thongs of the whips.
Many young gentlemen canter up on thorough-bred hacks, sputter-
dashed to the knee, and enter the house to drink cherry-brandy and pay
their respects to the ladies, or more modest and sportsman-like, divest
themselves of their mud-boots, exchange their hacks for their hunters, and
warm their blood by a preliminary gallop round the lawn. Then they

collect round the pack in the corner, and talk with Tom MOody of psst
sport and the merits of Nivelle and DIamond, and of the state of the
country and of the wretched breed of foxes.
Sir IIuddlestone presently appears mounted on a clever cob, and rides
up to the Hall, where he enters and does the civil thing by the ladies,
after which, being a man of few words, he proceeds to business. The
hounds are drawn up to the HInall-door and little Rawdon descends amongst
them, excited yet half alarmed by the caresses which they bestow upon
him, at the thumps he receives from their waving tails, and at their canine
bickering, scarcely restrained by Tom Moody's tongue and lash.
Meanwhile, Sir Hulllestone his hoisted himself unwieldy on the Now:
Let's try Sister's Bpinney, Tom,'' says the Baronet, '' Farmer Mangle
tells me there are two foxes in it.'' Tom blows his horn and trots off,
followed by the back, by the whips, by the young gents from Winchester,
by the farmers of the neighbourhood, by the labourers of the parish on
foot, with whom the day is a great holiday; Sir Hudllestone bringing up
the rear with Colonel Crawley, and the whole cortge disappears down
the avenue.

nvocations with which we find her occupied when this chapter begins.
Under her care the Crawley House in Great Gaunt Street was quite
rejuvenescent, and ready for the reception of Sir Pitt and his family,
when the Baronet came to london to attend his duties in Parliament,
and to assume that position in the country for which his vast genius
fitted him.
For the first session, this profound dissembler hid his projects and never
opened his lips but to present a petition from Sudbury. But he attended
nssiduously iu lis place, and learned thoroughly the routine and business
of the house. At home he gave himself up to the perusal of Blue
Books, to the alarm and wonder of Lady Jane, who thought he was killing
himself by late hours and intense application. And he made acquaintance
with the ministers, and the chiefs of his party, determining to rank as
one of them before many years were oer.
Lady Jane's sweetness and kindness had inspired Rebecca with such a
contempt for her lalyship as the little woman found o small difficulty ir
concealing. That sort of goodness and simplicity which Lady Jane possessed
annoyed our friend Becky, and it was impossible for her at times not to
show, or to let the other divine er scorn. Her presence, too, rendered
Lady Jane uneasy. Iler husband talked constantly with Becky. Signs
of intelligence seemed to pass between them: and Pitt snoke with ler o
subjects on which he never thought of discussing with Id Jane. The
latter did not understand them to be sure, but it was mortifying to remain
silent; still more mortilying to know that you had nothing to say, and
her that little audacious Mrs. Rawdon darling on from subject to sub-
ject, with a word for every man, and a joke always pat; and to sit in
one's own lousealoue, by the fireside, and watching all the men round
your rival.
In the country, when andy Jane s telling stories to the children, who
clustered about her knew, (little Rawdon into the bargain, who was very
fond of her)-and Bucky came into the room, sneering, with green scornful
eyes, poor LAdy Jan green silent nder those balcful glance. Her
simple little fancies shrank away tremuloualy, as fairies in the story-looks,
before n superior bad angel. She could not go on, although Rebecca,
with the smallest inflection of shares in her voice, besought her to con-
tinge that charming story. And on her side, gentle thoughts and simple
pleasures were odious to Mrs. Becky, they discarded with her; she
hated people for liking them; she spurred children and children-lovers.
 I have no taste for brand and butter,'' she would say, when caricnturing
Lady Jane and her ways to my Lord Steyne.
No more has a certain person for holy water,'' his lordship replied with
a bow and a grin, and a great jarring laugh afterwards.
So these two ladies did not see much of each other except upon those
occasions, when the younger brother's wife, having an object to gain from
the other, frequented her. They my-loved and my-cured cach other
assiduously, but keep apart generally: whereas Sir Pitt, in the midst of
his multiplied avocations, found daily time to see his sister-in-law.
On the occasion of his first Speaker's dinner, Sir Pitt took the opfor-
unity of appearing before his sister-in-law in his uniform-that old

diplomatic suit which he had worn when attached to the Pumpernickel
legation.
Becky complimented him upon that dress, and admired him almost as
much as his own wife and children, to whom he displayed himself before
he set out. She said that it was only the thorough-bred gentleman that
could wear the Court suit with advantage: it was only your men of ancient
race whom the culotte court became. Pitt looked down with company-
cency at his legs, which had not, in truth, much more symmetry or swell

When he was gone, Mrs. Becky made a caricature of his figure, which
he showed to Lord Steyne when he arrived. His lordship carried off
the sketch, delighted with the accuracy of the resemblance. He had done

been most gracious to the new barouet and member. Pitt was struck too
by the deference with which the great Peer treated his sister-in-law, by
her ease and sprightliness in the conversation, and by the delight with
which the other men of the party listened to her talk. Lord Steyne made
no doubt but that the baronet and only commenced his career in public
life, and expected rather anxiously to hear him as an orator; as they were
neighbours (for Great Gaunt Street leads into Gaunt Square, whereof Gaunt
House, as everybody knows, forms one side) my lord hoped that as soon
as Lady Steyne arrived in London she would have the honour of making
the acquaintance of Lady Crawley. He left a card upon his neighbour in
the course of n day or two: his neighbour whom he had,.as his prede-
censor, never thought it to notice though they had lived near each other
for near a century past.

were meanwhile passing their
a-


Christmas after their fashion,
and in a manner by no means
too cheerful.
Out of the hundred pounds
a year, which was about the
count of her income, the
widow Osborne had been in
the habit of giving up nearly
three-fourths to her father
and mother, for the expenses
of herself and her little boy.
With A120 more, supplied
by Jos., this family of four
people, attended by a single
Irish servant who also did for
Clapp and his wife, might
manage to live in decent com-
for through the year, and hold up their heads yet, an be able to give
friend a dish of ten still, after the storms and disappointments of their
carly life. Sedley still maintained lis ascendancy over the family of
Ir. Clapp, his ex-clerk. Clapp remembered the time when, sitting on
1the edge of the chair, he tossed off a bumper to the health of ` Mrs.S---,
liss Emmy, and Mr. Joseph in India,' at the merchant's rich table in
russell Square. Time magnified the splendour of those recollections in the
honest clerk's bosom. Every time he ce up from the kitchen-parlour
to the drawing-room, and partook of tea or gin-and-water with Mr. Sedley,
he would say, '` This was not what you was accustomed to once, Sir,'' and
ns gravely and reverentially drink the health of the ladies as he and
one in the days of their utmost prosperity. He thought Miss 'lelia's
playing the divest music ever performed, and or the finest lady. He
ever would sit down before Sedley at the club even, nor would he have
that gentleman's character abused by any member of the society. He
has seen the first men in London shaking hands with Mr. S-; he
said, `` He'd known lim in times when Rothschild might be seen on Change
with him any day, and he owed him personally everything.''
Clapp, with the best of characters and hand-writings, had been able cry
soon after his master's disaster to find other employment for himself.

4I1
 Such a little fish as me cnn swim in any bucket,'' he used to remark,
and a member of the house from which old Sedley had seeded was very
glad to make use of Mr, Clapp's services, and to reward them with a com-
portable salary. In fine, all Sedley's wealthy friends had dropped off
one by one, and this poor ex-dependent still remains faithfully attached
to him.
Out of the small residue of her income, which Amelia kept back for
herself, the widow had need of all the thrift and care possible in order to
enable her to keep her darling boy dressed in such a maker ns became
George Osborne's son, and to defray the expenses of the little school to
which, after much misgivings and reluctance, and many secret pngs and
fears on her own part, she had been induced to scud the and. Sue and
save up of nights conning lessons and spelling over grabbed grammars and
geography books in order to teach them to Georgy. She had worked
even at the Latin accident, fondly hoping that she might be capable of
instructing him in that language. To part with him all day: to send
him out to the mercy of n schoolmaster's case and his schoolfellows'
roughness, was almost like weaning him over again, to that weak mother,
so tremulous and full of sensibility. CHIc, for his part, rushed off to the
school with the utmost happiness. He was longing for the change. That
childish glndness wounded his mother, who was herself so grieved to part
with him. She would rather have nhl hi more sorry, she thought : and
then was deeply repentant within herself, for during to be so selfish ns to
wish her own son to be unhappy.
Georgy made great progress in the school, which was kept by a friend of
his mother's constant admirer, the Res. Mr, Binney. IIe brought ome
numberless prizes and testimonials of ability. IIe told his mother count-
less stories every night about his school-companions: and what a fine
fellow Lyons was, and what s sneak Sniffing was: and how Steel's father
actually supplied the meat for the establishment, whereas Golding's mother
came in a carriage to fetch him every Saturday : and how Cent had straps
to his browsers,-might he have straps and how Bull Major was so strong
(though only in Lutropius) that it was hclievet le could lick the Usher,
Mr, Ward himself. So Amelia learned to know every one of the boys in
that school as well as Georgy himself: and of nights she used to help him
in his exercises and puzzle her little head over his lessons as eagerly us if
she was herself going in the morning into the presence of the master.
Once, after a certain combat with Master Smith, George cmc home to his
mother with a black eye, and brngged proligiously to his parents and his
delighted old grandfather about his valour in the fight, in which, is the
truth was known, he did not behave with particular heroism, and in which
he decidedly had the worst. But Amelia has never forgiven that Smith
to this day, though he is now a peaceful apothecary near Leicester
Square.
In these quiet labours and harmless cares the gentle widow's life was
passing away, a silver hair or two marking the progress of time on her
head, and a line deepening ever so little on her fair fourteen.. Lie used

great, famous, and glorious, as he desired to be. She kept his copy-
books, his drawings, and compositions, and showed them about in Ilnr
little circle, as if they were circles of genius. She confided some of
these specimens to Miss Dobbin : to slow them to Miss Osborne, George's
aunt, to show them to Mr. Osborne himself-to make that old rcn
repent of his cruelty and ill-feeling towards him who was gone. All her
husband's faults and foibles she had buried in the grave with him: she
only remembered the lover, who had married her at all sacrifices : the
noble husband so brae and beautiful, in whose nrms she had hung on
the morning when he had gone away to fight, and die gloriously for his
king. From heaven the hero must be smiling down upon that paragon
of a boy whom he had left to comfort and console her.
We have seen how one of George's grandfathers (Mr. Osborne), in
his easy chair in Russell Square, daily grew more violent and moody,
and how his daughter, with her fine carriage, and her fine horses, and
her name on half the public charity-lists of the town, was a lonely,
miserable, persecuted old maid. She thought again and again of the
beautiful little boy, her brother's son, whom she had seen. She longed
to be allowed to drive in the fine carriage to the house in which he lived:
and she used to look out day after day as she took her solitary drive in
the Park, in hopes that she might see him. Her sister, the banker's lady,
occasionally condescended to pay her old home and companion a visit in
russell Square. He brought a couple of sickly children attended by a
prim nurse, and in a faint genteel giggling tone tackled to her sister
about her five acquaintance, and how her little Frederick was the image of
Lord Claud Lollipop, and hcr sweet Maria had been noticed by the
Baroness as they were driving in their donkey-chaise at Roehampton.
She urged her to make her papa do something for the dnrlings. Fre-
derick she had determined should go into the Guards ; and if they made
an elder son of him (ud Mr. Bullock was positively ruining and pinching
himself to death buy land), how was the ruling girl to be provided for

which kind of speeches, in which fashion and the main change were
blended together, and after a kiss, which was like the contact of an
oyster-Mrs. Frederick Bullock would gather her searched nursing, and
simper back into her carriage.
Every visit which this leader of on paid to her family was more unlucky
for her. Her father paid more money into Stumpy and Rowley's. Her
patronage became more and more insufferable. The poor widow in the
little cottage at Brompton, guarding her treasure there, little new how
eagerly some people coveted it.

On that night when Jane Osborne had told her father that she had
seen his grandson, the old man had made her no reply: but he had
shown no anges-anl and made her good night on going himself to his
room in rather a kindly voice. And he must have meditated on what she
said, and have made some inquiries of the Dobbin family regarding her
visit; for a fortnight after it took place, he asked her where was her little
French watch and chain she used to wear?
I bought it with my money, Sir,'' she said in a great fright.
Go and order another like it, or a better if you can get it,'' said th
oll gentleman, and lapsed again into silence.
Of late, the Miss Robins more than once repeated their entreaties to
Amelia, to allow george to visit them. His aunt had shown her incline-
tion; perhaps his grandfather himself, they hinted, might be disposed to
be reconciled to him. Surely, Amelia could not refuse such advantageous
chances for the boy. Nor could she : but she acceded to their overtures
with s very heavy and suspicious heart, was always uneasy during the
child's absence from her, and welcomed him back as if he was rescued out
of some danger. He brought back money and toys, at which the widow
looked with alarm and jealousy: she asked him always if he had seen any
gentleman-`` Only old Sir William, who drove him about in the four-
wheeled chaise, and Mr. Dobbin, who arrived on the beautiful bay horse in
the afternoon-in the green coat and pink neck-cloth, with the gold-headed
whip, who promised to show him the Tower of London, and take him out
with the Surrey hounds.'' Mt last, he said  There was an old gentleman,
with thick eye-brows and a broad hat, and large chain and seals. He came
one day as the cochrane was lunging Gdeorgy round the law on the grey
pony. He looked at every much. He shook very much. I said' My
name is Norval' after dinner. My aunt began to cry. She is always
crying.'' Such was George's report on that night.
Then Amelia knew that the boy had seen his grandfather: and looked
ont feverishly for a proposal which she was sure would follow, and which
came, in fact, in a few days afterwards. Mr. Osborne formally offered to
take the boy, and make him heir to the fortune which he had intended that
his father should inherit. he would make Mrs. George Osborne an
allowance, such as to assure her a decent competency. If Mrs., George
Osborne proposed to marry again, as Mr. O, heard was her intention, he
would not withdraw that allowance. But it must be understood, that
the child would live entirely with his grandfather in russell Square, or at
whatever other place Mr. O. should select; and that he would be occasion-
ally permitted to see Mrs. George Osborne at her own residence. This
message was brought or read to her in a letter one day, when her mother
was from home, and her father absent as usual, in the City,
She was never seen angry but twice or thrice in her life, and it was in
one of these foods that Mr, Osborne's attorney had the fortune to
behold her. She rose up trembling and flushing very much as soon as, after
reading the letter, Mr. Poe handel it to her, and she tore the paper into
a hundred fragments, which she trod on. ``I marry ngnin l-I take money
to part from my child1 Who dares insult me by proposing such a thing:
Tell Mr. Osborne it is a cowardly letter, Sir-a cowardly letter-I will not

answer it. I wish you good morning, Sir-and she bowed me out of the
room like a tragedy Green,'' said the lawyer who told the story.
Her parents never remarked her agitation on that day, and she never
told them of the interview. They had their own affairs to interest them,
affairs which deeply interested this innocent and unconscious lady. The
old gentleman, her father, was always dabbling in speculation. We have
seen how the Wine Company and the Coal Company had failed him. But,
prowling about the City always eagerly and restlessly still, he lighted upon
some other scheme, of which he thought so well that he embarked in it in
spite of the remonstrants of Mr, Clapp, to whom indeed he never dared
to tell how far he had engaged himself in it. And as it was always
Mr. Sedley's maxim not to talk about money matters before women, they
had no inkling of the misfortunes that are in store for them until the
unhappy old gentleman was forced to make gradual confessions.
The bills of the little household, which had been settle weekly, first fell
into arrears. The remittances had not arrived from India, Mr. Sedley told
his wife with a disturbed face. As she had paid her bills very regularly
hitherto, one or two of the tradesmen to whom the poor lady was obliged
to go round asking for time were very angry at a delay, to which they
were perfectly used from more irregular customers. Emmy's contribution,
paid over cheerfully without any questions, kept the little company in half
rations however. And the first six months passed away pretty easily : old
Sedley still keeping up with the notion that his shares must rise, and
that all would be well.
No sixty pounds, however, came to help the household at the end of
the half year; and it fell deeper and deeper into trouble-Mrs. Sedley,
who was growing infirm and was much shaken, remained silent or wept a
great deal with Mrs. Clapp in the kitchen. The butcher was particularly
surly: the grocer insolent-once or twice little Georgy had grumbled
about the dinners: and Amelia, who still would have been satisfied with a
slice of bread for her own dinner, could not but perceive that her son was
neglected, and purchased little things one of her private purse to keep the
boy in health.
At last they told her, or told ler such a garbledl story as people in it6-
culture tell. One day, her own money having been received, and Amelia
about to pay it over: the who had kept an account of the money expended
by her, proposed to keep a certain portion back out of her dividend,
having contracted engagements for a new suit for Georgy.
when it came out that Jos's remittances were not paid; that the house
was in difficulties which Amelia ought to have seen before, her mother said,
but she cared for nothing or nobody except Georgy. At this she passed all
of her money across the table without a word to her mother, and returned
to her room to cry her eyes out. She had a great access of sensibility too
that by, when obliged to go and countryman the clothes, the darling
clothes on which she had sent her heart for Christmas day, and the cut and
fashion of which she had arranged in many conversations with a small
milliner, her friend.
Hardest of all, she had to break the matter to Georgy, who made a long
outer. Every body had new clothes at Christmas. The others would

him. the poor widow lad only kisses to give him. She darnell the all
suit in tears. She cost about among her little ornaments to see could she
sell any thing to procure the desired noveltiesP here was her India
shawl that bobbin had sent her. She remembered in former daye going
with her mother to a five India shop on Ludgate Ilill, where the ladies
had all sorts of dealings and bargains in those articles. 1Her checks
flushed and her eyes shone with pleasure ns she thought of this resource,
and the kissed away george to school in the morning, smiling brightly
after him. The boy felt there was good news in her look.
Picking up her shawl in a handkerchief, (another of the gifts of the good
MAjor,) she hid them under her cloak, and walked flushed and eager all
the way to Ludgate IIill, tripping along by the Park wall, and running
over the crossings, so that many a man turned ns she hurried by him, and
looked after her rosy pretty face. She caleultcd how she should spend
the proceeds of her shawl: how, besides tho clothes, she would buy the
books that he longed for, and pay his hall-year's schooling;: and how slc
would buy a clock for her father instead of that old great-coat which he
wore. She was not mistaken as to the value of the Major's gift. It was
a very fine and beautiful web: and the merchant made a Very good bar-
gain when he gave her twenty guineas for her shawl.
She in on amazed and flurries with her riches to Dayton's shop in St.
Paul's Church lard, and there purchased the ` parent's Assistant,'' and.
the ``Snmndforl and Merton'' Georgy longed for, and got into the coach
there with her parcel, nd went home exsulting. And she pleased herself
by writing in the fly-leaf in hcr centers little hand, ``George Osborne, S
Christmas gift from his affectionate mother.'' The books are extant to this
day, with the fair delicate superscription.
She was going from her own room with the books in her nhl to
place them on George's table, where he might find them on his return
from school,; when in the passage, she and er nolher met. The gilt
bindings of the seven handsome little volumes caught the old lady's eye.
 WHat are those P'' she said.
 Some books for Georgy,'' Amelia replied, blusling-'` I-I promised
tcm to him at Christmas.''

it echoed through every room in the small house, whereof the other female
inmates heard every word of the colloquy.

morning. TAke the money-take everything ''-and with quivering hands
she took out her liver, and her sovereigns-her precious golden sovereigns,
which she thrust into the buds of her mother, whence they overflowed and
tumbled, rolling down the stairs.
And then she went into her room, and sank down in despair and utter
misery. She saw it all now. Her selfishness was sacrificing the boy. But
for her he might have wealth, station, education, and his father's place,
which the elder George had forfeited for her sake. She had but to
speak the words, and her father was restored to competency : and the boy
raised to fortune. O what a conviction it was to that tender and stricken

street leads, whither we first conducted Rebecca,
in the time of the departed Sir Pitt Crawley.
Peering over the railings and through the black
trees into the garden of the Square, you see a fe
miserable governesses with wan-faced pupils wan-
during round and round it, and round the dreary
grass-plot in the centre of which rises the star
of Lord Gaunt, who fought at Minden, in a three-
tailed wig, and otherwise habits like a Roman
eMperor. Gaunt Ilouse occupies nearly a side of
the quire. he remaining three sides are com-
posed of mansions that have passed away into
Dowager;-tall, dark houses, with window-
frames of stone, or picked out of a lighter red.
Little light seems to be behind those lean, cou-
fortress casement now: and hospitality to have
passed away from those doors as much as th
laced lacqueys and link-boys of old times, who used
to put out their torches in the blank iron extinguislers that still flank the
lamps over the steps. Brass plates have penetrated into the Square-
Doctors, the bDidllesex bank WEstern Branch-the English and European
Reunion, &e.-it has a dreary look-nor is my Lord Steyne's palace less
dreary. All I have ever seen of it is the vast wall in front, with the rustic
columns at the great gate, through which an old porter peers sometimes with
a fat and gloomy red face-and over the wall the garret and bed-room
windows, and the chimneys, out of which there seldom comes any smoke
now. For the present LOrd Steyne lives at Naples, preferring the view of
the Bay and Cnpri nnl Vesuius, to the dreary aspect of the wall in

A few score of yards down New Gaunt-street, and leading into Gaunt-

the famous petits apartments of Lord Steyne-one, Sir, fitted up all in
ivory and white satin, another in ebony and black velvet; there is a little
banqucting-room taken from Sallust's house at Pompeii, and painted by
Conway-a little private kitchen, in which every saucepan was silver, and
all the spits were gold. It was there that Elite Orleans posted par-
bridges on the night when he and the Marquis of Steyne won a hundred
thousand from a great personage at Sombre. Half of the money went to
the French Revolution, half to purchaseLord Gaunt's Marquise and Garter
-and the remainder-'' but it forms no part of our scheme to tell what
became of the remainder, for every shilling of which, and a great deal more,
little Tom Eaves, who knows everybody's affairs, is ready to account.
Besides his town palace, the Marquis had castles and palaces in various
quarters of the three kingdoms, whereof the descriptions may be found in
the old-books-Castle Strongbow, with its woods, on the Shannon
shore; Gaunt Castle, in Crmrthenshire, where Richard II. was taken
prisoner-Greatly Hall in Yorkshire, where I have been informed there
were two hundred silver teapots for the breakfasts of the guests of the
house, with everything to correspond in splendour; and Stillbrook in
HAmpshire, which was my lord's farm, a humble place of residence, of
which we all remember the wonderful furniture which was sold at my lord's
demise by a late celebrated auctioneer,
The Marchioness of Steyne was of the renowned and ancient family
of the Caerlyons, Marquises of Camelot, who have preserved the old faith
ever since the conversion of the venerable Druid, their first ancestor, and
whose pedigree goes far beyond the date of the arrival of King Brute in
these islands, Pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house. The
sons have been called Arthurs, Others, and Parades, from immemorial
time. Their heads have fallen in many a loyal conspiracy. Elizabeth
chopped of the head of the Arthur of her day, who had been Chamberlain
to philip and Mary, and carried letters between the Queen of Scots and
her uncles the Guises. A cadet of the house was an officer of the great
Duke, and distinguished in the famous Saint Bartholomew conspiracy.
During the whole of Mary's confinement, the house of Camelot conspired
in her behalf. It was as much injured by its charges in fitting out an
armament against the Spaniards, during the time of the Armada, as by the
fines and confiscations levied on it by Elizabeth for harbouring of priests,
obstinate recusancy, and Popish misdoings. A recrennt of James's time
was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of that
great theologian, and the fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his
timely weakness. But the Earl of Camelot, of the reign of Charles,
returned to the old creel of his family, and they continued to fight for it,
and ruin themselves for it, as long as there was a Start left to head or to
instigate a rebellion.
Lady Mary Caerlyon was brought up at a Prison convent, the Dan-
phiness Marie Antoinette was her godmother. In the pride of her beauty
she had been married-sold, it was said-to Lord Gaunt, then at Paris,
who won just sums from the lady's brother at some of Philip of Orleans's
banquets. The Earl of Gaunt's famous duel with the Count de ls Marche,

of the Grey Musqueteers, was attributed by common report to the return-
sions of that ollicer (who had been a pge, and remained a favourite of
the queen) to the hand of the beautiful Lady Mary Cuerlyon. She was
married to Lord Gaunt while the Count lay all of his wounds, and came to
dwell at Gaunt House, and to figure for a short time in the splendid Court
of the Prince of Wales. Fox nhl toasted her. Morris and Sheridan and
written songs about her. MIalmsbry had made her his best bow; Wal-
pole had pronounced her charming; Devonslire had been almost jealous
of her; but she was scared by the wild pleasures and varieties of the society
into which she was flung, and after she had borne a couple of sons, shrank
away into a life of devout seclusion. No wonder that my Lord Style,
who liked pleasure and cheerfulness, was not often seen after their marriage,
by the side of his trembling, silent, superstitious, unhappy lady.
The before-mentioned Tom Eaves, (who has no part in this history,
except that he knew all the great folks in London, and the stories and
mysteries of each family,) had further information regarding my ludy
Sleyne, which may or may not be true.  The humiliations,'' TOm used to
say, `which that woman has been made to undergo, in her own house,
have been frightful; Lord Steyne has made her sit down to table with
women with whom I would rather die than allow Mrs. Eaves to associate-
with Lady Crackenbury, with Mrs. Chippenhm, with Madame de la
Cruchecasse, the French secretary's wife,'' (from every one of which ladies
Tom IEnves-who would have sacrificed his wife for knowing them-was
too glad to get a bow or a dinner), ``with the reigning favourite, in a word.
And do you suppose that hat woman, of that family, who are as proud as
the Bourbons, and to whom the Steynes are but lackeys, mushrooms of
yesterday (for after all, they are out of the old Gaunt, but of a minor and
doubtful branch of the house); do you suppose, l sny,'' (the render must bear
in min that it is always Tom Eaves who speaks), ``that the Mnrchioness of
tyne, the haughtiest woman in England, would bend down to her husband
so submissive, if there were not some cause Pool I tell you there are
secret reasons. I tell you, that in the emigration, the Abbe de la MArch
who was here and was employed in the uiberoon business with Puieaya
and Tinteniac, was the same Colonel of Mousquetaires Gris with whom
Steyne fought in the year '86-that he and the Marchioness met again:
that it was after the Reverend Colonel was shot in Brittany, that Lady
Steyne took to those extreme practices of devotion which she carries on
now : for she is closeted with her director every day-she is at service at
Spanish-place, every morning, I'e watched her there-that is, i've
happened to be passing thero-and depend on it there's a mystery in her
case. People are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent
of,'' added Tom Eaves with a knowing wag of his head; ``and depend
on it, that woman would not be so submissive as she is, if the Marquis
had not some sword to hold over her,''
8o, if Mr. Ears's information be correct, it is very likely that this lady
in her high station, had to submit to many a private indiguity, and to hide
many secret griefs under a calm face. And let us, my brethren, who have
not our names in the Red Book, console ourselves by thinking comfortably

how miserable our betters may be, and that Damocles, who sits on satin
cushions, and is served on old plate, has an awful sword hanging over his
head in the shape of a bailiff, or an hereditary disease, or a family secret,
which peeps out every now and then from the embroidered arrays in a
ghastly manner, and will be sure to drop one day or the other in the
right place.
In comparing, to, the poor man's situation with that of the great, tlerc
is (always according to Mr. Eaves) another great source of comfort for
the former. o who have little or no patrimony to bequeath or to
inherit, may be on good terms with your father or your son, whereas the
leir of a great prince, such as my Lord Steyue, must naturally be angry
at being kept out of his kingdom, and eye the occupant of it with no very
agreeable glances. 'Take it as a rule,'' this sardonic old SLaves would
say, `" the fathers and elder sons of all great families hate each other. The
Crown Prince is always in opposition to the crown or answering after it.
Shukspeare knew the world, my good Sir, and when he deserilies Prince
HIll (from whose family the Gaunt pretend to be descended, though they
are no more related to John of Gaunt than you are,) trying on his father's
coronet, he gives you a natural description of all heirs-apparent. If you
were heir to a dukedom and a thousand pounds a day, do you mean to
say you would not wish for possession? Pool And it stands to reason
that every great man, having experienced this feeling towards his father,
must be aware that his son entertains it towards himself; and so they
can't but be suspicious and hostile.
 Then again, as to the feeling of elder towards younger sous. MIy
lens Sir, you ought to know that every elder brother looks upon the cadets
of the house as his natural enemies who deprive him of so much ready
money which ought to be his by right. I have often heard George
Mae Turk, Lord lajazet's eldest son, say that if he had his will, when he
came to the title, he would do what the sultans do, and clear the estate
by chopping off all his younger brothers' heads at once ; and so the case
is, more or less, with them all. I tell you they are all turks in their
hearts. Pool Sir, they know the world.'' And here, haply, a great
nan coming up, To Elves's hat would drop off his head, and he would
rush forward with a bow and a grin, which showed that he knew the
world to-in the Tomeuvesiun way, that is. And having laid out every
shilling of his fortune on an annuity, Tom could afford to bear no malice
to his nephews and nieces, and to have no other feeling with regard to his
betters, but a constant and generous desire to one with them.
Between the Marchioness and the natural and tender regard of mother
for children, there was that cruel barrier placed of difference of faith. The
very love which she might feel for her sons, only served to render the
timid and pious lady nore fearful and unhappy. The guelph which sepa-
rated them was fatal aud impassable, She could not stretch her weak
arms across it, or draw her children over to that side away from which
her belief told her there was no safety. During the youth of his sons,

vowed he would use all his influence to get Trail a cardinal's that if he
would secede. Neither divine allowed himself to be conquered; and
though the foul mother hoped that her youngest and favourite son would
be reconciled to her church-his mother church-a sad and awful disap-
ointment awaited the devout lady-a disappointment which seemed to
be a judgment upon her for the sin of her marriage.
My Lord Gaunt married, as every person who frequents the Peerage
knows, the Lady Blanche Thistlewood, a daughter of the noble house of
Reserves, before mentioned in this voracious history. A wing of Gaunt
House was assigned to this couple; for the head of the family chose
to govern it, and while he reigned to reign supreme : his son and heir,
however, living little at home, disagreeing with his wife, borrowing open
post-bits such monies as he required beyond the very moderate sums

which his father was disposed to allow him. The marquis knew every
shilling of his son's debts. At his lamented demise, he was found himself
to be possessor of many of his hair's bonds, purchased for their benefit,
and devised by his lordship to the children of his younger son.
As, to my Lord Gaunt's dismay, and the chuckling delight of his natural
enemy and further, the Lady Gaunt had no children-the Lord George
Gaunt was desired to return from Vienna, where he was engaged in waltzing
and diplomacy, and to contract a matrimonial alliance with the Honourable
Joan, only daughter of John Jones, First Baron Helvellyn, and head of
the firm of Jones, Brown, and Robinson, of Threadneedle Street, Bankers;
from which union sprang several sons and daughters, whose doings do
not appearing to this story.
The marriage at first was a happy and prosperous one. My Lord George
Gaunt could not only read, but write pretty correctly. He spoke French
with considerable fluency; and was one of the finest walters in europe.
With these talents, and his interest at home, there was little doubt that his
lordship would rise to the highest dignities in his profession. The lady,
his wife, felt that courts were her sphere; and her wealth enabled her to
receive splcndidly in those continental tows whither her husband's diplo-
marie duties led him. There was talk of appointing him minister, and bets
were laid at the Travellers' that he would be ambassador ere long, when
of a sudden, rumours arrived of the secretary's extraordinary behaviour.
At a grand diplomatic dinner given by his chief, he had started up, and
declared that a dtc defoe gras was poisoned. He went to a ball at the
hotel of the Bavarian envoy, the Count de Springbok-Hohenlnufen, with
his head shaved, and dressed as a Capuchin friar. It was not a asked
ball, as some folks wanted to persuade you. It was something queer,
people whispered. IIis grandfather was so. It was in the family.
His wife and family returned to this country, and took up their abode
at Gaunt Ilouse. Lord George gave up his post on the European con-
patient, and was gazetted to brazil. But people knew better; he never
returned from that Brazil expedition-never died there-neer lived there
-=-never was there at all. IIe was nowhere: he was gone out altogether.
Brazil,'' said one gossip to another, with n grin-'`Brazil is St. John's
Wood. Rio Janeiro is a cottage surrounded by four walls; and George
Gaunt is accredited to n keeper, who has invested him with the order of
the Straight Wnistcoat.'' These are two kinds of epitaphs which men
pass over one another in Vanity Fair,
Twice or thrice in a week, in the earliest morning, the poor mother went
for her sins and saw the poor invalid. Sometimes he laughed at her, (and his
daughter was more pitiful than to hear him cry); sometimes she found the
brilliant dandy diplomatic of the Congress of Vienna dragging about a
child's toy, or nursing the keeper's baby's doll. Sometimes he knew her
and Father Mole, her director and companion : oftener he forgot her, as
he had done wife, children, love, ambition, vanity. But he remembered
his dinner-hour, and used to cry if his wine-and-water was not strong
enough.
It was the mysterious taint of the blood : the poor mother had brought
it from her own ancient race. The evil had broken out once or twice in

and tears and openness had been offered in their expiration. The pride
of the race was struck down as the firstborn of Pharaoh. The dark mark
of fate and doom was on the threshold,-the tall old threshold surmounted
by cornets and carved heraldry.

father, and devised plans against his return. Then the name of the
living dead man was less frequently in their mouths-then not mentioned
at all. But the stricken old grandmother trembled to think that these
too were the interiors of their father's same as well as of his honours:
and watched sickening for the day when the awful ancestral curse should
come down on them.
This dark presentiment also haunted Lord Steyne. He tried to lay the
horrid bed-side ghost in Rel Seas of wine and jointly, and lost sight of it

sometimes in the crowd and out of his pleasures. But it always came
back to him when alone, and seemed to grow more threatening with years.
I have taken your son,'' it said, '` why not you I may slut you up in
a prison some dlsy like your son George. I may tap you on the head to-
morrow, and away go pleasure and honours, feasts and beauty, friends,
flattered, French cooks, fine horses and houses-in exchange for a prison,
n keeper, and a straw mattress like George Gaunt's.'' And then my lord
would defy the ghost which threatened him : for he knew of a remedy by
which he could baulk his enemy.
So there was splendour and wealth, but no great happiness percbance
behind the tall carved portals of Gaunt House with its smoky cornets
and ciphers. The feasts there were of the grandest in London, but there
was not over-much content therewith, except among the guests who sate
aut my lord's table. IPad he not been so great a Prince very few possibly
wouLd have visited him: but in Vanity Fair the sin of very great
personages arce looked at indulgent. ``Nous reardon a de fois'' (as the
French lady said) before we condemn a person of my lord's unloubted
quality. ome notorious careers and squeamish moralists might be sulky
with Lord Steyne, but they were glad enough to come when he asked
them.
'Lord Steyne is really too bad,'' Lady Slingstone said, '`but everybody
goes, and of course I shall see that my girls come to no harm.'' : His
lordship is a man to whom I owe much, everything in life,'' said the
Right Reverend Doctor Trail, thinking that the Archbishop was rather
shaky ; and MIrs. Trail and the young ladies would as soon have missed
going to church as to one of his lordship's parties. ` His morals are
bad,'' said little Lord Touchdown to his sister, who meekly exspostulated,
having heard terrific legends from her mamma with respect to the doings
at Gaunt House; `' but hang it, he 's got the best dry Silvery in Europe 1''
And as for Sir itt Crawley, Bart,-Sir Pitt that pattern of decorum, Sir
Pitt who had led off at missionary meetings,-he need for one moment
thought of not going too.  Where you see such persons as the Bishop of
Ealing nd the Countess of Clingstone, you may be pretty sure, Jane,''
the Baronet would say, '` that we cannot he wrong. The great rank and
station of Lord Steyne put him in a position to command people in our
station in life. The Lord Lieutenant of a County, my dear, is respectable
man. Besides George Gaunt and I were intimate in carly life: he was
my junior when we were attaches at Pumpernickel together,''
In a word everybody went to wait upon this great man-everybody
who was asked: as you the reader (do not say nay) or I the writer thereof
would go if we had an invitation.

Last Becky's kindness and attention to
the chief of her husband's family, were
destined to meet with an exceeding
great reward; a reward which, though
certainly somewhat unsubstantial, the
little woman coveted with greater
eagerness than more positive benefits.
If she did not wish to lend n virtuous
life, at least she desired to enjoy a
character for virtue, and we know
that no lady in the genteel world
can possess this desileratum, punished
has put on a train and feathers, and
has been presented to her Sovereign
at Court. From that august inter-
view they come out stamped ns honest
women. The Lord Chamberlain gives
them a certificate of virtue. And as
dubious goods or letters are passed
through an oven at quarantine, spring-
led with aromatic vinegar, and then
pronounced clean-many a lady
whose reputation would be doubtful
otherwise and liable to give infection,
passes through the wholesome ordeal
of the Royal presence, and issues from it free from all taint.
It might be very well for my Lady Breweries, my Lady Tufto, Mrs. Bute
Crawley in the country, and other ladies who had come into contact with
MIrs. Rawdon Crawley, to try fire at the idea of the odious little adventuress
making her curtsey before the Sovereign, and to declare, that if dear good
queen Charlotte had been alive, ale neer would have admitted such an
extremely ill-regulated personasge into Her chaste drawing-room. But
when we consider, that it was the FirstGentleman in Europe in whose high
presence Mrs. Rawdon passed her examination, and as it were, took her
degree in reputation, it surely must be flat disloyalty to doubt any more
about her virtue. I, for my part, look back with love and are to that
Great Character in history. Ah, what a high and noble appreciation of
Gentlemanhood there must have been in Vanity Fair, when that revered
and august being was invested, by the universal acclaim of the refined and
educated portion of this empire, with the title of Premier Gentilhomme of

hal leave from their loyal masters to go out from Slaughter ouse School
where they were educated, and to appear on Drury Lane stage, amongst a
crowd which assembled there to greet the king. TIME ING: There he

seles almost to be, ready to die for him. as, we saw him. Fate cannot
ever us of that. Others have seen Napoleon. Some few still exist who
have beheld Frederick thc Great, Doctor Johnson, MArie Antoinette, c.
-be it our reasonable boast to our children, that we saw George the Good,
the Magnificent, the Great.
Well, there can a happy day in MIrs. Rawdon Crawley's existence when
this angel was admitted into the paradise of a Court which she coveted:
her sister-in-law acting as her god-other. On the appointed day, Sir Pitt
and his lady in their great family carriage (just newly built, and ready for
the bayonets assumption of the office of High Sheriff of his county) drove
up to the little house in Curzon Street, to the edification of Raggles who
was watching from his green-grocer's shop, and s fine plumes within, and
enormous bunches of flowers in the breasts of the new livery-coats of the
footmen.
Sir Pitt, in a glittering uniform, descended and went into Curzon Street,
lis sword between his legs. Little Rawdon stool with his face against
the parlour window panes, smiling and nodding with all his might to his
aunt in the carriage within; and presently Sir Pitt issued forth from the
house again, leading forth a lady with grand feathers, covered in a white
shawl, and holding up daintily a train of magnificent brocade. She stepped
into the vehicle as if she were a princess and accustomed all her life to go
to Court, smiling graciously on the footman at the door, and on Sir Pitt,
who followed hcr into the carriage.
Then awdon followed in his old Guards' uniform, which had grown
woefully shabby, and was much too tight. He was to have followed the
procession, and waited upon his sovereign in a cab; but that his good-
natured sister-in-law insisted that they should be a family party. The
coach was large, the ladies not very big, they would hold their trains in
their laps-finally, the four went fraternal together; and their carriage
presently joined the line of loyal equipages which is making its way
down piccadilly and St. James's Street, towards the old brick palace, where
the Star of Brunswick was in waiting to receive his nobles and gentlefolks.
Becky felt as if she could bless the people out of the carriage windows,
o elated was she in spirit, and so strong a sense hud she of the dignified

42I
position which she had at last attained in life. Een our Becky had her
weaknesses, and as one often sees how men pride themselves upon excel-
species which others are slow to perceive: how, for instance, Comus firmly
believes that he is the greatest tragic actor in England; how Brown, the
famous novelist, longs to be considered, not a man of genius, but a man
of fashion; while Robinson, the great lawyer, does not in the least care
about his reputation in Westminster all, but believes himself income-
parable across country, and at a five-barred gate-to, to be, and to be
thought, a respectable woman was Becky's aim in life, and she got up the
genteel with amazing assiduity, readiness, and success. We have said,
there were times when she believed herself to be a fine lady, and forgot
that there was no money in the chest at lome-duns round the gate,
tradesmen to coax and wheel-no ground to walk upon, in a word.
And as she went to court in the carriage, the family carriage, she adopted
a demeanour so grand, self-satisfied, deliberate, and imposing, that it made
even Lady Jane laugh. She walked into the royal apartments with a loss
of the head which would have befitted an empress, and I have no doubt
had she been one, she would have become the character perfectly.
We are authorised to state that Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's coste de corn
on the occasion of her presentation to the Sovereign was of the most
elegant and brilliant description. Some ladies we may have seen, we,
who wear stars and cordons, and attend the St. James's assemblies, or we,
who, in muddy boots, dawdle up and down Tall Mall, and deep into the
coaches as they drive up with the great folks in their feathers-some
ladies of fashion, I say, we may have seen, about two o'clock of the fore-
noon of a levee day, as the laced-jacketed end of the Life Guards are
blowing triumphal marches seated on those praneing music-stools, their
cream-coloured chargers-who are by no means lonely and enticing objects
at that early period of noon. A stout countess of sixty, decolletee, pointed,
wrinkled, with rouge up to her drooping eyelids, and diamonds twinkling
in her wig, is n wholesome and edifying, but not a pleasant sight. She
has the faded look of a St. James's Street illumination, as it may be seen
of an early morning, when half the lamps are out, and the others are
blinking wally, as if they were about to vanish like ghosts before the
dawn. Such charms, as those of which we catch glimpses while her
ladyship's carriage passed, should appear abroad at night alone. If even
Cynthia looks haggard of an afternoon as we may asce her sometimes in the
present winter season, with Plebus staring her out of countenance from
the opposite side of the heavens, how much more can old Indy Castle-
mouldy keep her head up when the sun is shining full upon it through the
chariot windows, and showing all the chinks and crannies with which
time has marked her face No. Drawing-rooms should be announced
for November, or the first foggy day: or the elderly sultans of our
Vanity Fair should drive up in closed litters, descend in a covered way,
and make their curtsey to the Sovereign under the protection of limelight.
Our beloved Rebecca had no need, however, of any such n friendly
hull to set off her beauty. Her complexion could bear any sunshine ns
yet; and her dress, though if you were to see it now, any present lady of
Vanity Fair would pronounce it to be the most foolish and preposterous

VANITY AIB.
attire eer worn, was as handsome in her eyes and those of the public,
some five-and-twenty years since, as the most brilliant costume of the most
famous beauty of the present season. A score of years hence that, too,
that milliner's wonder, will have passed into the domain of the absurd,
along with all previous vanities. But we are wandering too much. Mrs.
Rawdon's dress was pronounced to be chairman on the ecentful day of her
presentation. Even got little Lady Jane was forced to acknowledge
this effect, as she looked at her kinswoman; and owned sorrowfully to
herself that she was quite inferior in taste to Mrs. Becky.
She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Rawdon
had bestowed upon that garment. Rebecca had as good taste ns any
millincr in Europe, and such a clever way of doing things as Lady Jane
little understood. The latter quickly spied out the magnificence of the
brocade of Becky's train, and the splendour of the race on her dress.
The bracelet was an old remnant, Becky said; and as for the place, it
was a great bargain. She had had it these hundred years.
My car Mrs. Crawley, it must have cost a little fortune,'' Lady Jane
sail, looking down at her own lace, which was not nearly so good; and
then remaining the quality of the ancient brocade, which formed the
material of Mrs. Rawdon's court dress, she felt inclined to say that she
could not afford such fine clothing, but checked that speech, with an effort,
as one uncharitable to her kinswoman.
And yet if Lady Jane hal known all, i think even her kindly temper
would have failed her. The fact is, when she was putting Sir Pitt's house
in order, Mrs. Rawdon had found the face and the brocade in old ward-
robes, the property of the former ladies of the house, and had quietly
carried the goods home, and had suited them to her own little person.
Briggs saw her take them, asked no questions, told no stories; but I
believe quite sympathised with her on this matter, and so would many
another honest woman.
And the diamonds- Where the doose did you get the diamonds,
Becky'' said her husband, admiring some jewels which he had never seen
before, and which sparkled in her ears and on her neck with brilliance
and profusion.
Becky brushed a little, and looked at him harl for a moment. Pitt
Crawley brushed a little too, and looked out of window. The fact is, he
had given her a very small portion of the brilliant; a pretty diamond
clasp, which confined a pearl necklace which she wore; and the lBaronet
had omitted to mention the circumstance to his lady.
Becky looked at her husband, and then at Sir Pitt, with an air of saucy
triumph-as much as to say, ``Shall I betray you''
``Guess.'' she said to her husband.  Why, you silly man,'' the
continued, '` where do you suppose I got them-all except the little clasp,
which a dear friend of mine give me long age. I hired them, to be sure.
I hired them at Mr. Polonius's, in Coventry-street. You don't suppose
that all the diamonds which go to court belong to the owners; like those
beautiful stones which Lady Jane has, and which are much handsome
than any which I have, I am certain.''
They are family jewels,'' said Sir Pitt, again looking uneasy. And

in this family conversation the carriage rolled down the street, until its
cargo was finally discharged at the gates of the palace where the Sovereign
was sitting in state.
The diamonds, which had created Rawdon's admiration, never went back
to Mr. Polonius, of Coventry-street, and that gentleman never applied for
their restoration ; but they retired into a little private repository, in an
old desk, which Amelia Sedley had given her years and years ago, and in
which Becky kept a number of useful and, perhaps, valuable things, about
which her husband knew nothing. To know nothing, or little, is in the
nature of some husbands. To hide, in the nature of how many women 
O ladies how many of you have surreptitious milliners' bills? How
any of you have gowns and bracelets, which you buren't show, or which
you wear trembling -trembling, and coaxing with smiles the husband by
your side, who does not know the new velvet down from the old one, of
the new bracelet from last year's,or has any notion that the ragged-
looking yellow lace surf cost forty guineas, and that Madame Bombing is
writing during letters every week for the money l
Thus Ruwdon knew nothing about the brilliant diamond ear-rings, or the
superb brilliant ornament which decorated the fair bosom of his lady;
bt Lord Steyne, who was in his place at court, as Lord of the Powder
Closet, and one of the great dignitaries and illustrious defences of the
throne of England, and came up with all his stars, garters, collars, anl
cordons, and paid particular attention to the little woman, knew whence the
jewels came, and who paid for them.
As he bowed over her he smiled, and quoted the hnckneyel and beautiful
lines, from the Rate of the Lock, about Belinda's diamonds, ``which Jews
might kiss and infidels alone.''
 But I hope your lordship is orthodox,'' said the little lady, with a
loss of her head. And many ladies round about whispered and talked,
and many gentlemen noted and whispered, as they saw what marked
attention the great nobleman was paying to the little adventuress.
What were the circumstances of the interview between Rebecca Crawley,
ne Sharp, and her Imperial MAster, it does not become such a feeble and
inexperienced pen as mine to attempt to relate. The dazzlcd eyes close
before that Magnificent Ides. Loyal respect and decency tell even the
imagination not to look too keenly and audaciously about the sacred
audience-chamber, but to back away rapidly, silently, and respectfully,
making profound bows out of the August Presence.
This may be said, that in all London there was no more loyal heart than
Becky's after this interview. The name of her king was always on her
lips, and he was proclaimed by her to be the most charming of men. She
went to Mcdonagh's and ordered the finest portrait of him that art had
produced, and credit would supply. She chose that famous one in which
the best of monarchs is represented in a frock-coat with a fur collar, and
breaches and silk stockings, simmering on a sofa from under lis curly
brown wig. She had him painted in a brooch and wore it-indeed she
amused and somewhat pesterel er acquaintance with her perpetual talk
about his urbnnity and beauty. Who knows Perhaps the little woman
thought she might play the part of a Maintenon or a Pompadour.

UNIFY AIR.
But the finest sport of all after her presentation was to hear her talk
vigorously. She had a few female aequaiutanees, not, it must be owned,
of the very highest reputation in Vanity Fair. But being made an honest
woman of, so to speak, Becky would not consort any longer with these
dubious ones, and cut Lady Crackenbury, when the latter nodded to her
from her opera-box; and gave Mrs. Washington White the go-by in the
Ring. '`One must, my dear, show one is somebody ;'' she said.  One
must't be seen with doubtful people. I pity Lady Crackenbury from my
heart; and Mrs. Washington White may be a very good-natured person.
It may go and dine with them, as you like your rubber. But I mustn't,
and won't; and you will have the goodness to tell Smith to say I am not
at home when either of the calls,''
The particulars of Becky's costume were in the newspapers-feathers,
appears, superb diamonds, and all the rest. Mrs. Crackenbury read the
paragraph in bitterness of spirit, and discourse to her followers about the
air which that woman was giving herself. Mrs. Bute Crawley and her
young ladies in the country had a copy of the Morning Post from town;
and gave a vent to their honest indignation.  If you had been sandy-
haired, green-eyed, and a French rope-dancer's daughter,'' MIrs. Bute said
to her eldest girl (who, on the contrary, was a very swarthy, short, and
snub-nosed young lady), `` you might have had superb diamonds forsyth,
and have been presented at court, by your cousin, the Lady Jane. But
you 're only a gentleman, my poor dear child. you have only some of
the best blood in england in your veins, and good principles and piety for
your portion. I, myself, the wife of a Baronet's younger brother, too,
never thought of such a thing as going to court-nor woud other people,
if good (queen Charlotte had been alive.'' In this way the worthy Directors
consoled herself; and her daughters sighed, and sate over the Peerage all
night.
A few days after the famous presentation, another great and exceeding
honour was vouchsafed to the virtuous Becky, Lady there's carriage
love up to Mr. Rawdon Crowley's door, and the footman, instead of
driving down the front of the house, as by his tremendous knocking he
appeared to be inclined to do, relented, and only delivered in a couple of
cards, on which were engraved the names of the Marchioness of Steyne
and the Countess of Gaunt. If these bits of skateboard had been beau-
tiful pictures, or and had a hundred yards of Marines lace rolled round
them, worth twice the number of guineas, Becky could not have regarded
them with more pleasure. You may be sure they occupied a conspicuous
place in the china bowl on the drawing-room table, where Becky
kept the cards of her visitors. Lord lord how poor Mrs. Washington
White's card and Lady Crackenbury's card, which our little friend had
been glad enough to get a few months back, and of which the silly little
creature was rather proud once-Lord lord I say, how soon at the
appearance of these grand court cards, did those poor little neglected

and Briggs looked out those august names in the Peerage, and followed
the noble races up through all the ramifications of the family tree.
My Lord Steyne coming to call a couple of hours afterwards, and looking
about him, and observing everything as was his wont, found his lady's cards
already ranged as the trumps of bEcky's hand, and grinned, as this old cynic
always did at any naive display of human weakness. Becky came down
to him presently: whenever the dear girl expected his lordship, her
toilette was prepared, her hair in perfect order, her mouchoirs, aprons,
scarfs, little morocco flippers, and other female gimcracks arranged, and
she seated in some artless and agreeable posture ready to receive him-
whenever she was surprised, of course, she had to fly to her apartment to
take a rapid survey of matters in the glass, and to trip down again to
wait upon the great peer.
She found him grinning over the bowl. She was discovered, and she
brushed a little.  Thank you, Monseigneur,'' she said.  You see your
ladies have been here. How good of you? I couldn't come before-I
was in the kitchen making a pulling.''
 I know you were, I saw you through the area-railings as I drove up,''
replied the old gentleman.
You see everything,'' she replied.
A few things, but not the, my pretty lady,'' he said good-naturally.

no doubt you were putting a little rough on; you must give some of

Mra. Rawdon plaintive, and she rubbed her cheek with her handkerchief
as if to show there was no rouge at all, only genuine bushes and modesty
in her case. About this who can toll I know there is some rouge
that won't come off on a pocket-handkerchief ; and some so good that
even tears will not disturb it.

aur fees, look out and hold your own How the women will bully you'l''
This was a very long speech for a man of few words like my Lord Steyne;
nor was it the first which he had uttered for Becky's benefit on that day.
Briggs looked up from the work-table at which she was seated in the
further room, and gave a deep sigh as she heard the great Marquis speak
so lightly of her sex.
If' you don't turn off the abominable-sheep dog,'' said Lord
Stcyne, with a savage look oer lis shoulder at her, `I will hose her
poisoned,''
I always give my dog dinner from my own plate,'' said Reece,
laughing mischievous; and having enjoyed for some time the dioscori-
ture of a lord, who hated poor riggs for interrupting his tete-i-tate
with the fair Colonel's wife, Mrs. Rawdon at length had pity upon he
admirer, and calling to briggs, praised the fitness of the weather to her,
and made her to take out the child for a walk.
``I can't send her away,'' Becky said presently, after a pause, and in a
very sad voice. Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke, and she turned
away her head.
You owe ice hcr ages I suppose,'' sail the Peer.
Worse than that,'' said Becky, still casting down her eyes, " I hae
ruined her.''

asked.
Men do that,'' Becky answered bitterly.  Women are not so bad
as you. Lust year when we were reduced to our last guinea, she gave us
very thing. She shall never leave me, until we are ruined utterly our-
selves, which does not seem far of, or until I can pay her the uttermost
farthing.''
:- it, how much is it?'' said the Peer with an oath. And Becky,
reflecting on the largeness of his means, mentioned not only the sum
which she had borrowed from MIss Briggs, but one of nearly double the
amount.
This caused the Lord Steyne to break out in another brief and ever-
getic expression of anger, at which Rebecca held down her head the more,
and tried bitterly. ``I could not help it. It was my only chance. I dare
not tell my husband. HE would kill me if I told him what I have
done. I have kept it a secret from every body but you-and you forced
it from e. Ah, what shall I do, Lord Steyne? for I am very, very
unhappy ?''
Lord Stleyne made no reply except by beating the deal's tattoo, and
biting his nails. At last he clapt his hat on his head, and flung out of
the room. Rebecca did not rise from her attitude of misery until the door
slammed upon him, and his carriage whirled away. Then she rose up with
the everest expression of victorious mischief glittering in her green eyes.
She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as she sat at work; and
sitting down to the piano, she rattled away a triumphant voluntary on
the keys, which made the people pause under her window to listen to her
brilliant music.

A NOVEL WITHOUT A IIE0.
433
That night, there came two notes from Gaunt House for the little
woman, the one containing a card of invitation from Lord and Lady
Steyne to a dinner nt Gaunt House next Friday: while the other enclosed
a slip of gray paper bearing Lord tyne's signature and the address of
Messrs. Jones, Brown, and Robinson, Lombard Street.
Rawdon heard becky laughing in the night once or twice. It was
only her delight at going to Gaunt House and facing the ladies there,
she said, which amused hero. But the truth was, that she was occupied
with a great number of other thoughts. Should she pay off old Briggs
and gie ler her cong6f Should she astonish Baggles by settling his
account? She turned over all these thoughts on her pillow, and on the
next day, when Rawdon went out to pay his morning visit to the Club,
Mrs. Crawley (in a modest dress with a veil on) whipped off in a hackney-
conch to the City: and being landed at Mess. Jones and Robinson's
bank, presented a document there to the authority at the desk, who, in
reply, asked her `` How she would take it S''
She gently said ``she would take a hundred and fifty pounds in small
notes and the remainder in one noted:'' and passing through St. Paul's
Church and stopped there and bought the handsomest black silk own
for Briggs which only could buy; and which, with a kiss and the
kindest speeches, she presented to the simple old spinster.
Then she walked to Mr. Raggles, inquired about his children affection-
lately, and gave him fifty pounds on account. Then she went to the
livery-man from whom sle robbed her carriages and gratified him with
similar sum. `' And I hope this will be a lesson to you, Spain,'' she
said, `` and that on the next drawing-room d my brother, Sir Pitt,
will not be inconvenienteed by being obliged to take four of us in his
carriage to wait upon His Majesty, beeuse my on carriage is not forth-
coming.'' It appears there had been a dillerefee on the last drawing-
room day. HEnce the degradation which the Colonel had almost suffered,
of being obliged to enter the presence of his Sovereign in a hack club.
These arrangements concluded, BEcky paid a visit up-stairs to the
before-mentioned desk, which Amelia Sedley lad given her years and
years ago, and which contained a number of useful and valuable little
things: in which private museum she placed the one note which Messrs.
Jones and RObinson's cashier had given ler.

THEN the ladies of Gaunt House
were at breakfast that morning,

turned the females of his house-

public days, or when they crossed
each other in the hall, or when
from his pit-box at the Opera he

a battle royal ensued apropos ol

Style said in a flutter. `Lady
Gaunt writes them.''
 I will not write to that person,'' Lady Want and, a tall nd states
lady, who looked up for an instant and then down again after she had
spoken. It was not good to meet Lord Steync's eyes for those who had
offended him.
 Send the children out of the room. Go.'' said he, pulling at the
bell-rope. The urchins, always frightened before him, retired : their mother
would have followed too.  Not you,'' he said.  You stop.''

you; and George's wife is the only person in the family who doesn't wish
you were lead. Gaunt would marry again if you were.''
I wish I were,'' her Lnadyship answered, with tears and rage in her
eyes.
You, forsyth, must give yourself airs of virtue; while my wife, who is
an immaculate saint, as everybody knows, and never did wrong in her life,
has no objection to meet my young friend, Mrs. Crawley. My Lady
Steyne knows that appearances are sometimes against the best of women;
that lies are often told about the most innocent of them. Pray, Madam,
shall I tell you some little anecdotes about my Lady Breweries, your
mamma P''
You may strike me if you like, Sir, or hit any cruel blow,'' Lady
Gaunt said. To see his wife and daughter suffering always put his Lord-
ship into a good humour.
 My sweet Blanche,'' he said, `:'I am a gentleman, and never lay
ny hand upon a woman, are in the way of kindness. I only wish to
correct little faults in your character. You women are too proud, and
sadly lack humility, as Father Mole, I'm sure, would tell my Lady
Steynce if he were here. You mustn't give yourselves airs: you must be
meek and humble, my blessings. For all Lady Steyne knows, this cnlum-
united, simple, good-humoured Mrs. Crawley, is quite innocent-ecn
more innocent than herself. Her husband's character is not good, but it
is as good as Breweries', who has played a little and not played a great deal,
who cheated you out of the only legacy you ever had, and left you a
paper on my hands. And Mrs. Crawley is not very well born; but she
is not worse than Funny's illustrious ancestor, the first de la Jones,''
The money which I brought into the family, Sir,'' Lady George
cried out-
on purchased n contingent reversion with it,'' the Marquis said,
darkly. t If Gaunt dies, your husband may come to his honours; your
little boys may inherit them, and who knows what besides In the
meanwhile, ladies, be as proud and virtuous as you like abroad, but don't
give me any airs. As for Mrs. Crawley's character, I shan't demean
myself, or that most spotless and perfectly irreprochable lady, by even
hinting that it requires a defence. You will be pleased to receive her
with the utmost cordiality, as you will receive all persons whom I present
in this house. This house'' He broke out with a laugh. :Who is the
master of it and what is it This Temple of Virtue bElongs to me.
And if I invite all Negate or all Bedlam here, by - ty shall be

After this vigorous allocation, to one of which sort Lord Stcyne treated
his ``MAureen,'' whenever symptoms of insubordination appeared in his
household, the crest-fallen women had nothing for it but to obey. Lady
Gaunt wrote the invitation which his Lordship required, and she and her
mother-in-law drove in person, and with bitter and humiliated hearts, to
leave the cards on Mrs. Rawdon, the reception of which causal that
innocent woman so much pleasure.
There were families in London who would have sacrificed a year's
income to receive such an honour at the hands of those great ladies.

eMPTY FAIR.
Mr. Frederick Bullock, for instance, would have gone on her knees from
Mayfair to Lombard Street, if Lady Steyue and Lady Gaunt had been
waiting in the City to raise her up, and soy,``Come to us next Friday,''
-not to one of the great crushes, and grand balls of Gaunt House,
whither everybody went, but to the sacred, unapproachable, mysterious,
delicious entertainments, to be admitted to one of which was a privilege,
and an honour, and a blessing indeed.
Severe, spotless, and beautiful, Lady Gaunt held the very highest rank
in Vanity Fair. The distinguished courtesy with which Lord Steyne
treated her, charmed everybody who witnessed his behaviour, caused the
severest critics to admit how perfect a gentleman he was, and to own
that his Lordship's heart at least was in the right place.
The Ladies of Gaunt House called Lazy Bareacrcs into their aid, in
order to repulse the common enemy. One of Lady Gaunt's carriages
went to IIill Street for hcr Ladyslip's mother, all whose equipages were
in the hands of the bailiffs, whose very jewels and wardrobe, it was said,
had been seized by those inexorable Israelites. Breaches Castle was
theirs, too, with all its costly pictures, furniture, and articles of rti-the
magnificent Vandykes; the noble Reynolds' pictures; the Lawrence por-
traits, tawdry and beautiful, and, thirty years ago, deemed as precious as
works of real genius; the matchless Dancing Nymph of Canova, for which
Lady Breaches had site in her youth-Lady laureates splendid then, and
radiant in wealth, rank, and beauty-a toothless, bald, old woman now-
a mere rag of a former role of state. Her Lord, painted at the same
time by Lawrence, as waving his sabre in front of Breaches Castle, and
clothed in his uniform of Colonel of the Thiatlewood eomanry, was a
withered, old, lean man in a great court and a bRutus wig: slinking about
Gray's Inn of mornings chiefly, and dining alone at clubs. He did not
like to dine with Steyne now. They had run races of pleasure together
in youth when Bnrencres was the winner. But Steyne hal more bottom
than he, and had lasted him out. he MArquis was ten times a greater
man now than the young Lord Gaunt of'85; and Breaches nowhere in
the race-old, beaten, bankrupt, and broken down. He had borrowed
too much money of 3tyne to find it pleasant to meet his old comrade
often. The latter, whenever he wished to be merry, used seemingly to
ask INdy Gaunt, why her father had not come to see her : He has
not been here for four months,'' Lord Steyne would say. ``I cnn always
tell by my cheque-book afterwards, when I get a visit from Barescres.
What a comfort it is, my Ladies, I bank with one of my sons' fathers-in-laws,
and the other banks with men'
Of the other illustrious persons whom Becky had the honour to
encounter on this her first presentation to the grand world, it does not
become the present historian to say much. There was his Excellency the
Prince of Peterwsaradin, with his Princess; a nobleman tightly girthed,
with a large military chest, on which the lake of his order phone magna-
recently, and wearing the red collar of the Golden Fleece round his neck.
He was the owner of countless flocks. `` Look at his face. I think he
must be descended from a sheep,'' BEcky whispered to Lord Steyne.

437
Indeed, his Excellency's countenanee, long, solemn, and white, with the
ornament round his neck, bore some resemblance to that of a venerable
bell-wether.
There was Mr. John Pul Jefferson Jones, titular attached to the
American Embassy, and correspondent of the New York Demagogue;
who, by way of making himself agreeable to the company, asked Lady
Steyne, during a pause in the conversation at dinner, how his dear friend,
George Gaunt, liked the Brazil -lIe and George had been most intimate
at Naples, and had gone up Vesuvius together, Mr. Jones wrote a full and
particular account of the dinner, which appeared duly in the dEmagogue.
He mentioned the names and titles of all the guests, giving biographical
sketches of the principal people. lIe described the persons of the ladies
with great eloquence; the service of the table: the size and costume of
the servants: enumerated the dishes and wines served: the ornaments of the
side-board, and the probable value of the plate. Such a dinner he calculated
could not e dialed up under fifteen or eighteen dollars per head. And
he was in the habit, until very lately, of sending over protege, with letters
of recommendation to the present Marquis of intense, encouraged to do
so by the intimate terms on which he had lived with his dear friend,
the late lord. lIe was most indignant that a young and insignificant
aristocrat, the Earl of touchdown, should have taken the as of him in this
profession to the dining room. ``Just as i was stepping up to offer my
hand to a very pleasing and witty fashionable, the brilliant and club-
sive Mrs. Rawdon Crawley''-he wrote-'`the young patrician inter-
used between me and the lady, and whisked my helen off without a
word of apology. I was fuain to bring up the car with the Colonel, the
lady's husband, a stout red-faced warrior who distinguished himself at
Waterloo, where he had better luck than field some of his brother red-
coals at New Orleans,''
The Colonel's countenance on coming into this polite society wore a
many bushes as the face of a boy of sixteen assumes when he is on-
fronted with his sister's schoolfellows. It has been told before that
honest Rawdan has not been much used at any period of his life to ladies'
company. With the men at the Club or the Mess-room, he was well
enough; and could rile, bet, smoke, or play at billiards with the oldest of
them. IIe had had his time for female friendships too: but that was
twenty years ago, and the ladies were of the rank of those with whom
Young Marlow in the comedy is represented as having been familiar
before he became abashed in the presence of Miss Harlenstle. The times
are such that one scarcely dares to allude to that kind of company which
thousands of our young men in Vanity Fair are frequenting every day,
which nightly fills casinos and dancing-rooms, which is known to exist as
well as the Ring in Hyde Park or the Congregation at St. James's-but
which the most squeamish if not the most moral of societies is determined
to ignore. In a word, although Colonel Crawley was now five-and-forty
years of age, it had not been his lot in life to meet with a half dozen good
women, besides his paragon of a wife. All except her and his kind sister
Lady Jane, whose gentle nature had timed and won him, scared the

UNIT FAIR.
worthy Colonel: and on occasion of his first dinner at Gaunt House
he was not heard to make a single remark except to state that the weather
was very hot. Indeed Becky would have left him at home, but that
virtue ordained that her husband should be by her side to protect the
timid and fluttering little creature on her first appearance in polite
society.
On her first appearance Lord Steyne stepped forward, taking her hand,
and greeting er with great courtesy, and presenting her to Lady Steyne
and their ladyships, her daughters. Their ladyships made three stately
courses, and the elder lady to be sure gave her hand to the new comer,
but it was as cold and lifeless as marble.
Becky took it, however, with grateful humility; and performing a
reverence which would have done credit to the best dancing master, put
herself at Lady Steyne's feet, as it were, by saying that his Lordship had
been her father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Becky, had
learned to honour and respect the Steyne family from the days of her
cluildhool. The fact is, that Lord Steyne had once purchased a couple
of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could neer
Forget her gratitude for that favour.
The Lady Breaches then came under Becky's eoguizance-to whom
the Colonel's lady made also a most respectful obeisance : it was returned
with severe dignity by the exalted person in question.
I had the pleasure of making your Ladyship's acquaintance at
Brussels, ten years ago,'' Becky said, in the most winning manner. I
had the good fortune to meet lAdy Breaches, at the Duchess of Rich-
mond's ball, the night before the battle of Waterloo. And I recollect
your gandhi, and my Lady Blanche, your daughter, sitting in the csr-
ridge in the porte-cochire at the Inn, waiting for horses. I hope your
LAdyship's diamonds are safe,''
Everybody's eyes looked into their neighbour's. Thc famous diamonds
had undergone a famous seizure, it appears, about which Becky, of
course, knew nothing. Rawdon Crawley retreated with Lord Touchdown
into a window, where the latter was heard to laugh immoderately, as
Rawdon told him the story of Lady Breaches wanting losses, and
`knuekling down by Joe,' to Mr. Crawley. 'I think I needn't be
afraid of that woman,'' Becky thought. Indeed, Lady Breaches
exchanged terrified and angry looks with her daughter; and retreated
to a table, where she began to look at pictures with great energy.
When the Potentate from the Danube male his appearance, the
conversation was carried on in the French language, and the Lady
Breaches and the younger allies found, to their farther mortification,
that Mrs. Crawley was much better acquainted with that tongue, and
spoke it with a much better accent than they. Becky had met other
Hungarian magnates with the army in France, in 18l6-17. She asked
after her friends with great interest. The foreign personages thought
that she was a lady of great distinction; and the Prince and the Princess
asked severally of Lord Steyne and the Marchioness, whom they conducted
to dinner, who was that petite dame who spoke so well

But it was when the ladies were alone that Becky knew the tug of war
would come. And then indeed the little woman found herself in such a
situation, as made her acknowledge the correctness of Lord Steyne's
caution to her to beware of the society of ladies above her own sphere.
As they say the persons who hate Irishmen most are Irishmen; so,
assuredly, the greatest tyrants over women are women. When poor little
Becky, alone with the ladies, went up to the fire-place whither the great
ladies had repaired, the great ladies marched away and took possession of
a table of drawings. When Becky followed them to the table of drawings
they dropped off one by one to the fire again. She tried to speak to one
of the children (of whom she is commonly found in public places,) but

BRYANT FAIR.
MAster George Gaunt was called away by his mamma; and the stranger
was treated with such cruelly finally, that even Lady Steyne herself pitied
her, and went up to speak to the friendless little woman.
Lord Steyne,'' said her Ladyship, as her wan cheeks glowed with
a blush, `` says you sing and play very beautifully, Mrs. Crawley-I wish
you would do me the kindness to sing to me.''
I will do anything that may gie pleasure to my Lord Steyne or to
you,'' said Rebecca, sincerely grateful, und seating herself at the piano,
began to sing.
She sang religious songs of Mozart, which had been early favourites of
Lady Stcyne, and with such sweetness and tenderness that the lady
lingering round the piano, sate down by its side, and listened until the
tears rolled down her eyes. It is true that the opposition ladies at the
other end of the room kept up a loud and ceeaseless buzzing and talking:
but the Lady Steyne did not hear those rumours. She was a child again
--and had wandered back through a forty years' wilderness to her Convent
Garden. The chapel organ had sealed the same tones, the organist, the
sister whom she loved best of the community, had taught them to her in
those carly happy days. he was a girl once more, and the brief period
of her happiness bloomed out again for an hour-she started when the
jarring doors were flung open, and with a loud laugh from Lord Steyne,
the men of the party entered full of gaiety.
IIe saw at a glance what had happened in his absence: and was grate-
ful to his wife for one. He went and spoke to her, and called her by her
Christin name, so as again to bring bushes to her ple face-``My wife
says you have been singing like an angel,'' he said to Becky. Now there
are angels of two kinds, and both sorts, it is said, are charming in
their way.
WHatever the previous portion of the evening had been, the rest of that
night was a great triumph for Becky. She sang her very best, and it was
so good that every one of the men came and crowded round the piano.
The women, hcr enemies, were left quite alone. And Mr. Paul Jefferson
Jones thought he had made a conquest of Lady Gunt by going up to her
ILndyship, and praising her delightful friend's first-rate singing.

tory must now descend from
the genteel heights in which
she has been soaring, and have
the goodness to drop down
on the lowly roof of John
Sedley nt Brompton, and dc-
serie what events are taking
place there. IIere too, in this
humble tenement, live care,
and distrust, and dismay. Mrs.
Clpp in the kitchen is gru-
bling in secret to her husband
about the rent, and urging the
good fellow to rebel against his
old friend and patron and his
present lodger. Mrs. Sedley has ceased to visit her landlady in the lower
regions no, and indeed is in a position to patronise Mrs. Clapp no
longer. Now in one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes
a matter of forty pound, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for
the money The Irish maidservant has not altered in the least in her
kind and respectful behaviour; but Mrs. Sedley fancies that she is growing
insolent and ungrateful, and, as the guilty thief who fears each bush an
officer, sees threatening innuendoes and hints of capture in all the girl's
speeches and answers. Miss Clapp, grown quite a young woman now, is
declared by the soured old lady to be an unbearable and impudent little
minx. Why Amelia can be so fond of her, or have her in her room so
much, or walk out with her so constantly, Mrs, Sedley cannot conceive.
The bitterness of poverty hs poisoned the life of the once cheerful and
kindly woman. She is tlankless for Amelia's constant and gentle bearing
towards hcr; carps nt her for her efforts at kindness or service; rails at
her for her silly pride in her child, and her neglect of her parents. Georgy's
house is not a very lively one since uncle Jos's annuity has been withdrawn,
and the little family are almost upon famine diet.
Amelia thinks, and thinks, and ranks her brain, to find some means of
increasing the small pittance upon which the household is starving. Cnn
she give lessons in anything? paint card-racks? do fine work? She finds
that women are working hard, and better than she can, for opulence
a-day. She buys a couple of built Bristol boards and the Fancy Stationed's,
442

and paints her very best upon them-a shepherd with a red waistcoat
on one, and a pink face smiling in the midst of a pencil landscape-a
slepherdess on the other, crossing a little bridge, with a little dog, nicely
shaded. the man of the Fancy repository and Brompton Emporium of
Fine Arts, (of whom she bought the screens, vainly hoping that he would
re-purchase them when ornamented by her hand), can hardly hide the sneer
with which he examines these feeble works of art. He looks balance at the
lady who waits in the shop, and ties up the cards again in their envelope of
whitey-brown paper, and hands them to the poor wilson and Miss Clapp,
who had never seen such beautiful things in her life, and nd been quite
confident that the man must give at least two guiness for the screens.
They try at other shops in the interior of London, with faint sickening
hopes. `` Dont want 'em,'' says one.  Be off,'' says another fiercely.
Three and sixpence have been spent in vain-the screens retire to Miss
Clapp's bel-room, who persists in thinking them lonely.
She writes out a little card in her nearest had, and after long thought
and labour of composition; in which the public is informed that'`A Lady
who has some time at her disposal, wishes to undertake the education of
some little girls, whom she would instruct in English, in French, in
Geography, in History, and in Music-address A. O., at Mr. Brown's;''
and she confides the card to the gentleman of the Fine Art Repository, who
consents to allow it to lie upon the counter, where it grows dingy and
flyblown. Amelia passes the door wistfully many a tie, in hopes that
Mr, Brown will have some news to give her ; but he never beckons her in.
When she goes to make little purchases, there is no news for her. Poor
simple lady, tender and weak-how are you to battle with the struggling,
violent world
She grows daily more care-work and sad : fixing upon her child alarmed
eyes, whereof the little boy cannot interpret the expression. She starts up
of a night and peeps into his room stealthily, to see that he is sleeping and
not stolen away. She sleeps but little now. A constant thought and
terror is haunting her. How she weeps and prays in the long silent nights,
-how she tries to hide from herself the thought which will return to her,
that she ought to part with the boy,-that she is the only barrier between
him and prosperity. She can't, she can'tO Not now, at least. Some
other day. Ohl it is too hard to think of and to bear.
A thought comes over her which makes her blush and turn from herself,
--her parents might keep the annuity-the curate would marry her and
give a home to her and the boy. But George's picture and dearest memory
are there to rebuke her., Shame and loe say no to the sacrifice. She
shrinks from it as from something unholy; and such thoughts never found
a resting-place in that pure and gentle bosom.
The combat, which we describe in a sentence or two, lasted for many
weeks in poor Amelia's heart: during which, she had no confidante: indeed,
she would have none : as she would not allow to herself the possibility of
yielding: though she was giving way daily before the enemy ith whom
she had to battle. One truth after another was marshalling itself silently
against her, and keeping its ground. Poverty and misery for all, want and
degradation for her parents, injustice to the boy-one by one the networks

of the little citadel were taken, in which the poor soul passionately guarded
her only love and treasure.
At the beginning of the struggle, she had written off a letter of tender
supplication to her brother at Calcutta, imploring him not to withdraw the
support which he had granted to their parents, and painting in terms of
unless pathos their lonely and hapless condition. She did not know the
truth of the matter. The payment of Jos's annuity was still regular: but
it was a money-lender in the city who was receiving it : old Sedley had sold
it for a sum of money wherewith to prosecute his bootless schemes. lemmy
was calculating eagerly the time that would elapse before the letter would
arrive and be answered. She had written down the date in her pocket-book
of the day when she dispatched it. To her son's guardian, the good Major
nt Madras, she had not communicated any of her griefs and perplexitics.
She had not written to him since she wrote to congratulate him on his
approaching marriage. She thought with sickening despondeney, that that
friend,-the only one, the one who had felt such a regard for her,-was
fallen away.
One day, when things had come to a very bad pass-when the creditors
were pressing, the mother in hysteria grief, the father in more than usual
gloom, the inmates of the family avoiding each other, each secretly
oppressed with his private unhappiness and notion of wrong-the father
and daughter happened to be left alone together; and Amelia thought to
comfort her father, by telling him what she had done. She had written
to Joseph-an answer must come in three or four months. He was
always generous, though careless. IIe could not refuse, when he knew
how struitened the circumstances of his parents.
Then the poor old gentleman revealed the whole truth to her-that
his son was still paying the annuity, which his own imprudence had flung
away. He had not dared to tell it sooner. IIe thought Amelia's ghastly
and terrified look, when, with a trembling, miserable voice he made the
confession, conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment. ``Ahl''
sid he, with quivering lips and turning away, ``you despise your old
father now.''
O Papal it is not that,'' Amelia cried out, falling on his neck, and
kissing him many times.  You are always good and kind. You did it
for the best. It is not for the money-it is-TO my God my God1
havre mercy upon me, and give me strength to bear this trial;'' and she
kissed him again wildly, and went away.
Still the father did not know what that explanation meant, and the
burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him. It was that she was
conquered. The sentence was passed. The child must go from her-to
others-to forget her. Her heart and her treasure-her joy, hope, love,
worship-her God, almost She must give him up; and then-and then
she would go to George; and they would watch over the child, and wait
for him until he came to them in Heaven.
She put on her bonnet, scarcely knowing what she did, and went out to
walk in the lanes by which George used to come back from school, and
where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy. It
was May, a half holiday. The leaves were all coming out, the weather

was brilliant: the boy came running to her, flushed with health, singing,
his bundle of school-books hanging by n thong. There he was. Both
her arms were round him. No, it was impossible. They could not be
going to part.  What is the matter, mother :'' said he; `` you look
very pale.''
 Nothing, my child,'' she said, and atooped down and kissed him.
That night Amelia made the hoy real the story of Samuel to her, and
how Hannah, his mother, having weaned him, brought him to Eli the high
priest to minister before the Lord. And he read the song of gratitude
which Hannah sang: and which says, Who it is who maketh poor anl
maketh rich, and bridget low and exalted-how the poor shall be raised
up out of the dust, and how, in his own might, not man shall be strong.
Then he read how Samuel's mother made him a little coat, and brought
it to him from year to year when she came up to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And then, in her sweet simple way, George's mother made commentaries
to the boy upon this affecting story. How Hannah, though she loved
her son so much, yet gave him p because of her vow. And how she
must always have thought of him as she sat at home, far away, making
the little coat: and Samuel, she was sure, never forgot his mother: and
how happy she must have been as the time came (and the years pass away
very quick) when she should see her boy, and how good and wise he
had grown. This little sermon she spoke with a gentle solemn voice,
and dry eyes, until she came to the account of their meeting-then the
discourse broke off suddenly, the tender heart overflowed, and taking the
boy to her breast, she rocked him in her arms, and went silently over him
in a silent agony of tears.
ler mind being made up, the widow began to take such measures as
seemed right to her for advancing the end which she proposed. One day,
MIss Osborne, in Russell square, (Amelia had not written the name or
number of the house for ten years-her youth, her early story came back
to her as she wrote the superscription)-one day Miss Osborne got a letter
from Amelia, which made her blush very much and look towards her father,
sitting grooming in his place at the other end of the table.
In simple terms, Amelia told her the reasons which had induced her to
change her mind respecting her boy. Her father had met with fresh mis-
fortunes, which had entirely ruined him. Her own pittance was aso small
that it would barely enable her to support her parents, and would not sue-
fice to give George the advantages which were his due. Great as her
sufferings would be at parting with him, she would, by God's help, endure
them for the boy's sake. She knew that those to whom he was being,
would do all in their power to make him happy. She described his disco-
sition, such as she fancied it; quick and impatient of control or harshness;
easily to be moved by love and kindness. In a postscript, she stipulated
that she should have a written agreement, that she should see the child as
often as she wished,-she could not part with him under any other terms.
What Mrs. Pride has come down, has she ?'' old Osborne said, when
with n tremulous eager voice Miss Osborne read him the letter-''Regular
starved out, hey ha, hal I knew she would.'' He tried to keep his

dignity and to read his paper as usul,-but he could not follow it. IHIe
chuckled and swore to himself behind the sheet.
At last he flung it down: and scowling at his daughter, as his wont was,
went out of the room into his study adjoining, from whence he presently
returned with a key. He flung it to Miss Osborne.
`:Get the room over mine-his room that was-ready,'' he said.
 Yes, sir,'' his daughter replied in a tremble. It was George's room.
It had not been opened for more than ten years. Some of his clothes,
papers, handkerchiefs, whips and caps, fishing-rods and sporting gear,
were still there. An army list of 1814, with his name written on the
cover; a little dictionary he was wont to use in writing; and the Bill
his mother had given him, were on the mantel-piece; with a pair of spurs,
and a dried instead covered with the dust of ten years. Ahl since that
in was wet, what days and people had passed away The writing-book
still on the table, was blotted with his hand.
MIss Osborne was much affected when she first entered this room with
the servants under her. She sank quite pale on the little bed. This is
blessed news, mam-indeed, mm,'' the housekeeper said; `` and the
good old times is returning, mam. The denr little feller, to be sure,
mam; how happy he will be But some folks in May Fair, mam, will
owe him a grudge, mam;'' and she clicked back the bolt which held the
window-sash, and let the air into the chamber.
 You had better send that woman some money,'' Mr. Osborne said,
before he went out. `She shan't want for nothing. Send her a hundred
pound.''
`An I 'll go and see her to-morro ?'' Miss Osborne asked.
That 's your look out. She don't come in here, mind. No, by-,
not for all the money in London. But she mustn't want now. So look
out, and get things right.'' With which brief speeches Mr. Osborne
took lease of his daughter, and went on his accustomed way into the City.
e Here, Papa, is some money,'' Amelia said that night, kissing the old
man, her father, and putting a bill for a hundred pounds into his hands.
 And-and, Mammon, don't be harsh with Georgy. He-he is not
going to stop with us long.'' She could say nothing more, and walked
away silently to her roo. Let us close it upon her prayers and her
sorrow. I think we had best speak little about so much love and grief.
Miss Osborne came the next day, according to the promise contained
in her note, and saw Amelia. The meeting between them was friends.
A look and a few words from Miss Osborne showed the poor widow, that,
with regard to this woman at least, there need be no fear lest she should
take the first place in her son's affection. She was cold, sensible, not
unkinl. The mother had not been so well pleased, perhaps, had the rival
been better looking, younger, ore affectionate, warmer-hearted. Miss
Osborne, on the other hand, thought of old times and memories, and
could not but be touched with the poor mother's pitiful situation. Bhe
was conquered, and, laying down her arms as it were: she humbly sub-
mattel. That lay they arranged together the preliminaries of the treaty
of capitulation.
George was kept from school the next day, and saw his aunt. Amelia
let them alone together, and went to her room. She was trying the
446

separation :-as that poor gentle Lady Jane Grey felt the edge of the axe
that was to come down and never her slender life. Days were passed in
parlcys, visits, preparations. The widow broke the matter to Georgy
with great caution; she looked to see him very much affected by the
intelligence. He was rather elated than otherwise, and the poor woman
turned sadly away. He bragged about the news that day to the boys at
school ; told them how he was going to live with his grandpa, his
father's father, not the one who comes here sometimes; and that he
would be very rich, and have a carriage, and a money, and go to a much
finer school, and when he was rich he would buy Leader's pencil-case, and
pay the tart woman. The boy was the image of his father, as his fond
mother thought.
Indeed I have no heart, on account of our dear Amelia's sake, to go
through the story of George's last days at home.
At Last the day came, the carriage drove up, the little humble packets
containing tokens of love and remembrance were ready and disposed in the
hall long since-George was in his new suit, for which the tailor had come
previously to measure him. He had sprung up with the sun and put on
the new clothes; his mother hearing him from the room close by, in which
she had been lying, in speechless grief and watching. Days before she
had been making preparations for the end : purchasing little stores for the
boy's use; marking his hooks and linen; talking with him and preparing
him for the change-fondly fancying that he needed preparation.
So that he had change, what cared he He was longing for it. By
thousand eager declarations as to what he would do, when he went to lie
with his grandfather, he had shown the poor widow how little the idea of
parting had cost him down.  He would come and see his mamma often
on the money,'' he said: ``he would come and fetch her in the carriage;
they would drive in the Park, and sle should have everything she wanted.''
The poor roller was fair to content herself with these selfish demonstra-
tions of attachment, and tried to convince herself how sincerely her son
loved her. He must loe her. All children were so: a little anxious
for novelty, and-no, not selfish, but self-killed. Her child must have his
enjoyments and ambition in the world. She herself, by her own selfishness1
and imprudent love for him, had denied him his just rights and pleasures
hitherto.
I know few things more affecting than that timorous debasement and
self-humiliation of a woman. How she owns that it is she and not the
man who is guilty: how she takes all the faults on her side: how the
courts in a manner punishment for the wrongs which she has not com-
emitted, and persists in shielding the real culprit It is those who injure
women who get the most kindness from them-they are born timid and
tyrants, and maltrcat those who are humblest before them.
So poor Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her son's
departure, and had passed many and many a long solitary hour in making
preparations for the end. George stood by his mother, watching her arrange-
ments without the least concern. Tears had fallen into his boxes; passages
had been scored in his favourite books: old toys, relics, treasures had been
hoarded away for him, and packed with strange neatness and care,-and
of all these things the boy took no note. The child goes away smiling

as the mother breaks her heart. By heavens it is pitiful, the bootless lot
of women for children in Vanity Fair.
A few days are past: and the great event of Amelia's life is consume-
mated. No angel has intervened. The child is sacrificed and offered up
to fate: and the widow is quite alone.
The boy comes to see her often, to be sure. He rides on a money with
the bachman behind him, to the delight of his old grandfather, Sedley,
who walks proudly down the line by his side. She sees him, but he s not
her boy any more. Why, he rides to see the boys at the little school, too,
and to show off before them his new wealth and splendour. In two
days he has adopted a slight imperious air and patronising manner. He
was born to command, his mother thinks, as his father was before him.
It is fine weather now. Of evenings on the days when he does not

house. It is so pleasant and cool. She can look up and see the drawing-
room windows illuminated, and, at about nine o'clock, the chamber in the
upper story where Georgy sleeps. She knows-He has told her. She
prays there as the light goes out, prays with a humble humble heart,
and walks home shrinking and silent. She is very tired when she comes
home. Perhaps she will sleep the better for that long weary walk; and
she may dream about Georgy.
One Sunday she happened to be walking in RUssell-square, at some dis-
dance from Mr, Osborne's house (she could see it from a distance though)
when all the bells of Sabbath were ringing, and George and his aunt
came out to go to church; a little sweep asked for charity, and the footman,
who carried the books, tried to drive him away; but Georgy stopped and
gave him money. May God's blessing be on the boy1 Emmy ran round
the square, and coming up to the sweep, gave him her mite too. All the
bells of sabbath were ringing, and she followed them until she came to the
founding Church, into which she went. There she sat in a place whence
sec could see the head of the boy under his father's tombstone. Many
hundred fresh children's voices rose up there and segments to the Father
Benedict; and little George's soul thrilled with light at the burst of
glorious psalmoly. 1Iis other could not see him for awhile, through
the is that died ler eyes.

very greatest and tallest doors
in the metropolis were speedily
opened to her-doors so great

brethren, let us tremble before
those august portals. I fancy
them guarded by grooms of the

with which they prong all those

hall and takes down the names of
the great ones who are admitted
to the feasts, dies after a little
time. He can't survive the
glare of fashion long. It searches
him up, as the presence of Jupiter in full dress wasted that poor input-
dent Semele-a giddy moth of a creature who ruined herself by venturing
out of her natural atmosphere. Her myth ought to be taken to heart
amongst the Burundians, the Belgravians,-her story, and perhaps Becky's
too. Ah, ladies l-s the ordered Mr. Thriller if Belgravia is not a
sounding brass, and Tyburnia a tingling cymbal. These are vanities.
Even these will pass away. And some day or other (but it will be after

Colonel Crawley, when they met on the next day at the Club, and to
compliment Mrs. Crawley in the Ring of de Park with a profound
salute of the hat. She and her husband were invited immediately to one
of the Prince's sall parties at Levant House, then occupied by his
Highness during the temporary absence from England of its noble
proprietor. She sung after dinner to a very little comte. The Marquis
of Steyne was present, paternally superintendent the progress of his pupil.
At Levant House Becky met one of the finest gentlemen and greatest
ministers that Europe has produced-the Due de ls Jabotiire, then
Ambassador from the Most Christian King, and subsequently Minister to
that monarch. I declare I swell with pride as these august names are
transcribed by my pen; and I think in what brilliant company my dear
Becky is moving. She became a constant guest at the French Embassy,
where no party was considered to be complete without the presence of the
charming Madame Brandon Crawley.
Messieurs de Truffigny (of the Perigord family) and Champaign, both
attaches of the Embassy, were straightaway smitten by the charms of the
fair Colonel's wife : and both declared, according to the wont of this
nation, (for who ever yet met a Frenchman, come out of England, that
has not left half a dozen families miserable, and brought away as many
hearts in his pocket-book of) both, I say, declared that they were au mies
with the charming Madame Brandon.
But I doubt the correctness of the assertion. Champaign was very

fond of carte, and made many parties with the Colonel of evenings,
while Becky was singing to Lor weyne in the other room; and as for
Truffigny, it is a well-known fact that he dared not go to the Travellers',
where he owed money to the waters, and if he had not and the Embassy
s a dining-place, the worthy young gentlemen must have starved.
I doubt, I say, that Becky would have selected either of these young
men as a person on whom she would bestow her special regard. They
ran of her messages, purchased her gloves and flowers, went in debt for
opera-homes for her, and made themselves amiable in a thousand ways.
And they talked English with adorable simplicity, and to the constant
amusement of Becky and my Lord Steyne. She would mimic one or
other to his face, and compliment him on his advance in the English
language with a gravity which never failed to tackle the Marquis, her
sardonic old patron. Truffiguy gave Briggs a shawl by way of winning
over BEcky's confidante, and asked her to take charge of a letter which
the simple spinster handed over in public to the person to whom it was
addressed; and the composition of which amused everybody who read it
greatly. Lord Steyne read it : everybody, but honest Rawdon; to whom
it was not necessary to tell everything that passed in the little house in
May Fair.
Here, before long, Becky received not only `'the best'' foreigners (as
the phrase is in our noble and admirable society slang), but some of the
best English people too. I dont mean the most virtuous, or indeed the
least virtuous, or the cleverest, or the stupidest, or the richest, or the best
born, but ``the best,''-in a word, people about whom there is no question
-such as the great Lady Fit-Willis, that Patron Saint of Black's, the
great Lady Slowbore, the great Lady Gabriel Macbeth, (she was Ludy
G. Glory, daughter of Lord Grey of Glory,) and the like. When the
Countess of Fitz-Willis (her ldyship is of the Longstreet family, see
Debrett and Burke,) takes up a person, he or she is safe. There is no
question about them any more. Not that my Lady Fitz-Willis is any better
than anybody else, being, on the contrary, a faded person, fifty-seven years
of age, and neither handsome, nor wealthy, nor entertaining; but it is
agreed on all sides that she is of the ``best people. Those who go to her
are of the best: and from an old grudge'' probably to Lady Steyne (Jor
whose coronet her ladyslip, then the youthful Georgina Frelerica, daughter
of the Prince of Wales's favourite, the Earl of Portansherry, had once tried),
this great and famous leader of the fashion chose to acknowledge Mrs. Run-
don Crawley: made her a most marked curtsey at the assembly over which
she presided: and not only encouraged her son, St. Kitts (his lordship got
his place through Lord Steyne's interest), to frequent Mrs. Crawley's house,
but asked her to her own mansion, and spoke to her twice in the most
public and condescending manner during dinner. The important fact was
known all over London that night. People who had been crying fie
about Mrs. Crawley, were silent. Denham, the wit and lawyer, Lord
Steyne's right-hand man, went about everywhere praising her: some
who had hesitated, came forward at once and welcomed her: little Tom

admitted to be among the ``best'' people. Ah, my beloved readers and
brethren, do not envy poor Becky prematurely-glory like this is said to
be fugitive. It is currently reported that even in the very inmost circles,
they are no happier than the poor wanderers outside the zone; and Becky,
who penetrated into the very centre of fashion, and saw the great George IV.
face to face, has owned since that there too was Vanity.
We must be brief in descending upon this part of her career. As I can-
not describe the mysteries of freemasonry, although I have a shrewd idea
that it is a humbug: so an uninitiated man cannot take upon himself to
portray the great world accurately, and had best keep his opinions to
himself whatever they are.
bEcky has often spoken in subsequent years of this season of her life,
when she moved among the very greatest circles of the London fashion.
Her success excited, elated, and then bored her. At first no occupation
was more pleasant than to invent and procure (the latter a work of no
small trouble and ingenuity, by the way, in a person of Mrs. Rawdon
Crawley's very narrow mens)-to procure, we say, the prettiest new
dresses and ornaments; to drive to fine dinner parties, where she was
welcomed by great people; and from the fine dinner parties to fine asset-
lies, whither the same people came with whom she had been dining, whom
she had met the night before, and would see on the morrow-the young
men fnultlessly appointed, handsomely cravatted, with the nearest glossy
boots and white gloves-the elders portly, brass-buttoned, noble-looking,
polite, and prose-the young ladies blonde, timid, and in pink-the
mothers grand, beautiful, sumptuous, solemn, and in diamonds. They
talked in English, not in bad French, as they do in the novels. They
talked about each others' houses, and characters, and families : just as the
Joneses do about the Smiths. Becky's former acquaintances hated and
enviel her: the poor woman herself was yawning in spirit.  I wish I
were out of it,'' she said to herself. I would rather be a person's wife,
and teach a Sunday school than this; or a sergeant's lady and ride in
the regimental wagon; or, OF how much gayer it would be to wear spangles
and trousers, and dance before a booth at a fair,''
 You would do it very well,'' said Lord Steyne, laughing. She used
to tell the great man her ennui and perplexities in her artless way-they
amused him.
'' Rawdon would make a very good Excuse--Master of the Ceremonies-
what do you call him-the man in the large boots and the uniform, who
goes round the ring cracking the whip He is large, heavy, and of a
military figure. I reeollect,'' Becky continued, entirely, ``my father
took me to see a show at Brookgreen Fair when I was a child; and when
we came home I made myself a pair of stilts, and danced in the studio to
the wonder of all the pupils.''
I should have like to see it,'' said Lord Steyne.
I should like to do it now,'' Becky continued. t How Lady Blinkey
would open her eyes, and Lady Gabriel Macbeth would stare Hush

of being conspicuously polite to the professional ladies and gentlemen who
attended at these aristocratic parties-of allowing them into the corners

where they sat in silence, and shaking hands with them, and smiling in
the view of all persons. She was an artist herself, as she and very
truly: there was a frankness and humility in the manner in which she
acknowledged her origin, which provoked, or disarmed, or amused
cookers-on, as the case might be. How cool that woman is,'' said one;
``what airs of independence she assumes, where she ought to sit still and
be thankful if anybody speaks to her.''  What an honest and good-
natured soul she is,'' said another. e What an artful little minx,'' said a
third. They were all right very likely; but Becky went her own way,
and so fascinated the professional personages, that they would leave off
their sore throats in order to sing at her parties, and give her lessons for
nothing.
Yes, she gave parties in the little house in Curzon Street. Many scores
of carriages, with blazing lamps, blocked up the street, to the disgust of
No. 100, who could not rest for the thunder of the knocking, and on 102,
who could not sleep for envy. The gigantic footmen who accompanied
the vehicles, were too big to be contained in Becky's little hall, and were
billeted off in the neighbouring public-houses, whence, when they were
wanted, cll-boys summoned them from their beer. sOme of the great
ladies of London squeezed and trod on each other on the little stairs,
laughing to find themselves there; and many spotless and severe ladies of
ton were seated in the little drawing-room, listening to the professional
singers, who were singing according to their wont, and as if they wished
to blow the windows down., And the day after, there appeared among
the fashionable reunions in the  Morning Post,'' a paragraph to the
following effect:-
Yesterday, Colonel and Mrs. Crawley entertained a select party at dinner
at their house in May Fair. heir Excellencics the prince and princess
of Peterwaralin, H. E. Papoosh Pasha, the turkish Ambassador (attended
by Kibob aBbey, dragoman of the mission), the Marquess of Steyne, Earl of
Touchdown, Mr. Pitt and Lady Jane Crawley, Mr. Wage, &c. After
dinner Mrs. Crawley had an assembly which was attended by the dUchess
(Dowager) of Stilton, Duc de la Gruyere, Marchioness of Cheshire, Mar-
these Alessandro Strachan, Comte de Brie, Baron Schapzuger, Chevalier
Tosti, Countess of lIvingstone, anl INdy F. Macadam, Major-General and
Italy G. Mnebcth, and (2) Miss Macbeth; Viscount addington, Sir

And in her commerce with the great our lens friend showed the same
fraukness which distinguished her transactions with the lowly in station.
Ou one occasion, when out at a very fine house, Referee was (perhaps
rather ostentatiously) holding a conversation in the french language with
a celebrated tenor singer of that nation, while the Lady Gabriel Macbeth
looked over her shoulder scowling at the pair.
How very well you speak French,'' INdy Gabriel said, who herself
spoke the tongue in a Edinburgh accent most remarkable to hear.
I ought to know it,'' Becky modestly said, casting down her eyes.

vAIFY AIR.
Lady Gabriel was won by her humility, and was mollified towards the
little woman. She deplored the fatal levelling tendencies of the age, which
admitted persons of all classes into the society of their superiors: but her
ladyship owned, that this one at least was well behaved and never forgot
her place in life. She was a very good woman: good to the poor: stupid,
blameless, suspicious.-It is not her ladyship's fault that she fancies
herself better than you and me. he skirts of her ancestors' garments
have been kissed for centuries: it is a thousand years, they say, since the
tartans of the head of the family were embraced by the defunct Duncan's
lords, nand councillors, when the great ancestor of the house became king
of Scotland.
Lady Steyne, after the music scene, succumbed before Becky, and perhaps
was nut disinclined to her. The younger ladies of the house of Gaunt were
also compelled into submission. Once or twice they set people at her, but
they failed. The brilliant Lady Stunnington tried a passage of arms with her,
but was routed with great slaughter by the intrepid little Becky. When
attacked sometimes, wEekly had a knack of adopting a demure ingeiue air,
nder which she was most dangerous. She said the wickedest things with
the most simple unaflecetel air when in this mood, and would take care
aimlessly to apologise for her blunders, so that all the world should know
that she had made them.
M. WIng, the celebrated wit, and a led captain and trenches-man of
my Lord tyne, was caused by the ladies to charge her; and the worthy
fellow, leering at his pantronesses, and giving them a wick, as much as to
say, ` Now look out for sport,''-one evening began an assault upon
Becky, who was unsuspicuously eating her dinner. The little women,
attacked on a sudden, but never without arms, lighted up in an
instant, parried and reposted with a home-thrust, which made Wang's
face tingle with shame; then she returned to her soup with the most
perfect calm and a quiet smile on her face. King's great patron, who
gave him dinners and lent him n little money sometimes, and whose elec-
tion, newspaper, and other jobs Wage did, gave the reckless fellow such
a savage glance with the eyes as almost made him sink under the table
and burst into tears. He looked piteously at my lord, who never spoke
to him during dinner, and at the ladies, who disowned him. At last
Becky herself took compassion upon him, and tried to engage him in
talk. He was not asked to dinner again for six weeks ; and Niche, my
lord's confidential man, to whom Wage naturally paid a good deal of
court, was instructed to tell him that if he ever dared to say a rude thing
to Mrs. Crawley again, or make her the butt of his stupid jokes, Minor
would put every one of his notes of hand into his lawyer's hands, and
sell him up without mercy. Wage wept before Niche, and implored
his denr friend to intercede for him. He wrote a poem in favour of
Mr. R. C., which appeared in the very next number of the ``Harumscarum
Magazine,'' which he conducted. lle implored her good will at parties
where he met her. He cringed and conxed Rawdon at thereby. He was
allowed to come back to Gaunt louse after a while. Becky was always

ment anat the dinner table), Mr. Denham, was much more prudent in his
behaviour and opinions than Mr. When. HOwever much he might be
disposed to hate all revenues (Mr. Denham himself was a staunch old
True Blue Tory, and his father a small coal-merchant in the north of
England), this aide-de-camp of the Marquis never showed any sort of
hostility to the new favourite; but pursued her with stealthy kindness,
and a sly and deferential politeness, which somehow made Becky more
uneasy the other people's overt hostilities.
llIow the Crawleys got the money which was spent upon the entertain-
cents with which they treated the polite world, was a mystery which gave
rise to some conversation at the time, and probably added zest to these
little festivities. Some persons averred that sIr Pitt Crawley gave his
brother a handsome allowance: if he did, Becky's power over the
baronet must have been extraordinary indeed, and his character greatly
changed in his advanced age. Other parties hinted that it was Becky's
habit to levy contributions on all her husband's friends: going to this one
in tents with an account that there was an execution in the house; falling
on her knees to that one, and declaring that the whole family must go
to gaol or commit suicide unless such and such a bill could be paid. Lord
Touchdown, it was said, had been induced to give many hundreds through
these pathetic representations. oung Health, of the-th Dragoons (and
son of the firm of liver and Chatham, matters and army accoutrement
makers), and whom the Crawleys introduced into fashionable life, was
also cited as one of Becky's victims in the pecunianry way. People declared
that she got money from various simply disposed persons, under preteee
of getting them confidential appointments under government. Who knows
what stories were or were not told of our dear and innocent friend 
Certain it is, that if she had had all the money which she was said to
have begged or borrowed or stolen, she might have capitalised and been
honest for life, whereas,-but this is advancing matters.
The truth is, that by economy and good management-by a sparing use
of ready money and by paying scarcely anybody,-people can manage, for
a time at least, to make a great show with very little means: and it is our
holief that Becky's much-talked-of parties, which were not, after all was
said, very numerous, cost this lady very little more than the wax candles
which lighted the walls. Stillbrook and Queen's Crawley supplied her
with game and fruit in abundance. Lord Steyne's cellars were at her
disposal, and that excellent nobleman's famous cooks presided over her
little kitchen, or scnt by my lord's order the rarest delicacies from their own.
I protest it is quite shameful in the world to abuse a simple creature, as
people of her time abuse Becky, and I warn the public against believing
one-tenth of the stories against her. If every person is to be banished
from society who runs into debt and cannot pay-if we are to be peering
into everybody's private life, speculating upon their income, and cutting
them if we don't approve of their expenditure-why, what a howling
wilderness and intolerable dwelling Vanity fAir would be. Every man's
hand would be against his neighbour in this case, my dear tSar, and the
benefits of civilisation would be done away with. We should be quarrelling,
abusing, avoiding one another. Our houses would become caverns: and
456
VANITY FAIR.
we should go in rags because we cared for nobody. Rents would go down.
Parties wouldn't be given any more. All the tradesmen of the town would
be bankrupt. Wine, wax-lights, convertible, rouge, caroline-petticoats,
diamonds, wigs, Louis-equator-gimcracks, and old china, park hacks and
splendidhigh-stepping carriage horses-all the delights life, I say,-would
go to the deuce, if people did but act upon their silly principles, and aid
those whom they dislike and abuse. Whereas, by a little charity and
mutual forbearance, things are made to go on pleasantly enough: we may
abuse a man as much as we like, and call him the greatest rascal unhung--
but do we wish to hang him therefore? No. We shake hands when we
meet. If his cook is good we forgive him, and go and dine with him;
and we expect he will do the same by us. Thus true flourishes-civil-
nation advances: peace is kept; new dresses are wanted for new asset-
lies every week; and the last year's vintage of Lafitte will remunerate
the honest proprietor who reared it.
At the time whereof we are writing, though the Great George was on
the throne and ladies wore gigots and large combs like tortoise-shell
shovels in their hair, instead of the simple sleeves and lovely wreaths
which are actually in fashion, the manners of the very polite world were
not, I take it, essentially different from those of the present day: and
their amusements pretty similar. To us, from outside gazing over the
policemen's shoulders at the bewildering beautics as they pass into Court
or ball, they may seem beings of unenrthly splendour, and in the enjoy-
ment of an exquisite happiness by us unattainable. It is to console some
of these dissatisfied beings, that we are narrating our dear Becky's struggles,
and triumphs, and disappointments, of all of which, indeed, as is the case
with all persons of merit, she had her share.
At this time the amiable amusement of acting charades had come
among us from France: and were considerably in vogue in this country,
enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their
charms, and the fewer number who had cleverness, to exhibit their wit.
My Lord Steyne was incited by Becky, who perhaps believed herself
endowed with both the above qualifications, to give an entertainment nat
Gaunt House, which should include some of these little dramas-and we
must take leave to introduce the reader to this brilliant reunion, and, with
a melancholy welcome too, for it will be among the very last of the
fashionable entertainments to which it will be our fortune to conduct him.
A portion of that splendid room, the picture-gallery of Gaunt HOuse,
was arranged as the charade theatre. It had been so used when
George III, was king; and a picture of the Marquis of Gaunt is still
extant, with his hair in power and a pink ribbon, in a woman shape, as it
was called, enacting the part of Nato in Mr. Alison's tragedy of that
name, performed before their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales, the
Bishop of Osnaburg, and Prince William leury, then children like the
actor. One or two of the old properties were drawn out of the turrets,
where they had lain ever since, and furnished up new for the present
festivities.
Young Edwin Sands, then an elegant dandy anl Eastern traveller, was
manager of the revels. An Eastern traveller was somebody in those days,
A NOVEL wITHOUT A HER0,
457
and the adventurous Edwin, who had published his quarto, and passed
some months under the tents in the desert, was a personage of no small
importance.-In his volume there were several pictures of Sands in
various oriental costumes; and he travelled about with a black attendant
of most unprepossessing appearance, just like another BRian de Bois Guilt-
bert. Edwin, his costumes, and black man, were hailed at Guant House'
as very valuable acquisitions.
He led off the first charade. A Turkish officer with an immense plume
of feathers (the Janissaries were supposed to be still in existence, and the
taboos had not as yet displaced the ancient and majestic heal-dress of
the true believers) was seen couched on a divan, and making believe to
puff at a narghile, in which, however, for the sake of the ladies, only a
fragrant bastille was allowed to smoke. The Turkish diguitary yawns
and expresses signs of weariness and idleness. He claps his hands and
Measure the Nubian appears, with bare arms, baugles, yataghans, and
every eastern ornament-gaunt, tall, and hideous. He makes a salaam
before my lord the gu.
A thrill of terror and delight runs through the assembly. The ladies
whisper to one another. The lack slave was given to Sands Edwin by
an egyptian pasha in exchange for three dozen of Maraschino. He has
shown up ever so many odalisques in sacks and tilted them into the Nile.
Bid the slave-merchant enter,'' says the Turkish voluntary, with a
wave of his hand. Measure conducts the slave-merchant into my lord'
presence: he brings a veiled female with him. 1Ie removes her veil.
A thrill of applause bursts through the house. It is Mra, Wentworth (she
was a Miss Absolom) with the beautiful eyes and hair. She is in a
gorgeous oriental costume; the black braided locks are twined with
innumerable jewels; her dress is covered over with gold pictures. Tha
onions Homestand expresses himself charmed by her beauty. She falls
down on her knees, and cntreats him to restore her to the mountains
where she was born, and where her Circassian lover is still deploying the
absence of his Zuleikah. No entreaties will move the obdurate Hassan.
He laughs at the notion of the Circssian bridegroom. Znuleikah covers
her face with her hands, and drops down in an attitude of the most
beautiful despair. There seems To be no hope for her, when-when the
Keslar Aga appears.
The Keslar Aga brings a letter from the Sultan. Hassan receives and
places on his head the dread firman. A ghastly terror seizes him, while
on the negro's face (it is Measure again in another costume) appears a
ghastly joy. `Mercy1 mercy1'' cries the Pasha; while the keslar Aga,
grinning horribly, pulls out-a of-string.
The curtain draws just as he is going to use that awful weapon.
Hassan from within bawls out, ` first two syllables ''-and Mrs. Rawlon
Crawley, who is going to act in the charade, comes forward and ceo-
elements Mrs. Wentworth on the admirable taste and beauty of her
costume.
The second part of the charade takes place. It is still an eastern
scene. Hassan, in another dress, is in an attitude by Zuleikah, who is
perfectly reconciled to him. The Keslar Aga has become a peaceful black

band facetiously plays the ` The Camels are coming.''  An enormous
Egyptian head figures in the scene. It is a musical one,-and, to the
surprise of the oriental travellers, sings a comic song, composed by Mr.
Wage. The eastern voyagers go off dealing, like Papageno and the
Moorish Ying, in the Magic Flute. `'Last two syllables'' roars the head.
The last act opens. It is a Grecian tent this time. A tall and stal-
wart man reposes on a couch there. Above him hang his helmet and
shield. There is no need for them now. Ilium is down. Iphigenia is

the innocence of theatrical youth-she makes a curtsey. Mama says
Why, child, you are always laughing and singing,'' and away she goes,

TIME ROSE UPON MY BALCONY.
Tha rose upon my balcony the morning air performing,
Was leafless all the winter time and pining for the spring;
You ask me why her breath is sweet and why ler cheek is blooming
It is because the sun is out and birds begin to sing.
The nightingale, whose melody is through the greenwood ringing,
Was aleut when the boughs were bare and winds were blowing keen:
And if, Miamma, you ask of mo the reason of his singing;
It is because the sun is out and all the leaves are green.
Thus each performed his part, MInimum, the birds have found their voices,
The blowing rose a flush, Mama, her honey cheek to die;
And there's sunshine in my heart, Mammon, which woken and rootless,
And so i sing and blush, Mama, and that's the reason why.
During the intervals of the stanzas of this ditty, the good-natured
personage addressed as mamma by the singer, and whose large whiskers
appeared under her cap, seemed very anxious to exhibit her maternal
affection by embracing the innocent creature who performed the daughter'a
part. Every cares was received with loud acclamation of laughter by
the sympathising audience. At its conclusion (while the music was
performing a symphony as if ever so many birds were warbling) the whole
house was unanimous for an encore: and applause and bouquets without
end were showered upon the NIGHTINGALE of the evening. Lord Steyne's
voice of applause was loudest of all. BEcky, the nightingale, took the
flowers which he threw to her, and pressed them to her heart with the air
of a consummate comedian. Lord tyne was frantic with delight. His
guests' enthusiasm harmonised with his own. Where was the beautiful
black-eyed Hours whose appearance in the first charnde had caused
such delight. She was twice as handsome as Becky, but the brilliancy of
the latter had quite eclipsed her. All voices were for her. Stephens,
Labrador, Renzi de BEgins, people compared her to one or the other, and
agreed with good reason, very likely, that had she been an actress none
on the stage could have surpassed her. She had reached her culmination :
her voice rose drilling and bright over the storm of applause: and soared
as high and joyful ns her triumph. There was a ball after the dramatic
entertainments, and everybody pressed round Becky as the great point of
attraction of the evening. The Royal Personage declared with an month,
that she was perfection, and engaged her again and again in conversation.
Little Becky's soul swelled with pride and delight at these honours; she
saw fortune, fame, fashion before her. Lord Stcyne was her slave;
followed her everywhere, and scarcely spoke to any one in the room
beside; and paid her the most marked clients and attention.
She still appeared in her Marquise costume, and danced a minuet with

the Duke, who had all the traditions of the ancient court, pronounced that
Madame Crawley was worthy to have been a pupil of Vestris, or to have
figured at Versailles. Only a feeling of dignity, the out, and the strongest
sense of duty and personal sacrifice, prevented his Excellency from dancing
with her himself; and he declared in public, that a lady who could talk and
dance like Mrs. Rawdon, was fit to be ambassadors at any court in Europe.
He was only consoled when he heard that she was half a Frenchwoman by
birth.  None but a compatriot,'' his Excellency declared, ``could have
performed that majestic dance in such a way.''
Then she figured in a waltz with Monsieur de Klingenspohr, the Prince
of Peterwaradin's cousin aud attache. The delighted Prince, having less
revenue than his French diplomatic colleague, insisted upon taking a turn
with the charming creature, and twirled round the ball-room with her,
scattering the diamond out of his boot-tassels and hussar jacket until his
highness was fairly out of breath. Papoosh Pasha himself would have
liked to dance with her if that amusement had been the custom of his
country. The company made a circle round her, and applauded as will
as if she had been a Noble or u Taglioni. Everybody was in ecstasy;
and Becky too, you may be sure. She passed by Lady Stunington with
a look of scorn. She patronised Lady Gaunt and her astonished and
mortified sister-in-law-she crasei all rival charmers. As for poor Mrs,
Wentworth, and her long hair and great eyes, which had made such an
effect at the commencement of the evening; where was she now No-
where in the race. She might ten her long hair and cry her great eyes
out ; but there was not a person to heed or to deplore the discomfiture.
The greatest triumph of all was at supper time. She was placed at the
grand exclusive table with his Royal Highness the exalted personage before
mentioned, and the rest of the great guests. She was served on gold plate.
She might have had pearls melted into her champagne if she liked-another
Cleopatra; and the potentate of Peterwaradin would have given half the
brilliant off his jacket for a kind glance from those dazzling eyes. Abortive
wrote home about her to his government. The ladies at the other tables,
who supped off mere silver, and marked Lord Steyne's constant attention
to her, vowed it was a monstrous infatuation, a gross insult to ladies of
rank. If sarcasm could have killed, Lady Stunnington would have skin
her on the spot.
Rawdon Crawley was scared at these triumphs. They seemed to sep-
rate his wife farther than ever from him somehow. He thought with
feeling very like pain how immeasurably she was his superior.
When the hour of departure came, a crowd of young men followed her
to her carriage, for which the people without bowled, the cry being caught
up by the link-men who were stationed outside the tall gates of Gaunt
House, congratulating each person who issued from the gate and hoping
his Lordship had enjoyed this noble party.
MIrs. Rawdon Crawley's carriage, coming up to the gate after due shout-
ing, rattled into the illuminated court-yard, and drove up to the covered
way. Rawdon put his wife into the carriage, which drove off. Mr. Wen-
ham had proposed to him to walk home, and offered the Colonel ths
refreshment of a cigar.

the Crawley family did
the greatest honour to
his benevolent discrimi-
nation. His lordship
extended his good-will
to little Rawdon: he
pointed out to the boy's
parents the necessity of
sending him to a public
school; that he was of
an age now when emula-
tion, the first principles
of the Latin language,
pugilistic exercises, and
the society of his fellow-
boys would be of the greatest benefit to the boy. His father objected that
he was not rich enough to send the child to a good public school; his
mother, that Briggs was a capital mistress for him, and had brought him
on (as indeed was the fact) famously in English, the Latin rudiments, and in
general learning: but all these objections disappeared before the generous
perseverance of the Marquis of Steyne. His lordship was one of the
governors of that famous old collegiate institution called the Whitefriars.
It had been a Cistercian Convent in old days, when the Smithfield, which
is contiguous to it, was a tournament ground. Obstinute heretics used to
be brought thither convenient for burning hard by. Harry VIII., the
Defender of the Fifth, seized upon the monastery and its possessions, and
hanged and tortured some of the monks who could not accommodate them-
selves to the pace of his reform. Finally, a great merchant bought the house
and land adjoining, in which, and with the help of other wealthy endow-
ments of land and money, he established a famous foundation hospital for old
men and children. An extern school grew round the old almost mo-
nastic foundation, which subsists still with its middle-age costume and
usages: and nll Cistcrcians pray that it may long flourish.
Of this famous house, some of the greatest noblemen, prelates, and

dignitaries in England are governors: and as the boys are very comfortably
lodged, fed, and educated, and subsequently inducted to good scholar-
ships at the University and living in the Church, many little gentlemen
are devoted to the ecclesiastical profession from their tenderness years, and
there is considerable emulation to procure nominations for the found-
tions. It was originally intended for the sons of poor and deserving
clerics and laics; but many of the noble governors of the Institution,
with an enlarged and rather capricious benevolence, selected all sorts of
objects for their bounty. To get an education for nothing, and a future
livelihood and profession assured, was so excellent a scheme, that some
of the richest people did not disdain it; and not only great men's
relations, but great men themselves, sent their sons to profit by the
chance-Right Rev. Prelates sent their own kinsmen or the sons of their
clergy, while, on the other hand, some great noblemen did not disdain
to patronise the children of their confidential servants,-so that a lad
entering this establishment had every variety of youthful society wherewith
to mingle.
Rawdon Crawley, though the only book which he studied was the
Racing Calendar, and though his chief recollections of polite learning
were connected with the flogging which he received at eLton in his early
youth, had that decent and honest reverence for classical learning which all
English gentlemen feel, and was glad to think that his son was to have a
provision for life, perhaps, and a certain opportunity of becoming a
scholar. And although his boy was his chief solace and companion,
and endeared to him by n thousand small tics, about which he did
not care to speak to his wife, who had all along shown the utmost india-
ference to their son, yet Rawdon agreed at one to part with him, and to
give up his own greatest comfort and benefit for the sake of the welfare of
the little lad. He did not know how fond he was of the child until it
became necessary to let him go away. When he was gone, he felt more
sad and downcast than he cared to own-far sadder than the boy himself,
who was happy enough to enter a new career, and find companions of his
own age. Becky burst out laughing once or twice, when the Colonel, in
his clumsy, incoherent way, tried to express his sentimental sorrows at the
boy's departure. The poor fellow felt that his dearest pleasure and closest
friend was taken from him. He looked often and wistfully at the little
vacant bed in his dressing-room, where the child used to sleep. He
missed him sadly of mornings, and tried in vain to walk in the Park
without him. He did not know how solitary he was until little Rawdon
was gone. He liked the people who were fond of him; and would go
and sit for long hours with his good-natured sister Lady Jane, and talk to
her about the virtues, and good looks, and hundred good qualities of the
child.
Young Rawdon's aunt, we have said, was very fond of him, as was her
little girl, who wept obviously when the time for her cousin's departure
came. The elder Rawdon was thankful for the fondness of mother and
daughter. The very best and honestest feelings of the man came out in
these artless outpouring of paternal feeling in which he indulged in their
presence, and encouraged by their sympathy. He secured not only

Lady Jane's kindness, but her sincere regard, by the feelings which he
manifested, and which he could not show to his own wife. The two
kinswomen met as seldom as possible. Becky laughed bitterly at Jane's
feelings and softness; the other's kindly and gentle nature could not but
revolt at her sister's callous behaviour.
It estranged Rawdon from his wife more than he knew or acknowledged
to himself. She did not care for the estrangement. Indeed, she did not
miss him or anybody. She looked upon him as her errand-man and
humble slave. He might be ever so depressed or sulky, and she did not
mark his demeanour, or only treated it with a sneer. She was busy
thinking about her position or her pleasures or her advancement in society;
she ought to have held a great place in it, that is certain.
It was honest Briggs who made up the little it for the boy which he
was to take to school. Molly, the housemaid, blubber in the passage
when he went away-Molly kind and faithful in spite of a long career of
unpaid wages. Mrs. Becky could not let her husband have the carriage
to take the boy to school. Take the horses into the City !-such a thing
was never heard of. Let a can be brought. She did not offer to kiss
him when he went: nor did the child propose to embrace her: but gave
a kiss to old Briggs, (whom, in general, he was very shy of caressing), and
console her by pointing out that he was to come home on Saturday,
when she would have the benefit of seeing him. As the cab rolled towards
the City, Becky's carriage rattled off to the Park. She was chattering
and laughing with a score of young dandies by the Serpentine, as the
father and son entered at the old gates of the school-where Rawdon left
the child, and came away with a sadder purer feeling in his heart than
perhaps that poor battered fellow had ever known since he himself came
out of the nursery.
He walked all the way home very dismally, and died alone with Briggs.
e was very kind to her, and grateful for her love and watchfulness over
the boy. His conscience smote him that he had borrowed Briggs's money
and aided in deceiving her. They talked about little Rawdon a long time,
for Becky only came home to dress and go out to dinner-And then he
went off uneasily to drink ten with Lady Jane, and tell her of what had
happened, and how little Rawdon went off like a trump, and how he was
to wear a gown and little knee-breaches, and how young Blackball, Jack
BInekball's son, of the old regiment, had taken him in charge and promised
to be kind to him.
In the course of a week, young Blackball had constituted little Rnwdon
his fag, shoe-black, and breakfast monster ; initiated him into the mysteries
of the Latin Grammar, and thrashed him three or four times; but not
severely. The little chap's good-natured honest face on his way for him.
He only got that degree of beating which was, no doubt, good for him;
and as for blaeking shows, toasting bread, and lagging in general, were
these offices not deemed to be necessary parts of every young English
gentleman's education 2

His father graciously tipped Blaekball, his master, a sovereign, and
secured that young gentleman's good will towards his fag. As a protege'
of the great Lord Steyne, the nephew of a County member, and son of a
Colonel and C.B., whose name appeared in some of the most fashionable
parties in the Morning Post, perhaps the school authorities were disposed
not to look unkindly on the child. He had plenty of pocket-money, which
he spent in treating his comrades royally to raspberry tarts, and he was
often allowed to come home on saturday to his father, who always
made a jubilee of that day. When free, Rawdon would take him to the play,
or send him thither with the footman ; and on sUndays he went to church
with Briggs and Lady Jane and his cousins. Rawdon marvelled over his
stories about school, and fights, and lagging. Before long, he knew the
names of all the masters and the principal boys as well as little Rawdon
himself. He invited little Rawdon's crony from school, and made both

tried to look knowing over the Latin grammar when little Rawdon showed

cnn't attend to them yourself. I should like to know where you would
have been now, and in what sort of a position in society, if I had not
looked after you 2'' Indeed, nobody wanted poor old Rawdon at the parties
whither Becky used to go. She was often asked without him now. She
talked about great people as if she had the fee-simple of May Fair; aud
when the Court went into mourning, she always wore black.
Little Rawdon being disposed of, Lord Steyne, who took such a
parental interest in the affairs of this amiable poor family, thought that
their expenses might be very advantageously curtailed by the departure
of Miss Briggs; and that Becky was quite clever enough to take the
management of her own house. It has been narrated in a former Chapter,
how the benevolent nobleman had given his protege money to pay off
her little debt to Miss Briggs, who however still remained behind with
her friends: whence my lord came to the painful conclusion that Mrs.
Crawley hud made some other use of the money confided to her than that
for which her generous patron had given the loan. However, LOrd Steyne
was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to MIrs. Becky,
whose feelings might he hurt by any controversy on the money-question,
and who might have a thousand painful reasons for disposing otherwise of
his lordship's generous loan. But he determined to satisfy himself of the
real state of the case: and instituted the necessary inquiries in a most
cautious and delicate manner.
In the first place he took an early opportunity of pumping Miss Biggs.
That was not a difficult operation. A very little encouragement would
set that worthy woman to talk volubly, and pour out all within her. And
one day when Mrs. Rawdon had gone out to drive (and Mr. Niche, his
lordship's confidential servant, easily learned at the livery stables where the
Crawleys kept their carriage and horses, or rather, where the livery-man
kept n carriage and horses for Mr. and Mrs. Crawley)-my lord dropped
in upon the Curzon Street house-asked Briggs for a cup of coffee-told
her that he had good accounts of the little boy at school-and in five
minutes found out from her that Mrs. Rawdon had given her nothing
except a black silk gown, for which Miss Briggs was immensely grateful.
Ile laughed within himself at this artless story. For the truth is, our
dear friend Rebecca had given him a most circumstantial narration of
Briggs's delight at receiving her money-eleven hundred and twenty-five
pounds-and in what securities she had invested it: and what a pang
Becky herself felt in being obliged to pay any such a delightful sum
of money.  Who knows,'' the dear woman may have thought within
A N0VEL WIIIIOUT A HERO.
469
herself, "`perhaps he may give me a little more'' My lord, however,
made no such proposal to the little schemer-very likely thinking that he
had been sufficiently generous already.
He had the curiosity, then, to ask Miss Briggs about the state of
her private affairs-and she told his lordship candidly what her position
was-how Miss Crawley had left her a legacy-how her relatives had had
part of it-how Colonel Crawley had put out another portion, for which
she had the best security and interest-and how Mr, and Mrs. London
had kindly busied themselves with ir Pitt, who was to dispose of the
remainder most advantageously for her, when he had time. My lord
asked how much the Colonel had already invested for her, and Miss Briggs
at once and truly told him that the sum was six hundred and odd pounds.
But as soon as she had told her story, the voluble Briggs repented of
her frankness, and besought my lord not to tell Mr. Crawley of the con-
sessions which she had made.  The Colonel was so kind-Mr. Crawley
might be offended and pay back the money, for which she could get no
such good interest anywhere else.'' Lord Steyne, laughing, promised he
never would divulge their conversation, and when he and Miss Briggs
cartel he laughed still more.
What an accomplished little neil it is' thought he. wHAt a
splendid actress and manager She and almost got a second supply out
of me the other day, with her coaxing ways. She hunts all the women I
have ever seen in the course of all my well-spent life. They are babies
compared to her. I am a green-horn myself, and a fool in her hands-an
old fool. She is unsurpassable in lies.'' His lordship's admiration for
Becky rose immeasurably at this proof of her cleverness. Getting the
money was nothing-but getting double the sum she wanted, and
paying nobody-it was a magnificent stroke. And Crawley, my lord
thought-Crawley is not such a fool and he looks and seems. he has
managed the matter cleverly enough on his side. Nobody would ever
have supposed from his face and demeanour that he knew anything about
this money business ; and yet he put her in to it, and has spent the money,
no doubt. In this opinion my lord, we know, was mistaken; but it
influenced n good deal his behaviour towards Colonel Crawley, whom he
began to trent with even less than that semblance of respect which he had
formerly shown towards that gentleman. It never entered into the head
of Mrs. Crawley's patron that the little lady might be making a purse for
herself; and, perhaps, if the truth must be told, he judged of Colonel
Crawley by his experience of other husbands, whom he had known in the
course of the long and well-spent life, which had made him acquainted
with a great deal of the weakness of mankind. My lord hal bought so
many men during his life, that he was surely to be pardoned for supposing
that he had found the price of this one.
He taxed Becky upon the point on the very first occasion when he met
her alone, and he completed her, good-humoured, on her eleverness
iu getting more than the money which she required. BEcky was only
a little taken aback. It was not the habit of this denr creature to tell
falschoods, except when necessity compelled, but in these great emerged-
lies it was her practice to lie very freely; and in an instant she was ready
470
VANITY AIB.
with another neat plausible circumstantial story which she administered
to her patron. The previous statement which she had made to him was a
falsehood-a wicked falsehood : she owned it ; but who had made her tell it?
 Ah, my Lord,'' she said, `'you don't know all I have to suffer and bear in
silence: you see me gay and happy before you-you little know what I have
to endure when there is no protector near me. It was my husband, by
threats and the most stage treatment, forced me to ask for that sum
about which I deceived you. It was he, who, foreseeing that questions
might be asked regarding the disposal of the money, forced me to account
for it as I did. He took the money. He told me he had paid Miss
Briggs; I did not want, Did not dare to doubt him. Pardon the wrong
which a desperate man is forced to commit, and pity a miserable, miserable
woman.'' She burst into tears as she spoke. Persecuted virtue neer
looked more bewitchingly wretched.
They had a long conversation, driving round and round the Regent's
Park in Mrs. Crawley's carriage together, a conversation of which it is
not necessary to repeat the details: but the upshot of it was, that, when
Becky came home, she flew to her dear Briggs with a smiling face, and
announced that she had some very good news for her. Lord Steyne had
acted in thenoblest und most generous manner. He was always thinking
how and when he could do good. Now that little Rawdon was gone to
sell, a dear companion and friend was no longer necessary to her. She
was grieved beyond measure to part with Briggs; but her means required
that she should practise every retrenchment, and her sorrow was mitigated
by the idea that her dear Briggs would be far better provided for by her
generous patron than in her humble home. Mrs. Pilkington, the house-
keeper at Greatly Hall, was growing exceedingly old, feeble, and rhea-
matic: she was not equal to the work of superintendent that vast mansion,
and must be on the look out for a successor. It was a splendid position.
The family did not go to Greatly once in two years. At other times the
housekeeper was the mistress of the magnificent mansion-had four covers
daily for her table; was visited by the clergy and the most respectable
people of the county-was the lady of Greatly, in fact; and the two last
housekeepers before Mrs. Pilkington had married sectors of Greatly: but
Mrs. P. could not, being the aunt of the present lector. The place was
not to be here yet; but she might go down on a visit to Mrs. Pilkington,
and see whether she would like to succeed her.
What words can paint the tactics gratitude of Briggs All she tipu-
late for was that little Rawdon should be allowed to come down and see
her at the lIall. Becky praised this-any thing. She ran up to her
husband when he came home, and told him the joyful news. Rawdon
was glad, deduced glad; the weight was off his conscience about poor
Briggs's money. She was provided for, at any rate, but-but his mind
was disquiet. 1He did not seem to be all right somehow. Ie told little
Touchdown what Lord Steyne had done, and the young man eyed Crawley
with an air which surprised the latter,

both said.  YOu must go with her, Rawdon, wherever she goes, and you
just have somebody with her-one of the girls from queen's Crawley,
perhaps, though they were rather giddy guardians for her,''
Somebody Becky should have. But in the meanwhile it was clear that
honest Briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life; and so she
and her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey. And so two
of Rawdon's out-sentinels were in the hands of the enemy.
Sir Pitt went and expostulated with his sister-in-law upon the subject
of the dismissal of bRiggs, and other matters of delicate family interest.
In vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the protection of Lord
Steyne for her poor husband; how cruel it would be on their part to
deprive Briggs of the position offered to her. Complements, coatings,
smiles, tears could not satisfy ir Pitt, and he had something very like a
quarrel with his once admired Becky. He spoke of the honour of the
family : the unsullied reputation of the Crawleys; expressed himself in
indignant tones about er receiving those young Frenchmen-those wild
young men of fashion, my Lord Steyne himself, whose carriage was always
at her door, who passed hours daily in her company, and whose constant
presence made the world talk about her. As the head of the house he is-
plowed her to be more prudent. Society was already speaking lightly of her.
Lord Steyne, though a nobleman of the greatest station and talents, was a
man whose attentions would compromise any woman; he besought, he
implored, he commanded his sister-in-law to be watchful in her intercourse
with that nobleman.
Becky promised anything and everything Pitt wanted ; but Lord Steyne
came to her house as often as ever, and Bir Pitt's anger increased. I
wonder was Lady Jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found
fault with his favourite lebeccnf Lord Steyne's visits continuing, his
own ceased; and his wife was for refusing all further intercourse with that
nobleman, and declining the invitation to the Charade-night which the
Marchioness sent to her; but Sir Pitt thought it was necessary to accept
it, as his Royal Highness would be there.
Although he went to the party in question, Sir Pitt quieted it very
early, and his wife, too, was very glad to come away. lucky hardly so
much as spoke to him or noticed her sister-in-law. Pitt Crawley declared
her behaviour was monstrously indecorous, reprobated in strong terms the
habit of play-acting and fancy dressing, as highly unbecoming a 3british
female; and after the charades were over, took his brother Rawdon
severely to task for appearing himself, and allowing his wife to join in
such improper exhibitions.
Rawdon said she should not join in any more such amusements, but
indeed, and perhaps from hints From his elder brother and sister, he
had already become a very watchful and exemplary domestic character,
He left of his clubs and billiards. He never left home. He took Becky
out to drive: he went laboriously with her to all her parties. Whenever my
Lord Steyne called, he was sure to find the Colonel. And when Becky
proposed to go out without her husband, or received invitations for her-
self, he perenptorily ordered her to refuse them; and there was that in
the gentleman's manner which enforced obedience. Little Becky, to do
472

her justice, was charged with Rawdon's gallantry. If he was surly,
she never was. Whether friends were present or absent, she had always
a kind smile for him, and was attentive to his pleasure and comfort. It
was the early days of their marriage her again: the same good humour,
pregnancies, merriment, and artless confidence and regard.  How much
unpleasant, it is,'' she would say, ``to have you by my side in the carriage
than that foolish old Briggs Let us always go on so, dear Rawdon.
How nice it would be, and how happy we should always be, if we had
but the money'' He fell asleep after dinner in his chair; he did not see
the face opposite to him, haggard, weary, and terrible; it lighted up with
fresh candid smiles when he woke. It kissed him gaily. He wondered
that he had ever had suspicions. No, he never had suspicion; all those
dumb doubts and surly misgivings which had been gathering on his mind
were mere idle jealousies. She was fond of him; she always had been.
As for her shining in society it was no fault of here; she was formed to
shine there. Was there any woman who could talk, or sing, or do
anything like her If she would but like the boys lawson thought.
But the mother and son never could be brought together.
And it was while Rawdon's mind was agitated with these doubts and per-
plexities that the incident occurred which was mentioned in the last
Chapter; and the unfortunate Colonel found himself a prisoner away from
home.

let the party into
the house, and Rawdon was welcomed to the ground-floor apartments
by Mr. Moss, his travelling companion and host, who cheerfully asked him
if he would like a glass of something warm after his drive.
The Colonel was not so depressed as some mortals would be, who,
quitting a palace and a places xor, find themselves barred into a
spunging-house, for, if the truth must be told, he had been a lodger at
Mr. Moss's establishment once or twice before. We have not thought it
necessary in the previous course of this narrative to mention these trivial
little domestic incidents : but the dealer may be assured that they can't
infrequently occur in the life of a man who lives on nothing a-year.
Upon his first visit to Mr. Moss, the Colonel, then a bachelor, had
been liberated by the generosity of his Aunt; on the second mishap, little
Becky, with the greatest spirit and kindness, had borrowed n sum of
money from Lord Touchdown, and had coaxed her husband's creditor
(who was her hawl, velvet-gown, osce pocket-handkerchief, trinket, and
him-crack purveyor, indeed) to take a portion of the sum claimed, and
Rawdon's promissory note for the remainder: so on both these occasions
the capture and release had been conducted with the utmost gallantry on
all sides, and Moss and the Colonel were therefore on the very best of
terms,

gentleman sail, ``as I may honestly say. or may be pretty sure its key

MAr took him out, after a fortnight, jest to punish him, she said. But,
Law bless you, I promise you, he punished my champagne, and had a party

Eul-Casting Ragg, the Honorable Decrease, who lives in the Temple,
and some fellers ns knows a good glass of wine, I warrant you. I've got
a Doctor of Divinity up stairs, fie gents in the Coffee-room, and
MIrs. Moss has a table-dy-hot at half-past five, and a little cards or
music afterwards, when we shall be most happy to see you.''
I'I1 ring, when I want anything,'' said Rawdon, and went quietly to
his bel-room. lle was an old soldier, we have said, and not to be his-
turned by any little shocks of fate. A weaker man would have sent off
a letter to his wife on the instant of his capture. t` But what is the use
of disturbing her night's rest ?'' thought Rawdon. `` She won't know
whether I am in my room or not. It will be time enough to write to her
when she has had her sleep out, and I have had mine. It's only
hundred-and-seventy, and the deuce is in it if we can't raise that,''
And so, thinking about little Rawdon (whom he would not like to
know that he was in such a queer place), the Colonel turned into the
bcd lately occupied by Captain Amish, and fell asleep. It was
ten o'clock when he woke up, and the ruddy-headed youth brought
him, with conscious pride, a fine silver dressing-case, wherewith he might
perform the operation of shaving. Indeed Mr. Moss's use, though
somewhat dirty, was splendid throughout. There were dirty trays, and
wine-coolers en permanence on the side-board, huge dirty gilt cornices,
with dingy yellow satin hangings to the barred windows which looked
into Cursitor Street-stands dirty gilt picture-frames surrounding pieces
sporting and sacred, all of which works were by the greatest masters; and
fetches the greatest prices, to, in the bill transactions, in the course of
which they were sold and bought over and over again. The Colonel'e
breakfast was served to him in the same dingy and gorgeous plated ware.
Miss Moss, a dark-eyed maid in curl papers, appeared with the teapot,
and, smiling, asked the Colonel how he had step and she brought him in
the Morning Post, with the names of all the great people who had figured
at LOrd Steyne's entertainment the night before. It contained a brilliant
account of the festivities, and of the beautiful and accomplished Mrs.
Rawdon Crawley's admirable personifications.
After a lively chat with this lady (who sat on the edge of the break-
fast table in an easy attitude displaying the drapery of her stocking an an
ex-white satin shoe, which was down at heel), Colonel Crawley called for
pens and in, and paper; and being asked how many sheets, chose one
which was brought to him between Miss Moss's own finger and thumb.
MAny a sheet had that dark-eyed damsel brought in; many a poor fellow
had scrawled and blotted hurried lines of entreaty, and paced up and
down that awful room until his messenger brought back the reply. Poor
men always use messengers instead of the post. Who has not had their

letters, with the wafers wet, and the announcement that a person is waiting
in the hall:
Now on the score of his application, awdon had not many misgivings.

frightened if I don 't bring you in your copy. Last night as I was coming
home smoking, I met with an accident. I was able by Most of

here are not very clean, and there may be other things out against me-
I 'm glad it an 't Rawdon's Saturday for coming home. God bless you.
Yours in haste,
 P,S. Make haste and come.''
R. C.
This letter, sealed with a water, was dispatched by one of the messengers
who are always hanging about Mr. Moss's establishment; and lawton,
having seen him depart, went out in the court-yard, and smoked his cigar
with a tolerably easy nind-in spite of the bus over head; fur Mr. Moss's
court-yard is raised in like a cage, lest the gentlemen who are boarding
with him should take a fancy to escape from his hospitality.
Three hours, he calculated, would be the utmost time required, before
Becky should arrive and open his prison doors: and he passed these pretty
cheerfully in smoking, in reading the paper, and in the Coffee-room with
an acquaintance, Captain Walker, who happened to be there, and with
whom he cut for sixpence for some hours, with pretty equal luck on
either side.
But the day passed away and no messenger returned,-no BEcky.
Mr. Moss's table-de-hot was served at the appointed hour of hall-past five,
when such of the gentlemen lodging in the house as could afford to pay
for the banquet, came and partook of it in the splendid front parlour
before described, and with which Mr. Crowley's temporary logging cm-
indicated, when Mile M., (Miss Him, as her papa called her,) apparel
without the curl-papers of the morning, and Are, He did the honours
of a prime boiled leg of mutton and turnips, of which the Colonel ate
with a very faint appetite. Asked whether he would ``stand'' n bottle of
champagne for the company, he consented, anl thc ladies drank to his
'health, and Mr, Moss, in the most polite manner ``looked towards
him.''
In the midst of this request however, the door-bell was heard,-young

Moses of the ruddy hair, rose up with the keys and answered the summons,
and coming back, told the Colonel that the messenger had returned with
a bag, a desk and a letter, which he gave him. `` No ceramony, Colonel,
1 beg,'' said Mrs. Loss with a wave of her hand, and he opened the later
rather strenuously.-It was a beautiful letter, highly scented, on a pink
paper, and with a light green seal.
:Mo pure cler petit,'' (Mr. Crawley wrote). :` I could not sleep one
win for thinking of what had become of my odious old masters: and only
got to rest in the morning after sending for Mr. Bleach (for I was in
fever), who gave me a composing draught and left orders with Finette that
I should be disturbed on no account. So that my poor old man's mes-
senger, who had in nausea ine Finette says, and senator le Gexieore,
remained in the hall for some hours waiting my bell. ou may fancy my
state when I read your poor dear old ill-spelt letter.
 Ill as I was, I instantly called for the carriage, and as soon as I was
dressed (though I couldn't drink a drop of chocolate-I assure you I
couldn't without my monster to bring it to me), I drove centre a terre to
Nathan's. lI saw him-I wept-lI cruel--I fell at his odious knees.
Nothing would mollify the horrid man. He would have all the money, he
said, or keep my poor monster in prison. lI drove home with the intent-
tion of paying that trieste site clef mon onecle, (when every trinket I he
should be at your disposal though they would not fetch a hundred pounds
for some, you know, are with ce cler once already,) and found Minor there
with the Bulgarian old sheep-faced monster, who had come to compliant
me upon last night's performances. Paddington came in, too, drswling
and listing and dwindling his hair; so did Champiguae, and his chef-
everybody with poison of compliments and pretty speeches-plaguing pot
me, who longed to be rid of them, and was thinking every moment of the
time of mon pure prisoners.
When they were gone, I went down on my knees to Minor; told him
we were going to pawn everything, and begged and prayed him to give me
two hundred pounds. He pish'd and sha'd in a fury-told me not to be
such a fool as to pawn-and said he would see whether he could lead me
the money. At last he went away, promising that he would send it me
in the morning: when I will bring it to my poor old monster with a kiss

When Rawdon read over this letter, he turned so red and looked so
stage, that the company at the table d'vote easily perceived that bad news
had reached him. All his suspicions, which he had been trying to banish,
returned upon him. She could not even go out and sell her trinkets to
free him. She could laugh and talk about compliments paid to her, whilst
he was in prison. Who had put him there Denham had walked with
him. Was there.
. He would hardly bear to think of what he
suspected. Leaving the room hurriedly, he ran into his or-opened his
desk, wrote two hurried lines, which he directed to Sir Pitt or Lady
Crawley, and made the messenger carry them at once to Gaunt Street,

bidding him to take a cab, and promising him a guinea if he was back in
an hour.
In the note he besought his dear brother and sister, for the sake of God;
for the sake of his dear child and his honour:; to come to him and relieve
him from his difficulty. He was in prison : he wanted a hundred pounds
to set him free-he entreated them to come to him.
He went back to the dining-room after dispatching his messenger, and
called for more wine. He laughed and talked with a strange boisterous-
ness, as the people thought. Sometimes he laughed madly at his own
fears, and went on drinking for an hour; listening all the while for the
carriage which was to bring his fate baek.
At the expiration of that time, wheels were heard whirling up to kc gate
-the young Janitor went out with his gate-keys. It was a lady whom
he let in at the bailiff's door.

coLonel CRawley,'' she said, trembling very much. He, with a know-
ing look, looked the outer door upon her-then unlocked and opened the
inner one, and calling out, Colonel, you're wanted,'' led her into the
back parlour, which he occupied.
Rawdon came in from the dining-parlour where all those people were
carousing, into his back room ; a flare of coarse light following him into the
apartment where the lady stood, still very nervous.
4T8
VANITY FAIR.
 It is I, Rawdon,'' she said, in a timid voice, which she store to
render cheerful. ``It is Jane.'' Rawdon was quite overcome by that
kind voice and presence. He ran up to her-caught her in his arms-
gasped out some articulated words of thanks, and fairly sobbed on her
shoulder. She did not know the cause of his emotion.
The bills of Mr. Moss were quickly settled, perhaps to the disappoint-
ment of that gentleman, who hd counted on having the Colonel as his
guest over Sunday at least; and Jane, with beaming smiles and happy-
ness in her eyes, carried away Rawdon from the bailiff's house, and
they went homewurds in the car in which she had hastened to his
release. ``Pitt was gone to a parliamentary dinner,'' she said, ``when
Rawdon's note came, and so, dear Rawdon, I-I came myself;'' and she
put her kind hand in his. Perhaps it was well for Rawdon Crawley that
Pitt was away at that dinner. Rawdon thanked his sister a hundred
times, and with an armour of gratitude which touched and almost alarmed
that soft-hearted woman.  Oh,'' said he, in his rude, artless way, ``of
you don't know how I'm changed since I've known you, and-and little
Randy. I-I'd like to change somehow. Iou see I want-lI want-to
be-.''--He did not finish the sentence, but she could interpret it. And
that night after he left her, and as she sat by her own little boy's bed,
she prayed humbly for that poor wayward sinner.
Rawdon left her and walked home rapidly. It was nine clock at
night. He ran across the streets, and the great squares of Vanity Fair,
and at length come up breathless opposite his own house. He started
back and fell against the railings, trembling as he looked up. The drawing-
room windows were blazing with light. She had said that she was in bed
and ill. He stood there for some time, the light from the rooms on his
ple face.
He took out his door-key and let himself into the house. He could
lear laughter in the upper rooms. He was in the ball-dress in which he
had been captured the night before. He went silently up the stairs;
leaning against the lannisters at the stair-head.-Nobody was stirring in
the house besides-all the servants had been sent away. Ruwdon heard
laughter within-laughter and singing. Becky was singing a snatch of
the song of the night before; a hoarse voice shouted `Brava, Barra;''
-it was Lord Steyne's.
Radon opened the door and went in. A little table with a dinner was
Laid out-and wine and plate. Steyne was hanging over the sofa on
which Becky ste. The wretched woman was in a brilliant full toilette, her
arms and all her fingers sparking with bracelets and rings ;, and the brilliant
on her breast which Steyne had given her. He had her hand in his, and
was bowing over it to kiss it, when Becky started up with a faint series
as she caught sight of Rawdon's white face. At the next instant she tried
a smile, a horrid smile, as if to welcome her husband: and Steyne rose u
grinding his teeth, pale, and with fury in his looks.
He, too, attempted a laugh-and came forward holding out his hand.
What, come back How d'ye do, Crawley '' he said, the nerves of Mi
mouth twitching as he tried to grin at the intruder.
A NOEL WITHOUT A WHILE.
479
There was that in Rawdon's face which caused Becky to fling herself
before him. ``I am innocent, Rawdon,'' she said;  before God, I am
innocent.'' She clung hold of his out, of his hnuds; her own were all
covered with serpents, and rings, and numbers. ``I am innocent.-say I
am innocent,'' she said to Lord Steyne.
He thought a trap had been laid for him, and was as furious with the
wife as with the husband.  You innocent Dnn you,'' e streamed
out. ` You innocent Why every trinket you have on your body is paid
for by me. I have given you thousands of pounds which this fellow has
pent, and for which he has sold you. Innocent, by-1 you're as
innocent as your mother, the ballet-girl, and your husband the bully.
Don't think to frighten me as you have done others. Make way, sir,
and let me pss;'' and Lord Steyne sized up his hat, and, with flame in
his eyes, and looking his enemy fiercely in the face, arched upon him,
need for a moment doubting that the other would give way.
But Rawdon Crawley springing out, seized him by the neck-cloth, until
Steyne, almost strangled, writhed, and bent under his arm. ` You lie, you
dog l'' said Rewdon. ``ou lie, you coward and villain'' And he struck
the Peer twice over the face with his open hand, and flung him bleeding to
the ground. It was all done before Rebecca could interpose. She stood
there trembling before him. She admired her husband, strong, brave, and
victorious.
Come here,'' he said.-He came up at once.
Take off those things.''-She began, trembling, pulling the jewels
from her arms, and the rings from her shaking fingers, and led them all in
a heap, quivering and looking up at him.  Throw them down,'' he said,
and she dropped them. He tore the diamond ornament out of her breast,
and flung it at Lord Steyne. It cut him on his bald forehead. Steyne
wore the car to his dying day.
 Come up stairs,'' Rawdon said to his wife. :Don't kill me,
Rawdon,'' she said. He laughed savagely.-' I want to see if that man
lies about the money as he has about me. Has he given you any P''
 No,'' said Greece, ``that is-''
 Give me your keys,'' Rawdon answered, and they went out together.
Rebecca gave him all the keys but one: and she was in hopes that he
would not have remarked the absence of that. It belonged to the little
desk which Amelia had given her in early days, and which she kept in a
secret place. But Rawdon flung open boxes and wardrobe, throwing the
multifarious trumpery of their contents here and there, and at last he
found the desk. The woman was forced to open it. It contained papers,
love-letters many years old- all sorts of small trinkets and woman's
memoranda. And it contained a pocket-book with bank notes. Some
of these were dated ten years back, to, and one was quite a fresh one
-a note for a thousand pounds which Lord Steyne had given her.
 Did he give you this ?'' Rawdon said.
e Yes;'' Rebecca answered.
I 'Ll send it to him to-day,'' Rawdon said (for day had dawned again,
and many hours had passed in this search), ``'and I will pay Briggs, who
was kind to the boy, and some of the debts. ou will let me know
480
vANITY FAIR.
where I shall send the rest to you. you might have spared me a hundred
pounds, Becky, out of all this-I have always shared with you.''
``I am innocent,'' said Becky. And he left her without another word.
What were her thoughts when he left her? She remained for hours
after he was gone, the sunshine pouring into the room, and Rebecca sitting
alone on the bed's edge. The drawers were all opened and their contents
scattered about,-dresses and feathers, scarfs and trinkets, a heap ol
tumbled vanities lying in a wreck. Her hair was pulling over her shoulders;
her gown was torn where Rawdon had drenched the brilliant out of it. She
heard him go down stairs a few minutes after he left her, and the door
slamming and closing on him. She knew he would never come back. He
was gone for ever. Would he kill himself-she thought-not until after
he had met Lord Steyne. She thought of her long past life, and all the
dismal incidents of it. Ah, how dreary it seemed, how miserable, lonely
and profitlessl Should she take laudanum, and end it, to-have done
with all hopes, schemes, debts, and triumphs The French mid
found her in this position-sitting in the midst of her miserable ruins
with clasped hands and dry eyes. The woman was her accomplice and in
Steyne's pay. `` Mon Dieu, Madame, what has happened?'' she asked.
What had happened Was the guilty or not She said not; but who
could tell what was truth which came from those lips; or if that corrupt
heart was in this case pure All her lies and er schemes, all her selfish-
ncss and her wiles, all her wit and genius had come to this bankruptcy.
The woman closed the curtains, and with some entreaty and show of
kindness, persuaded her mistress to lie down on the bed. Then she went
below and gathered up the trinkets which had been lying on the floor since
Rebecca dropped them there at her husband's orders, and Lord Steyne
went away.

HE mansion of Sir Pitt Crawley
in Great Gaunt Street, was just
beginning to dress itself for the
day, as lnwdon, in his evening
costume, which he had now
worn to days, passed by the
scared female who was scouring
the steps, and entered into his
brother's study. lady Jane in
her morning-gown, was up and
above stairs in the nursery,
superintendent the toilettes of
her children, and listening to
the morning prayers which the
little creatures performed at her
knee. Every morning she and
they performed this duty pn-
lately, and before the public
ceremonial at which Bir Pitt
presided, nd at which all the
people of the household were
expected to assemble. Rawdon
sate down in the study before
the baronet's table, set out with the orderly blue books and the letters,
the neatly pocketed bills and symmetrical pamphlets; the locked account-
books, desks, and dispatch boxes, the Bible, the Quarterly Review, and
the Court Guide, which all stood as if on parade awaiting the inspection
of their chief.
A book of family sermons, one of which Sir Pitt was in the habit of
administering to his family on Sunday mornings, lay ready on the study
table, and awaiting his judicious selection. And by the sermon-book
was the Oeerer newspaper, damp and neatly folded, and for Sir Pitt's
own private use. THis gentleman alone took the opportunity of perusing
the newspaper before he said it by his master's desk. Before he had
brought it into the study that morning, he had read in the journal a
flaming account of `' Festivities at Gaunt Iousc,'' with the names of all the
distinguished personages invited by the Marquis of Steyne to meet his Royal
Highness. IIavringmadeeomments upon this entertainment to the place-

keeper and her niece as they were taking early tea and hot-buttered toast
in the former lady's apartment, and wondered how the Raiding Crawleys
would it on, the alert had damped and folded the paper one more, so
that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the arrival of the master of
the house.
Poor Rawdon took up the paper and began to try and real it until his
brother should arrive. But the print fell blank upon his eyes; and he did
not know in the least what he was reading. The Government news and
appointments, (which Sir Pitt as  public man was bound to peruse, other-
wise he would by no means permit the introduction of Sunday papers into
his household), the theatrical criticisms, the fight for a hundred pounds
a-side between the BArking Butler and the Tubular Pet, the Gaunt
HOuse chronicle itself, which contained a most complimentary though
guarded account of the famous charades of which Mrs. Becky had been the
heroine-all these passed as in a haze before Rawdon, as he sat waiting
the arrival of the chief of the family.
Tumnctually, as the shrill-toned tell of the black marble study clock
began to climb nine, Sir Pitt made his appearance, fresh, neat, smugly
shaved, with a waxy clean free, and stilfhirt dollar, his scanty hair combed
and oiled, trimming his nails as he descended the stairs majestically, in a
searched carat .and a gray flannel -dresjnggiwn,-a real old English
gentleman, in as word,-a model of neatness and  very propriety. He

 What is the matter, then ?'' soil Pitt, somewhat relied.
 It's the boy,'' said Rawdon, in a husky voice.  I want you to
promise me that you will take charge of him when I'm gone. That dear
good wife of yours has always been good to him; and he's founder of her
that he is of his. . .-Damn it. Look here, Pitt-you know that I was
to have and Miss Crawley's money. I wasn't brought up like a younger
brother: but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kept idle. But
for this I might have been quite a different man. I didn't do my duty
with the regiment so bad, You know how I was thrown over about the
money, and who got it.''
After the sacrifices I have male, and the manner in which Slave stool
by you, I think this sort of reproach is useless,'' Sir Pitt said. `Your
marriage was your own doing, not mine.''
That 's over now,'' said Rawlon.- That's over now.'' And the world
were drenched from him with a groan, which made his brother start.
Good God l is the dead'' Sir Pitt said, with a voice of genuine alarm
and commiseration.
I wish I was,'' Rawdon replied. If it wasn 't for little Rawdon I'd
have cut my throat this morning-and that damned villain's too,''
Sir Pitt instantly guessed the truth, and surmised that Lord Steyne
was the person whose life Rawdon wished to take. The Colonel told his
senior briefly, and in broken accents, the circumstances of the case.: It
was a regular plan between that ecoundrel and her,'' he said.  The bailifa
were put upon me: I was taken as I was going out of his house: when I
wrote to her for money, she said she was ill in bed, and put me off to
another day. And when I got home I found her in diamonds and sitting
with that villain alone.'' HE then went on to describe hurriedly the per-
sonar conflict with Lord Steyne. To an affair of that nature, of course, he
said, there was but one issue: and after his conference with his brother,
he was going away to make the necessary arrangements for the meeting
which must ensue. `And us it may end fatally for me,'' Rawdon said with
a broken voice, '`and as the boy has no mother, I must leave him to you
and Jane, Pitt-only it will be a comfort to me if you will promise me to
be his friend.''
The elder brother was much affected, and shook Rawdon's hand with a
cordiality seldom exhibited by him. Ruawdon passed his hand over his
slaggy eyebrows. `Thank you brother,'' said he. I know I can trust
your word.''
I will, upon my honour,'' the Bennett said. And thus, and almost
mntely, this margin was struck between them.
Then Rawdon took out of his pocket the little pocket-book which he had
discovered in Becky's desk: and from which he drew a bundle of the
notes which it contained. `` Here's six hundred,'' he said-``you didn't
know I was so rich. I want you to give the money to Briggs, who lent it to
us-and who was so kind to the boy-and I've always felt ashamed of
having taken the poor old woman's money. And here's some more-
I 've only kept back a few pounds-which becky may as well have, to get
on with. As he spoke he took hold of the other notes to give to his
brother : but his hands shook, and he was so agitated that the pocket-book

fell from him, and out of it the thousand pound note which had been the
last of the unlucky Becky's winnings.
Pitt stooped and picked them up, amazed at so much wealth. ` Notated,''
Rawdon said--`I hope to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs
to.'' He had thought to himself, it would be a fine revenge to wrap a ball
in the note, and kill Steyne with it.
AFter this colloquy the brothers once more shook hands and parted.
Lady Jane had heard of the Colonel's arrival, and was waiting for her
husband in the adjoining dining-room, with female instinct, auguring evil.
The door of the dining-room happened to be left open, and the lady of
course was issuing from it as the two brothers passed out of the study
She held out her land to Rawdon, and said she was glad he was come to
breakfast ; though she could perceive, by his haggard unshorn face, and the
dark looks of her husband, that there was very little question of breaks
between them. Rnwdon muttered some excuses about an engagement,
squeezing hard the timid little hand which his sister-in-law reached out to
him. Her imploring eyes could read nothing but calamity in lis free:
but he went away without another worl. Nor did Sir Pitt rouchsafe her
any explanation. The children came up to salute him, and he missed the
in his usual frigid manner. The mother took both of them close to her-
self, and held a hand of eneh of them as the knelt down to prayers, which
Sir Pitt rend to them, and to the servants in their Sunday suits or liveries,
ranged upon chairs on the other side of the hissing tea-guru. Breakfast
was so lute that day, in consequence of the delays which had occurred, that
the church-shells began to ring whilst they were sitting or their meal:
and Lady Jane was too ill, she said, to go to church, though er thoughts
had been entirely astray during the period of family devotion.
Radon Crowley meanwhile hurried on from Great Gaunt Street, and
knocking at the great bronze Medusa's head which stands on the portal of
Giant lIouse, brought out the purple Silenus in a red and silver waistcoat,
who acts as porter of that place. he man was scared also by the Colonel's
dishevclled appearance, and barred the way as if afraid that the other was
going to force it. But Colonel Crawley only took out a card and enjoined
him particularly to send it in to Lord Steyne, and to mark the address
written on it, and say that Colonel Crawley would be all day after one
o'clock at the event Club in St. James's Street-not at home. The fat
red-faced man looked after him with astonishment as he strode away; so did

there, and told the driver to take him to Knightsbridge Barracks.
All the bells were dangling and tolling as he reached that place. He
might have seen his old acquaintance Amelia on her way from Brompton
to Russell Square had he been looking out. Troops of schools were on
their march to church, the shiny pavement and outside of coaches in the
the suburbs were thronged with people out upon their Sunday pleasure;
but the Colonel was much too busy to take any heed of these phenomena,
and, arriving at Hnightsbridge, speedily made his way up to the room of

satisfaction, was in barracks.

the highest ranks, was enjoying the forenoon calmly in bed. He had been

at a fast supper-party, given the night before by taking the Honourable
George Cinqbnrs, at his house in Brompton Square, to several young men
of the regiment, and a number of ladies of the corps de ballet, and old Man,
who was at home with people of all ages and ranks, and contorted with
generals, dog-fanciers, opera-dancers, cruisers, and every kind of person, in
a word, was resting himself after the night's labours, and, not being on
duty, was in bed.
His room was hung round with boxing, sporting, and dancing pictures,
presented to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment, and mar-
died and settled into quiet life. And as he was now nearly fifty years of
age, twenty-four of which he had passed in the corps, he had a singular

museum. He was one of the best slots in England, and, for as head man,
one of the best riders; indeed, he and Crawley had been rivals when the
latter was in the army. To be brief, Mr. MIacmurdo was lying in bed,
reading in Bell's Life an account of the very fight between the Tubular
Pet and the Barking Butcher, which has been before mentioned-a gene-
rable bristly warrior, with a little close-shaved grey head, with a silk
nightcap, a red face and nose, and a great dyed moustache.
When Rawdon told the Captain he wanted a friend, the latter knew per-
fectly well on what duty of friendship he was called to act, and indeed had
conducted scores of fairs for his acquaintances with the greatest pr-
dence and skill. His Royal Highness the late lamented Commander-in-
Chief had had the greatest regard for Macmurdo on this account; and he
was the common refuge of gentlemen in trouble.
 What's the row about, Crawley, my boy ?'' said the old warrior.
No more gambling business, hay, like that when we shot Captain
Marker
It's about-about my wife,'' Crawley answered, casting down his
eyes and turning very red.
The other gave a whistle. :'I always said she'd throw you over,'' he
began :-indeed there were bets in the regiment and at the clubs regard-
in the probable fate of Colonel Crawley, so lightly was his wife's character
esteemed by his comrades and the world :-but seeing the savage look with
which Haddon answered the expression of this opinion, acmurdo did not
think it to enlarge upon it farther.
 Is there no way out of it, old hoy P'' the Captain continued in a gray
tone. '`Is it only suspicion, you know, or-or what is it Any letters'
Can't you keep it quiet? Best not make any noise about a thing of that
sort if you can help it,''  Think of his only finding her out now,'' the
Captain thought to himself, and remembered a hundred particular convcr-
nations at the mere-table, in which Mrs. Crawley's reputation had been
torn to shreds.
 There's no way but one out of it,'' Rawlon replied-`and there's only
a way out of it for one of us, Mao-do you understand? I was put out
of the way: arrested : I found 'em alone together. I told him he was
liar and a coward, and knocked him down and thrashed him.''
`Serve him right,'' Macmurdo sid.  Who is it'
Rawdon answered it was Lord Steyne.
eThe deucel a Marquis they said he-that is, they said you --'
 Want the devil do you mean'' roared out Rawdon ; ``do you mean
that you eer heard a fellow doubt about my wife, and didn't tell me,

 It was damned unfriendly, Mac,'' said Rawdon, quite extreme; and,
covering his face with his hands, he gave way to an emotion, the sight of
which caused the tough old campaigner opposite him to wine with
sympathy. 'Hold up, old boy,'' he said; ``grt an or not, we 'll pul

You don't know how fond I was of that one,'' Rawdon said, half

inarticulately.  Damme, I followed her like a footman. I gave up every-
thing I had to her. I'm a beggar because I would marry her. By Jove,
Bir, I've pawned my own watch in order to get her anything she fancied,
and she-she's been making a purse for herself all the time, and grulgel
me a hundred pound to get me out of quo.'' Ie then fiercely and inco-
recently, and with an agitation under which his counsellor hd ever
before seen him labour, told Maemurdo the circumstances of the story.
His advisor caught at some stray hints in it.
sHe may be innocent, after all,'' he said. She says so. Steyne has
been a hundred times alone with her in the house before,''
It may be so,'' Rawdon answered, sadly : `` but this don't look very
innocent :'' and he showed the Captain the thousand pound note which he
had found in Becky's pocket-took.  This is what he gave her, Mae:
and she kept it unknown to me: and with this money in the house, she
refused to stand by me when I was locked up.'' The Captain could not
but on that the secreting of the money had a very ugly look.
Whilst they were engaged in their conference, Rawdon dispatched
Captain Mnemurlo's servant to Curzon Street, with an order to the
domestic there to give up a bag of clothes of which the Colonel had great
neel. And during the man's absence, and with great labour and a
Johnson's Dictionary, which stood them in much stead, Rawdon and his
second composed a letter, which the latter was to send to Lord Steyne.
Captain Maemurdo had the honour of waiting upon the Marquis of
Steyne, on the part of Colonel Rawsdon Crawley, and begged to intimate
that he was empowered by the Colonel to make any arrangements for the
meeting which, he had no doubt, it was his Lordship's intention to
demand, and which the circumstances of the morning had rendered
inevitable. Captain Maemurdo begged Lord Steyne, in the most polite
manner, to appoint a friend, with whom he (Captain M`ML.) might com-
indicate, and desired that the meeting might take place with as little
delay as possible.
In a postscript the Captain stated that he had in his possession a bank-
vote for a large amount, which Colonel Crawley had reason to suppose
was the property of the Marquis of Steyne. And he was anxious, on the
Colonel's behalf, to give up the note to its owner.
By the time this note was composed, the Captain's servant returned
from his mission to Colonel Crawley's house in Curzon Street, but without
the carpet-bag and portmanteau, for which he had been sent: and with a
very pulled an odd face.
They won't a give 'em up,'' said the man; ``there's a regular slinty
in the house; and everything at sixes and sevens. The landlord's come
in and took possession. The servants was a drinking up in the drawing-
room. `They said-they said you had a one off with this plate, Colonel''
-the man added after a pause :--`One of the servant is off already.
And Simpson, the man us was very noisy and drunk indeed, says nothing
shall go out of the house until his wages is paid up.''
The account of this little revolution in My Fair astonished and gave a
little gaiety to an otherwise very trieste conversation. The two officers
laughed at Rawdon's discomfiture.

I'm glad the little 'un isn't at home,'' Rawdon said, biting his nails.
 You remember him, Mac, don't you, in the Riding School How he sat
the kicker to be sure didn't heLP''
That he did, old boy,'' said the good-natured Captain.
Little Rawlon was then sitting, one of fifty gown-boys, in the Chapel of
WVhitefriars School : thinking, not about the sermon, but about going home
next Saturday, when his father would certainly tip him, and perhaps would
take him to the play.
It's a regular trump, that by,'' the father went on, still musing
about his son. `` I say, Mae, if anything goes wrong-if I drop-I should
like you to-to go and see him, you know: and say that I was very fond
of him, and that. And-dash it-old chap, gie him these gold sleep-
buttons : it's all I've got. Ie covered his face with his black hands:
over which the tens rolled and made furrows of white. Mr. Macmurdo
had also occasion to take off his silk night-cap and rub it across his eyes.
Go down and order some breakfast,'' he said to his man in a loud
cheerful voice,-- WHat 'If you have, Crawley Some devilled kidney
and a herring-let's say-A, Clay, lay out some messing things for
the Colonel: we were always pretty much of a size, Rawdon, my boy, and
neither of us ride so light as we did when we first entered the corps.''
With which, and leaving the Colonel to dress himself, Maemurdo turned
round towards the wall, and resumed the perusal of all'e Life, until such
time as his friend's toilette was complete, and he was at liberty to com-
indeed his own.
This, as he was about to meet a Lord, Captain Macmurdo performed
with particular care. IIe waxed his mustaclios into a state of brilliant
polish, and put on a tight craft and a trim buff waistcoat : so that all
the young officers in the mess-room, whither Crawley had preceded his
friend, complimented Mac on his appearance at breakfast, and asked if he
was going to be married that Sunday?

-no, not though her mistress,
in a great pet, and with the
bell-rope in her hand, came
out to the landing-place with her hair or her shoulders, and screamed out
repeatedly for her attendant.
The truth is, she had quieted the premises for many hours, and upon
that permission which is called French leave among us. After picking up
the trinkets in the drawing-room, Mademoiselle had ascended to her own
apartments, packed and corded her own boxes there, tripped out and
called a cab for herself, brought down her trunks with her own hand, and
without ever so much is asking the aid of any of the other servants, who
would probably have refused it, as they hated her cordially, and without
wishing any one of them good-bye, had made her exit from Curzon Street.
The game, in her opinion, was over in that little domestic establishment.
Office went off in a cab, as we have known more exalted persons of her
nation to do under similar circumstances: but, more provident or lucky
than these, she secure not only her own property, but some of her
mistress's (if indeed that lady could be said to have any property at all)-

dresses on which he had long kept her eye, but four richly gilt Louis

equator candlesticks, six gilt Albums, KEepsake, and Books of Beauty,a
gold enamelled snuff-box which had once belonged to Madame du Barri,
and the sweetest little instead and mother-of-pearl blotting-book, which
Becky used when she composed her charming little pink notes, had vanished
from the premises in Curzon Street together with Mademoiselle Office, and
all the silver laid on the table for the little festin which Rawdon interrupted.
The plated ware Mademoiselle left behind her as too cumbrous probably,
for which reason, no doubt, she also left the fire irons, the chimney-glasses,
and the rosewood cottage piano.
A lady very like her subsequently kept a milliner's shop in the Rue du
Helder nt Paris, where she lives with great credit and enjoyed the patron-
age of my Lord Steyne. This person always spoke of England as of the
most treacherous country in the world, and stated to her young pupils
that she had been agreement sole' by natives of that island. It was no
doubt compassion for her misfortunes which induced the Marquis of Steyne
to be so very kind to Madame de Saint Amaranthe. May she flourish as
she deserves,-she appears no more in our quarter of Vanity Fair.
Hearing a buzz and a stir below, and indignant at the impudence of
those servants who would not answer her summons, Mrs. Crawley flung
her morning robe round her, and descended majestically to the drawing-
room, whence the noise proceeded.
The cook was there with blackened face, seated on the beautiful chintz
sofa by the side of Mrs. Raggles, to whom she was administering hiaras-
chino. The page with the sugar-loaf buttons, who carried about Becky's
pink notes, and jumped about her little carriage with sch alacrity, was
now engaged putting his fingers into a cream dish; the footman was talk-
in to angles, who had a face full of perplexity and we-and yet, though
the door was open, and Becky had been screaming a half dozen of times a
few feet of, not one of her attendants had obeyed her cll. Have a little
drop, do'we now Mrs. Raggles,'' the cook was saying as Becky entered,
the white cashmere dressing gown flocking around her.
``Simpson Trotter1'' the mistress of the house cried in great wrath.
' How dure you stay here when you heard me call low dare you sit
down in my presence Where's my main'' The page withdrew his
fingers from his mouth with a momentary terror: but the cook took of a
glass of Maraschino, of which Mrs. Raggles hal had enough, staring at
BEcky over the little gilt glass as she drained its contents. The liquor
appeared to give the odious rebel courage.

glen's soft. Don't you stir, Mrs. Raggles, Mum. I'm a setting' on
Mr. and Mrs. Haggles's soft, which they ought with honest money, and
very dear it cost 'em, too. And I'm thinking' if I set here until i'm paid my

drank it with a more hideously satirical air.

Crowley.
`:1 shawn't,'' said Trotter the footman; ``turn out yourself. Pay our
galleries, and turn me out too. I 'll go fast enough.''

`Are you all here to insult me'' cericd Becky in a fury; ` when
Colonel Crawley comes home I'll--.''
At this the servants burst into n hoarse hn-haw, in which, however,
Raggles, who still kept a most melancholy countenanee, did not join. `He
ain't a coming back,'' Mr. Trotter resumed.  He sent for his things, and
I would' let 'me go, although Mr. Raggles would: and I don't b'like
he's no more a Colonel than i am. Ile's off: and I suppose you'rican
goin' after him. You're no better than swindlers, both on you. Don't
be a bullying' e. I won't stand it. Put us our galleries, I say. Pay us
our galleries,'' It was evident, from Mr. Trotter's flushed countenance
and defective intonation, that he, too, had had recourse to venous
stimulus.
Mr. Raggles,'' suid Becky, in a passion of vexation, `` you will not
rely let me be insulted by that drunken man'' :Holl your noise,
Trotter; do now,'' said Simpson the page. He was affected by his mis-
truss's deplorable situation, and succeeded in preventing an outrageous
denial of the epithet `drunken' on the footman's part.
O Mam,'' said Raggles, `'`I refer thought to live to see this year day.
I'e known the Crawley fully cover since I was born. Lived butler with
Miss Crawley for thirty years; and I little thought one of that family was

his eyes. ``Har you n goin' to play you've lived in this ouse four

cook. Many 's the time, he'd have starved but for me.''

enumeration of his griefs. All he said was true. Becky and her husband

This audacious statement caused Raggles and the other personages
present to look at one another with a wild surprise, nnl with it Rebecca
left them. She went up stairs and dressel herself this time without the
aid of her French maid. he went into Lawson's room, and there saw

woman's garret; everything was clean, and all the drawers emptied there.
She bethought herself of the trinkets which had been left on the ground,
and felt certain that the woman had fled.  Good Heavens was ever
such ill luck as mine2'' she said ; ``to be so near, and to lose all. Is it
all too late To; there was one chance more,''
She dressed herself, and went away unmolested this time, but alone. It
was four o'clock. She went swiftly down the streets (she had no money to
pay for a carriage), and never stopped until she came to Sir Pitt Crawley's
door, in Great Gunt Street. Where was Ldy Jane Crawley She was
at church. Becky was not sorry. Sir Pitt was in his study, and had
given orders not to be disturbed-she must see him-she slipped by the
sentinel in livery at once, and was in Sir Pitt's room before the astonished
Baronet had even laid down the paper.
IIe turned rel aud started back from her with a look of great alarm and
horror.
 Do not look so,'' she said. ` I am not guilty, Pitt, dear Pitt; you
were my friend one. Before God, I am not guilty. I seem so. Very-
thing is against me. And Of at such a moment just when all my hopes
were about to be realised: just when happiness was in store for us.''
In this true, what I see in the paper, ten%'' Sir Pitt said-a para-
graph in which had greatly surprised him.
 It is true. Lord Steyne told me on Friday night, the night of that
fatal ball. He has been promised an appointment any time these six
months. Mr. Martyr, the Colonial Secretary, told him yesterday that
it was made out. That unlucky arrest ensued; that horrible meeting.
I was only guilty of too much devotedness to Rawdon's service. I hae
received Lord Steyne alone a hundred times before. I confess I had
money of which awdon knew nothing. Don't you know how careless he
is of it, and could I dare to confide it to him?'' And so she went on
with a perfectly connected story, which she poured into the ears of her
perplexed kinsman.
It was to the following effect. Becky owned, and with perfect frank-
ness, but deep contrition, that having remarked Lord Steyne's partiality
for her (at the mention of which Pitt flushed), and being secure of her
own virtue, she had determined to turn the great peer's attachment to the
advantage of herself and her family. ``I looked for a peerage for you,
Pitt,'' she said, (the brother-in-law again turned red).  We have talked
about it. our genius and Lord Steyne's interest made it more tau
probable, lad not this dreadful calamity come to put an end to all our
hopes. But, first, I own that it was my object to rescue my dear hus-
band,-lim whom I love in spite of all his ill usage and suspicions of
me,-to remove him from the poverty and ruin which was impending over
us. I saw Lord Steyne's partiality for me,'' she said, casting down her
eyes.``I own that I did everything in my power to make myself pleasing
to him, and as far as an honest woman may, to secure his-his esteem.
It was only on Friday morning that the news arrived of the death of the
Governor of Coventry Island, and my Lord instantly secured the appoint-
ment for my dear husband. It was intended as a surprise for him,-he was
to see it in the papers to-day. Even after that horrid arrest took place (at

expenses of which Lord Steyne generously said he would settle, so that 1
was in a manner prevented from coming to my husband's assistance), my
Lord waslaughing with me, and saying that my dearest Rawdon would be
console when he read of his appointment in the paper, in that shocking
spun- bailiff's house. And then-then he came home. His suspicions
were excited,-the dreadful scene took place between my Lord and my
cruel, cruel Rawdon,-and, O my Go, what will happen net Pitt,
dear Pitt pity me, and reconcile usl'' And as she spoke she flung
herself down on her knees, and bursting into tears, seized hold of Pitt's
hand, which she kissed passionately.
It was in this very attitude that Lady Jane, who, returning from church,
ran to her husband's room directly she henry Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was
closeted there, found the Baronet and his sister-in-law.

Lady Jane said, trembling in every limb, and turning quite pale. (Her
ladyship had sent out her maid directly after breakfast, who had comma-
united with Raggles and Rawdon Crawley's household, who had told her
all, and a great deal more than they knew, of that story, and many others
besides).  How are MIrs. Crawley to enter the house of-of an honest

Sir Pitt started back, amazed at his wife's display of vigour. Becky
still kept her kneeling posture, and clung to Sir Pitt's hand.

Upon my word, my love, I think you do Mrs. Crowley injustice,'' Sir
Pitt said; at which speech Rebecca was vastly relied.  Indeed I
believe her to be-.''

heart beating violently as she spoke. To be a wicked woman-a heart-

to fly here and tell me of her cruelty to lim. She never came into a
family but she strove to bring misery with her, and to weaken the most

continued, intrepidly; ` I have kept my marriage vow as I made it to
Go, and have been obedient and gentle as a wife should. But righteous
obedience has its limits, and I declare that I will not bear that-that
woman again under my roof : if she enters it, I and my children will
leave it. She is not worthy to sit down with Christian people. ou-
you must choose, Sir, between her and me;'' and with this my Lady swept
out of the room, fluttering with her on audacity, and leaving rebecca
and Sir Pitt not a little astonished nt it.
As for Becky, she wanted hurt; nay, she was pleased: It was the
clinton-clasp you gare me,'' she said to Sir Pitt,reaching him out her hand;
and before she left him (for which seventy may be sure my Lady Jane
was looking out from her dressing-room: window in the upper story) the
Banronet had promised to and seek out his brother; and endeavour to
bring about a reconciliation..
Rawdon found some of the young fellows of the regiment seated in the
mass-room at breakfast, and was induced without much. difficulty to par-
take of that men, and of the devilled legs of fowls aud. soda-water with
which these young gentlemen fortified themsclires. Then they had a con-
version befitting the day and their time of life : about the next pigeon-
match at Bnttersea, with relative bets upon oss and Osbaldiston: about
MIademoiselle Ariane of the French Opera, and who had left her, and how
she was consoled by Panther Carr; and about the fight between the Butcher
and the Set, and the probabilities that it was a cross. oung Tandyman,
a hero of seventeen, laboriously endeavouring to get up a pair of musta-
chios, had seen the fight, and spoke in the most scientific manner about the
battle, and the condition of the men. It was he who had driven the
Butcher on to the ground in his drag, and passed the whole of the pre-
virus night with him. Had there not been foul play he must have won it.
All the old files of the Ring were in it: and Handyman wouldn't pay; ne.

so knowing a hand in Crib's parlour, had a still lingering liking for toffy,
and used to be birched at Eton.
So they went on talking about dancers, fights, drinking, emirates, until
Maemurdo came down and joined the boys and the conversation. He did
not appear to think that any special reverence was due to their boyhood;
the old fellow cut in with stories, to the full as choice as any the youngest
rake present and to tell ;-nor did his own gray hairs, nor their smooth faces
detain him. Old One was famous for his good stories. He was not exactly
a lady's man; that is, men asked him to dine rather at the houses of their
mistresses than of their mothers. Tere can scarcely be a life lower, per-
has, than his ; but he was quite contented with it, such as it was, and led
it in perfect good nature, simplicity, and modesty of demeanour.
By the time MAc had finished a copious breakfast, most of the others
had concluded their meal. oung Lord Varinas was smoking an immense
MIeersehaum pipe, while Captain klugues was employed with a cigar: that
violent little devil Tandyman, with his little bull-terrier between his legs,
was tossing for shillings with all his might (that fellow was always at
some game or other) against Captain Deceased: and Mac and Rawdon
walked off to the Club, neither, of course, having gien any hint of the
business which was occupying their minds. Both, on the other hand,
had joined pretty gaily in the conversation; as, why should they interrupt
itP Feasting, drinking, ribaldry, laughter, go on alongside of all sorts of
other occupations in Vanity Fair,-the crowds were pouring out of church
ns Rawdon and his friend passed down Saint James's Street and entered
into their Club.
The oll bucks and habitues, who ordinarily stand gaping and grinning
out of the great front window of the Club, had not arrived at their posts
is yet,-the newspaper-room was almost empty. One man was present
whom HRawdon did not know; another to whom he owed a little score for
whist, and whom, in consequence, he did not care to meet ; a third was
reading the loyalist (a periodical famous for its scandal and its attachment
to Church and King) sunday paper at the table, and, looking up at Crawley
with some interest, said, ` Crawley, l congratulate you.''
 What do you mean '' said the Colonel.
`It 's in the Polarizer and the Royalist too,'' said Mr. Smith.
What '' Rawdon cried, turning very red. He thought that the affair
with Lord Steyne was already in the public prints. Smith looked up
wondering and smiling at the agitation which the Colonel exhibited as he
took up the paper, and trembling, began to read.
Mr. Smith and MIr. Brown (the gentleman with whom Rawdon had the
outstanding whist account) had been talking about the Colonel just before
he came in.
It is come just in the nick of time,'' said Smith. `' I suppose Crawley
had not a shilling in the world.''
It 's a wind that blows everybody good,'' Mr. Brown said.  He can't
go away without paying me a pony he owes me.''
 What 's the salary '' asked Smith.

`` Some people say his brother is a very clever man.''  I always found

'..aden
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband,'' answered the other,
enigmatically, and went to read his papers.
Rawdon, for his part, read in the Royalist the following astonishing
paragraph:-
GovErNoRS oOP CovENTRY IsLAND.-H.M.S. ellowjaek, Com-
mander Saunders, has brought letters and papers from Coventry Island.
H. E. Sir Thomas Liverscege had fallen a victim to the prevailing fever at
Swamptown. His loss is deeply felt in the flourishing colony. We hear
that the Governorship has been offered to Colonel Rawdon Crawley, C.B.,
a distinguished WAterloo officer. We need not only men of acknowledged
bravery, but men of administrative talents to superintend the affairs of
our colonies; and we have no doubt that the gentleman selected by the
Colonial Office to fill the lamented vacancy which has occurred at Coventry
Island is admirably calculated for the post which he is about to occupy.''
 Coventry Island where was it who had appointed him to the govern-
ment You must take me out as your secretary, old boy,'' Captain MIne-
murdo said laughing; and ns Crawley and his friend set wondering and
perplexed over the announcement, the Club waiter brought in to the
Colonel a card, on which the name of M. Denham was engraved, who
begged to see Colonel Crawley.
The Colonel and his aide-de-camp went out to meet the gentleman,
rightly conjecturing that he was an emissary of Lord Steyne. ` How d'ye
do, Crawley I am glad to see you,'' said Mr. Denham, with a bland smile,
and grasping Crawley's land with great cordiality.
e You come, I suppose, from --''
 Exactly,'' said Mr. Wenhm.
 Then this is my friend Captain Macmurdo of the Life Guards Green.''
Delighted to know Captain Maecmurdo, I'm sure,'' Mr. Denham said,
and tendered another side and shake of the hand to the second, as he had
done to the principal. Mac pul out one finger, armed with a buckskin
glove, and made a very frigid bow to Mr. Denham over his tight craft.
He was, perhaps, discontented at being put in communication with a
pepin, and thought that Lord Steyne should have sent him a Colonel at
the very least.
"`As Macmurdo sets for me, and knows what I mean,'' Crawley said, `1
had better retire anl leave you together.''
Of course,'' said Maemurdo.
By no means, my denr Colonel,'' M, Denham said; ``' the interview
which I had the honour of requesting was with you personally, though the
company of Captain Mncmurlo cannot fail to be also most pleasing. In

fact, Captain, I hope that our conversation will lead to one but the most
agreeable results, very different from those which my friend Colonel Crawley
appears to anticipate.'
Humphl'' asia Captain Maemurdo.-Bchangeltaothese civilians, he
thought to himself, they are always for arranging and specifying. MIr.
Bentham took a chair which was not offered to him-took a paper from
his pocket, and resumed-

Hanged, if I know,'' the Captain said: his principal turned very red.
 To one of the most generous and kindest men in the world, as he is
one of the great-to my excellent friend, the Marquis of Steyne.''

resumed: ``and now, in the name of common sense and justice, tell me
why''

Damm, indeed,'' asid Mr, Denham, with the most agreeable smile;
still, look at the matter as a man of the world-as an honest man, and
see if you have not been in the wrong. ou come home from a journey,
and find-what?-my Lord Steyne supping at your house in Curzon
Street with Mr. Crawley. Is the circumstance strange or novel? Has
he not been a hundred times before in the same position Upon my
honour and word as a gentleman,'' (Mr. Denham here put his hand
on his waistcoat with a parliamentary air), ``I declare I think that your
suspicions are monstrous and utterly unfounded, and that they injure an
honourable gentleman who has proved his good will towards you by a
thousand benefactions-and a most spotless and innocent lady.'
You don't mean to say that-that Crawley's mistaken ?'' said MIr.
Mnemurdo.
`I believe that Mrs. Crawley is as innocent as my wife, Mrs. Denham,''
Mr. Denham said, with great energy. ``I believe that, misled by an
infernal jealousy, my friend here strikes a blow against not only an infirm
and old man of high station, his constant friend and benefactor, but against
his wife, his own dearest honour, his son's future reputation, and his own
prospects in life.
:I will tell you what happened,'' Mr. Denham continued with great
solemnity; ``I was sent for this morning by my Lord Steyne, and found
him in a pitiable state, as, I need hardly inform Colonel Crawley, any man
of age and infirmity would be after a personal conflict with a man of your
strength. I say to your face; it was a cruel advantage you took of
the strength, Colonel Crawley. It was not only the body of my noble
and excellent friend which was wounded-his heart, Sir, was bleeding.

A man whom he had loaded with benefits and regarded with affection, had
subjected him to the foulest indignity. What was this very appointment,
which appears in the journals of to-day, but a proof of his kindness to you

indeed to see; and as anxious as you are to revenge the outrage com-
fitted upon him, by blood. You know he has given his proofs, I presume,
Colonel Crawley P''
tHe has plenty of pluck,'' said the Colonel. e Nobody eer said he
hadn't.
 His first order to me was to write a letter of challenge, and to carry it
to Colonel Crawley. One or other of you,'' he said, ``must not survive
the outrage of last night.''
Crawley nodded. You 're coming to the point, Denham,'' he said.
 I tried my utmost to calm Lord Steyne. Good God1 Sir,'' I said,
how I regret that Mr. Denham and myself had not accepted Mrs.
Crawley's invitation to up with her1''
 She asked you to up with her'' Captain Naemurdo said.
'After the Opera. Here's the note of imitation-stop-no, this is
another paper-I thought I had it, but it's of no consequence, and I
pledge on my word of honour as a gentleman to the fact. If we had come
-and it was only one of Mrs. Welham's headaches which prevented us
-she suffers under them a good deal, especially in the spring-if we had
come, and you had returned home, there would have been no quarrel, no
insult, no suspicion-and so it is positively because my poor wife hasa
headache that you are to bring death down upon two men of honour, and
plunge two of the most excellent and ancient families in the kingdom into
disgrace and sorrow,''
Mr, Maecmurdo looked at his principal with the air of a man profoundly
puzzled : and Rawdon felt with a kind of rage that his prey was escaping
him. He did not believe a word of the story, and yet, how discredit or
disprove it?
Mr. Denham continued with the same fluent oratory, which in his place
in parliament he had so often practised-`' I sate for an hour or more by
Lord Steyne's bedside, beseeching, imploring Lord Steyne to forego hi
intention of demanding a meeting. I pointed out to him that the cream-
stances were after all suspicious-they were suspicious. I acknowledge it,
any man in your position might have been taken in-I said that a man
furious with jealousy is to all intents and purposes a madman, and should
be as such regarded-that a duel between you must lead to the disgrace of
all parties concerned-that a man of his Lordship's exalted station had no
right in these days, when the most atrocious revolutionary principles, and
the most dangerous levelling doctrines are preached among the vulgar, to
create a public scandal; and that, however innocent, the common people
would insist that he was guilty. In fine, I implored him not to send the
challenge,''
I don't believe one word of the whole story,'' said Rawlon, grinding
his teeth.  I believe it n model lic, and that you 're in it, Mr, Wenha.
If the challenge don't come from him, by Jove it shall come from me.''
MF. BEntham turned deadly pale at this savage interruption of the
Colonel, and looked towards the door.
A OPEL WITHOUT 1 HER0.

But he found a champion in Captain Macmurdo. That gentleman rose
up with an oath, and rebuked Rawdon for his language.  You put the
alTair into my hands, and you shall act as I think it, by Love, and not as
you do. Iouhave no right to insult Mr. Denham with this sort of language;
and dummy, Mr. Denham, you deserve an apology. And as for a chal-
lange to Lord Steyne, you may get somebody else to carry it, I won't. If
my lord, after being thrshed, chooses to sit still, dummy let him. And
as for the affair with-with Mrs. Crawley, my belief is, there 's nothing
proved at all: that your wife 's innocent, as innocent and Mr. Denham says
she is: and at any rate, that you would be a d-fool not to take the place
and hold your tongue.''
Captain Mnemurdo, you speak like a man of sense,'' Mr. Denham
cried ont, immensely relieved- I forget any words that Colonel Crawley
has used in the irritation of the moment.''
I thought you would,'' Rawdon said, with a sneer.
"`Shut your mouth, you old stoopid,'' the Captain sei good-naturedly.
Mr. denham ain't a fighting man; and quite right, too.''
e This matter, in my belief,'' the Steyne emissary cried, ``ought to be
buried in the most profound oblivion. A word concerning it should never
pass these doors. I speak in the interest of my friend, as well as of
Colonel Crawley, who persists in considering me his enemy.''
I suppose Lord Steyne won't talk about it very much,'' said Captain
Maemurdo; ` and i don't see why our side should. The affair ain't a
very pretty one, any way you take it ; and the less said about it the better.
It 's you are thrashed, and not us; and if you are satisfied, why, I think,
we should be,''
Mr. Denham took his hat, upon this, and Captain Macmurdo following
him to the door, shut it upon himself and Lord Steyne's agent, leaving
Rawdon ehafing within. When the two were on the other side, Macmurdo
looked hard at the other ambassador, and with an expression of anything
but respect on his round jolly face.
 You don't stick at a trifle, Mr. Denham,'' he said.
You flatter me, Captain Maemurdo,'' answered the other, with a smile.
`Upon my honour and conscience, now, Mrs. Crawley did ask us to up
after the Opera.''
Of course; and Are. Denham had one of her headaches. I say, I've
got a thousand-pound note here, which I will give you if you will give me
a receipt, please; and I will put the note up in an envelope for Lord
Steyne. My man shan't fight him. But we had rather not take his
money.''
It was all a mistake,-all a mistake, my dear Sir,'' the other said,
with the utmost innocence of manner; and was bowed down the Club
steps by Captain Macmurdo, just as Sir Pitt Crawley ascended them.
There was a slight acquaintance between these to gentlemen; and the
Captain, going neck with the Baronet to the room where the latter's
brother was, told Sir Pitt, in confidence, that he had made the fair all
right between Lord Steyne and the Colonel.
Sir Pitt was well plcsel, of course, at this intelligence; anl congratu-
later his brother early upon the peaceful issue of the affair, making

appropriate moral remarks upon the evils of duelling, and the satisfactory
nature of that sort of settlement of disputes.
And after this preface, he tried with all his eloquence to effect a reason-
iliation between Rawdon and his wife. He reespitlated the statements
which Becky had made, pointed out the probabilities of their truth, and
asserted his own firm belief in her innocence.
But Rawdon would not hear of it,  8he has kept money concealed
from me these ten years,'' he said.  She swore, last night only, she had
none from Steyne. She knew it was all up, directly I found it. If she 's
not guilty, Pitt, she 's as bad as guilty; and I 'll never see her again,--
never,'' HIs head sank down on his chest as he spoke the words; and he
looked quite broken and sad.
pOor old boy,'' Maemurdo said, shaking his head.
Rawdon Crawley resisted for some time the idea of taking the place
which had been procured for him by so odious a patron : and was also for
removing the boy from the school where Lord Steyne's interest had passed
him. He was joined, however, to acquiesce in these benefits by the
entreaties of his brother and Mcmurdo: but mainly by the latter pointing
out to him what a fury Steyne would be in, to think that his enemy's
fortune was made through his means.
When the Marquis of Steyne same abroad after his accident, the Colo-
nial Secretary bowed up to him and congratulated himself and the Service
upon having made so excellent an appointment. These congratulations
were received with a degree of gratitude which may be imagined on the
part of Lord Steyue.
The secret of the rendered between him and Colonel Crawley was buried
in the profoundest oblivion, ns Wenhm said; that is by the seconds and
the principals. But before that evening was over it was talked of at
fifty dinner-tables in Vanity Fair. Little Cackleby himself went to seen
evening parties, and told the story with comments and emendations at
each place. How Mrs. WAshington Whitrevelled in it1 The Bishops
of Ealing was shocked beyond expression: the Bishop went and wrote his
name down in the visiting-book at Gaunt House that very day. Little
Touchdown was sorry: so you may be sure was his sister Lady Jane, very
sorry. Lady Touchdown wrote it off to her other daughter at the Cape of
Good Hope. It was town-talk for at least three days, and was only kept
out of the newspapers by the exertions of Mr. Wage, acting upon a hint
from Mr. Denham.
The bailiffs and brokers seized upon poor angles in Curzon Street, and
the late fair tenant of that poor little mansion was in the meanwhile-
where Who cared W'ho asked after a day or two Was the guilty
or not: We all know how charitable the world is, and how the verdict
of Vanity Fair goes when there is a doubt. Some people said she had
gone to Naples in pursuit of Lord Steync; whilst others averred that his
Lordship quieted that city, and fled to Palermo on hearing of BEcky's
arrival; some said she was living in Bierstadt, and had become a damn
d Honneur to the queen of Bulgaria; some that she was at Boulogne;
au others, at a boarding-house at Cheltenham.

Rawdon made her a tolerable annuity; and we may be sure that she was
a woman who could make a little money to a great way, as the saying is.
He would have paid his debts on leaving england, could he have got any
Insurance Office to take his life ; but the climate of Coventry Island was
so bad that he could borrow no money on the strength of his annuity.
He remittel, however, to his brother punctually, and wrote to his little
boy regularly every mail. He kept Macmurdo in cigars; and sent over
quantities of shells, cayenne pepper, hot pickles, guava jelly, and colonial
produce to Lady Jane. He sent his brother home the Swamp TOngue
Gazette, in which the new Governor was praised with immense enthusiasm;
whereas, the amp Boon Sentinel, whose wife was not asked to Govern-
ment House, declared that his Excellency was a tyrant, compared to whom
Nero was an enlightened philanthropist. Little Rawdon used to like to
get the papers and read about his Excellency.
His mother never made any movement to see the child. He went
home to his aunt for Sundays aud holidays; ho soon knew every bird's
nest about queen's Crawley, and rode out with Sir Huddlestone's hounds,
which he admired so on his first well-remembered visit to Hampshire.

been reading during the day, and was greatly interested at the report the
boy gave of his own studies: pretending to understand little George when
he spoke regarding them. lIe made a hundred blunders, and showed his
ignorance many a time. It did not increase the respect which the child
had for his senior. A quick brain and a better education elsewhere showed
the boy very soon that his grandsire was a dillard: and he began accord-
singly to command lim and to look down upon him; for his previous
education, humble and contracted as it had been, had made a much better
gentleman of Georgy than any plans of his grandfather could make him.
He had been brought up by a kind, weak, and tender woman, who had no
pride about anything, but about him, and whose heart was so pure and
whose bearing was so meek and humble, that she could not but needs be a
true lady. She busied herself in gentle offices and quiet duties ; if she
never said brilliant things, she never spoke or thought uukind ones:
guileless and artless, loving and pure, indeed how could our poor little
Amelia be other than a real gentlewomanf
Young Georgy world over this soft and yielding nature; and the con
trast of its simplicity and delicacy with the coarse pomposity of the dull
old man with whom he next came in contact, made him lord over the
latter too. If he had been a Prince Royal he could not have been better
brought up to think well of himself.
Whilst his mother was yearning after him at home, and I do believe
every hour of the day, and during most hours of the sad lonely nights,
thinking of him, this young gentleman had a number of pleasures and
consolations administered to him, which made him for his part bear the
separation from Amelia very easily. Little boys who cry when they are
going to school-cry because they are going to a very uncomfortable
place. It is only a very few who weep from sheer affection. When you
think that the eyes of your childhood dried at the sight of a piece of
gingerbread, and that a plum-cake was a compensation for the agony of
parting with your mamma and sisters; OF my friend and brother, you need
not be too confident of your own fine feelings.
Well, then, Master George Osborne had every comfort and luxury that
a wealthy and lavish old grandfather thought fit to provide. The coach-
man was instructed to purchase for him the handsomest pony which
could be bought for money; and on this George was taught to ride, first
at a riding-school, whence, after he had performed satisfactorily without
stirrups, and over the leaping-bar, he was conducted through the New
Road to Regent's Park, and then to Hyde Park, where he rode in state
with Martin the coleman behind him. Old Oborne, who took matters
more easily in the City now, where he left his affairs to his junior partners,
would often ride out with Miss O. in the same fashionable direction. As
lIttle Georgy came catering up with his playfield air, and his heels down,
his grandfather would nudge the law's aunt, and say, ``Look, Miss O''
And he would laugh, and his face would grow red with pleasure, as he
nodded out of the window to the boy, as the groom saluted the carriage,
and the footman saluted Master George. Herbert his aunt, Mrs. Frederick

Though he was scarcely eleven years of age, Mater George wore strips
and the most beautiful little boots like a man. He hal gilt spurs, and
gold-headed whip, and a fine in in his handkerchief; and the nearest
little kid gloves which Lamb's Conduit Street could furnish. His- mother
had given him a couple of neck-cloths, and carefully hemmed and made
some little shirts for him; but when her Eli came to see the widow, they
were replaced by much finer linen. He had little jewelled nations in the
lawn shirt-fronts. Her humble presents had been put aside-I believe
Miss Osborne had given them to the cochrane's boy. Amelia tried to
think she was pleased at the change. Indeed, she was happy and charmed
to see the boy looking so beautiful.
he had had a little black profile of him done for a shilling; and this
was hung up by the side of another portrait over her bed. One day the
boy came on his accustomed visit, galloping down the little street st
Brompton, and bringing, as usual, all the inhabitants to the windows to
admire his splendour, and with great eagerness, and a look of triumph in
his face, he pulled a case out of his great-coat-(it was a natty white gret-
coat, with a cape and a valet collar)-pulled on a red morocco case,
which he gave her.
I bought it with my own mone, Mamma,'' he sid. I thought
you 'd like it.''
Amelia opened the case, and giving s little or of delighted sffetian,

eizel the oy and embrace him a hundred times. It was a miniature of
himself, very pretty done (though not half handsome enough, we may be
sure, the widow thought). His grandfather had wished to have a picture
of him by an artist whose works, exhibited in a shop-window, in South-
hampton Row, had caught the old gentleman's eyes; and George, who had
plenty of money, bethought him of asking the painter how much a copy
of the little portrait would cost, saying that he would pay for it out
of his own money, and that he wanted to give it to his mother. TItle
pleased painter expected the copy for a small price; and old Osborne
himself, when he heard of the incident, growled out his satisfaction, and
gave the boy twice as many sovereigns as he paid for the miniature.
But what was the grandfather's pleasure compared to Amelia's exactly
That proof of the boy's affection charmed her so, that she thought no
child in the world was like her's for goodness. For long weeks after, the
thought of his love made her happy. She slept better with the picture
under her pillow; and how many many times did she kiss it, and weep
and pray over it A small kindness from those she led made that
timid heart grateful. Sines her parting with George she had had no
such joy and consolation.
At his new home Master George ruled like a lord: at dinner he invited
the ladies to drink wine with the utmost coolness, and took off his cham-
pine in a way which charmed his old grandfather. `Look at him,'' the
old man would say, nudging his neighbour with a delighted purple face,
`did you ever see such a half Lord, Lord l hs'lobe ordering a dressing-
case next, and razors to have with; I 'm best if lie wont,''
The antics of the law did not, however, delight. Mr. Oborne's friends
so much as they please the old gentleman. It gave Mr. Justice Coffin
no pleasure to hear Georgy cut into the conversation and spoil his stories.
Colonel Bogey was not interested in seeing the little boy half tipsy.
Mr. Serjeant Toffy's lady felt no particular gratitude when, with a twist of
his elbow, he tilted a glass of port-wine over her yellow satin, and laughed
at the disaster: nor was the better places, although old Osborne was
highly delighted, when Georgy ```wanted '' her third boy (a young gentle-
man a year older ttisn Georgy, and by chance home for the holidays from
Dr. Timeless's at ling School) in Russell Square. George's grandfather
gave the boy a cle of sovereigns fr that fit, and promised to reward
him further for every boy bove his own side and age whom he popped in
a similar mannar. It is difficult to say what good the old man s in these
combats; head a vague notionthat qurreling made boys hardy, and that
tyranny was useful accomplishment for them to learn. English youth
have been so adopted time out of mind, and we have hundreds of thou-
sands of apologists and admirers of injustice, misery, and brutality, as
perpetrated among children.
Flushed with praise and victory over Master Tony, George wished
naturally to pursue his conquests further, and one day as he was strutting
about in prodigiously dignified new clothes, near St. Pancras, and a young
baker's boy male sarcastic comments upon his appearance, the youthful
patricia pulled off his dandy jacket with great spirit, and giving it in
charge to the friend who accompanied him (Master Todd, of Great Coral

Street, Russell square, son of the junior partner of the house of Osborne and
Co.)-George tried to top the little baker. But the chances of war were
unfavourable this time, and the little baker topped Georgy: who came
home with a rueful black eye and all his fine shirt firill dabbled with the
claret drawn from his own little nose. He told his grandfather that he
had been in combat with a giant; and frightened his poor mother at
Brompton with long, and by no means authentic, accounts of the battle.
This young Todd, of Coral Street, Russell Square, was Master George's
great friend and admirer. They both had a taste for painting theatrical
characters ; for hard bake and rspbeny tarts; for sliding and skating in the
event'a Park and the Serpentine, when the weather permitted; for going
to the play, whether they were often conducted, by Mr. Osborne's orders,
by Robson, Master George's appointed body-servant; with whom they
state in great comfort in the pit.

In the company of this gentleman they visited all the principal theatres

family and their youthful friends, with Wet's famous characters, on their
skateboard theatre. Rawson, the footman, who was of a generous dis-
position, would not infrequently, when in case, treat his young master to
oysters after the play, and to a glass of rum-shrub for a night-cap. We
may be pretty certain that Mr. Robson profited in his turn, by his young
master's liherality and gratitude for the pleasures to which the footman
inducted him.
A famous tailor from the West End of the town,-Mr. Osborne would
have none of your City or Holborn bunglers he said, for the boy (though
a City tailor was good enough for him),-was summoned to ornament little
George's person, and was told to spare no expense in so doing. So, Mr.
Woolsey of Conduit-street, gave a loose to his imagination, and sent the
chill home fancy trousers, fancy waistcoats, and fancy jackets enough
to furnish a school of little dandies. Georgy hal little white wistcoats
for evening parties and little cut velvet waistcoats for dinners, and a dear
little darling shawl dressing-gown, for all the world like a little man.
He dressed for dinner every day, ``like a regular West End Well,'' as his
grandfather remarked: one of the domestic was affected to his especial
service, attended him at his toilette, answered his bell, and brought him
his letters always on a silver tray.
Georgy, after breakfast, would sit in the arm-chair in the dining-room,
and read the ` Morning Post,'' just like a grown-up man. :` How he du
dam and swear,'' the servants would cry, delighted at his precocity. Those
who remembered the Captain his father, declared Master George was his
P every inch of him. He made the house lively by his activity, lis
imperiousness, his scolding, and his good-nature.
George's education was confined to a neighbouring scholar and private
prologue who ` prepared young noblemen and gentlemen for the Univer-
cities, the senate, and the learned professions: whose system did not
embrace the degrading corporal securities, still practised at the ancient
places of education, and in whose family the pupils would find the
elegance of refined society and the confidence and affection of a home.''
It was in this way that the Reverend Lawrence Veil of Hart Street,
Bloomsbury, and domestic Chaplain to the Earl of Breaches, strove with
Mrs. eal his wife to entice pupils.
By thus advertising and pushing sedulously, the domestic Chaplain and
his Lady generally succeeded in having one or two scholars by them: who
paid a high figure: and were thought to be in uncommonly comfortable
quarters. There was a large West Indian, whom nobody came to see,
with a mahogany complexion, a woolly he, and an exceedingly dignified
appearance: there was another hulking boy of three-and-twenty whose
education had been neglected, and whom Mr. and Mrs. Veal were
to introduce into the polite world: there were two sons of Colonel
Bangles of the East India Company's Service : these four sate down to
dinner at Mrs. Veal's genteel board, when Georgy was introduced to her
establishment.
Georgy was, like some doren other pupils, only a day boy: he arrived
in the morning under the guardianship of his friend Mr, Rowan, and if it

was fine, would ride away in the afternoon on his pony, followed by the
groom. The wealth of his grandfather was reported in the school to be
prodigious. The Re. Mr. Veal used to compliment Georgy upon it
personally, warning him that he was destined for a high station; that it
became him to prepare, by security and docility in youth, for the lofty
duties to which he would be called in mature age; that obedience in the
child was the best preparation for command in the man; and that he
therefore begged George would not bring toffy into the school, and ruin
the health of the Masters Bangles, who had everything they wanted at the
elegant and abundant table of Mrs. Veal.
With respect to learning, `' the Curriculum,'' as Mr. Veal loved to call
it, was of prodigious extent: and the young gentlemen in Hart Street
might learn a something of every known science. The Rey. Mr. Veal had
an orrery, an electrifying machine, a turning lathe, a theatre (in the wash-
house), a chemical apparatus, and, what he called a select library of all the
works of the best authors of ancient and modern times and languages.
lIe took the boys to the British Museum, and descended upon the antique-
ties and the specimens of natural history there, so that audiences would
gather round him as he spoke, and all Bloomsbury highly admired him as
a prodigiously well informed man. And whenever he spoke (which he did
almost always), he took care to produce the very finest and longest words
of which the vocabulary gave him the use; rightly judging, that it was as
cheap to employ a handsome, large, and enormous epithet, as to use a little
tiny one.
Thus he would say to George in school, '`I observed on my return home
from taking the indulgence of an evening's scientific conversation with my
excellent friend Doctor Builders-a true areheologian, gentlemen, a true
archaeological-that the windows of your venerated grandfather's almost
princely mansion in Russell square were illuminated as if for the purposes
of festivity. Am lI right in my conjecture, that Mr. Osborne entertained a
society of chosen spirits round his sumptuous board last night ''
Little Georgy, who had considerable humour, and used to mimic Mr,
Veal to his face with great spirit and dexterity, would reply, that Mr, .
was quite correct in his surmise.
hen those friends who had the honor of partaking of MIr. Osborne's
hospitality, gentlemen, had no reason, I will lay any wager, to complain
of their repast. I myself have been more than once so favoured. (By the
way, Master Osborne, you came a little late this morning, and have been
a defaulted in this respect more than one). I myself, I say, gentlemen,
humble as i am, have been found not unworthy to share Mr. Osborne's
elegant hospitality. And though I have feasted with the great and noble
of the world-for I presume that I may call my excellent friend and patron,
the Right Honourable George Earl of Breweries, as one of the number-yet
I assure you that the board of the British merchant was to the full ass
richly served, and his reception as gratifying and noble. Mr. Black,
Sir, we will resume, if you please, that passage of Eutropius, which was
interrupted by the late arrival of Master Osborne.'''
To this great man George's education was for some time entrusted.

Amelia was bewildered by his phrases, but thought him a prodigy of
learning. `That poor widow made friends with Mr. Vocal, for reasons of
her own. She liked to be in the house, and see Georgy coming to school
there. sHe liked to he asked to Mre. Veal'as cosersaeioni, which took
place once a month (as you were informed on pink cards, with TaKEN
engraved on them), and where the Professor welcomed his pupils and their
friends to weak tea and scientific conversation. Poor little Aelia never
missed one of these entertainments, and thought them delicious so long as
she might have Georgy sitting y her. And she would walk from bBromptou
in any weather, and embrace Mrs. Goal with tearful gratitude for the
delightful evening she had passed, when, the company having retired and
Georgy gone off with MIr. Robson his attendant, poor krs. Osborne put
on her clocks and her ahawls preparatory to walking home.
As for the damning which Georgy imbibed under this voluble master of
a hundred machines, to judge from the weekly reports which the lad took
home to his grandfather, his progress was remarkable. The names of a
store or more of desirable branches of knowledge were printed on a table,
and the pupil's progress in each was marked by the professor. In Greek
Georgy was pronounced aristos, in Latin optimum, in FRench tres in,
and so forth; and everybody had prizes for everything at the end of the
year. Even Mr. waltz, the woolly-headed young gentleman, and half-
brother to the Honourable Mrs. Mc Mull, and Mr. Block, the neglected
young pupil of thirteen-twenty from the agricultural districts, and that
idle young seapegraoe of a Master Todd before mentioned, received little
eighteen-penny hooks, with '' Athene'' engraved in them, and a pompous
Latin inscription from the Professor to his young friends.
The family of this Master Todd were hangers-on of the house of
Oborne. The old gentleman had advanced Todd from being a clerk to
be a junior partner in his establishment.
Mr. Osborne was the godfather of young aster Todd (who in subset-
quest life wrote Mr. Obomne Todd on his cards, and became a man of
decided fashion) while Miss Osborne had accompanied Miss Maria Todd
to the front, and gave her proetegee a prayer-book, a collection of trusts, a
volume of very low church poetry, or some such memento of her goodness
every year. Miss O. drove the Odds out in her carriage now and then:
when they were all her footman, in large plush smalls and waiateoat,
brought jellies and delicacies from Russell Square to Coral Street. Coral
Street trembled and looked up to sell Square indeed; and Mrs. Todd,
who had a pretty hand at cutting out paper trimings for haunches of
mutton, and could make flowers, ducks, &c., out of turnips and carrots in
a very creditable manner, would go to ``the Square,'' as it was called, and
aasiat in the preparations incident to a great dinner, without even so much
as thinking of sitting down to the banquet. If any guest failed at the
eleventh hour, Todd was asked to dine. Mrs. Todd and Maria same across
in the evening, slipped in with a muffled knock, and were in the drawing-
robin by the time Miss Osborne and the ladies under her convoy reached
that apartment; and ready to fire off lets and sing until the gentlemen
came up. Poor Maria Todd; poor young lady How she had to work

Thus it seemed to be decreed by fate, that Georgy was to domineer over
everybody with whom he came in contact, and that friends, relatives, and
domestic were all to bow the knee before the little fellow. It must be
owned that he accommodated himself very willingly to this arrangement.
Most people do so. And Georgy liked to play the part of master, and
perhaps had a natural aptitude for it.
In Russell Square everybody ws afraid of M. Osborne, and Mr. Osborne
was afraid of Georgy. The boy's dashing manners, and off-hand rattle
about books and learning, his likeness to his father, (dead reconciled in
Brussels yonder), awed the old gentleman, and give the young boy the
mastery. The old man would start at some hereditary feature or tone
consciously used by the little lad, and fancy that George's father was
again before him. He tried by indulgence to the grandson to make up for
harshness to the elder George. People were surprised at his gentleness to
these He agreed and uses at Niss Home as usul : and would
smile when George came down late for breakfast.
Miss Osborne, George's aunt, was a faded old spinster, broken down
by more than forty years of dullness and coarse usage. It was easy for a
law of spirit to master her. And whenever George wanted anything from
her, from the jam-pots in her cupboards, to the cracked and dry old colours
in her paint-box (the old paint-box which she had had when she was a
pupil of Mr. Smee, and was still almost young and blooming), Georgy
took possession of the object of his desire, which obtained, he took no
further notice of his aunt.
For his friends and cronies, he had a pompous old schoolmaster, who
mattered him, and a today, his senior, whom he could thrash. It was
denr Mrs. Todd's delight to leave him with her youngest daughter, Ross
Jemima, a darling child of eight years old. The little pir looked so
well together, she would say (but not to the folks in 'the Square,' we
may be sure),- Who knows what might happen Don't they make a
pretty little couple'' the fond mother thought.
The broken-spirited, old, maternal grandfather was likewise subject to
the little tyrant. He could not help respecting a lad who had such fine
clothes, and rode with a groom behind him. Georgy, on his side, was in
the constant habit of hearing course abuse and vulgar satire levied at
John Sedley, by his pitiless old enemy, Mr. Osborne. Osborne used to
call the other the old pauper, the old coal-man, the old bankrupt, and by
many other such names of brutal contumely. How was little George to
respect a man so prostrate  few months after he was with his paternal
grandfather, Mrs. Sedley died. There had been little love between her and
the child. He did not care to show much grief. He came down to visit
his mother in a fine new suit of mourning, and was very angry that he
could not go to a play upon which he had set his heart.
The illness of that old lady had been the occupation and perhaps the
safeguard of Anelik. Why do men know about women's martyrdom?

pains which are meekly borne by many women, Ceaseless slavery meeting
with no reward; constant gentleness and kindness met by cruelty as con-
stant; love, labour, patience, watchfulness, without even so much as the
acknowledgment of a good word; all this, how many of them have to
bear in quiet, and appear abroad with cheerful faces as if they felt
nothing. Tender slaves that they are, they must needs be hypocrites and
wek.
From her chair Amelia's mother had taken to her bed, which she had
never left: and from which Mrs. Osborne herself was never absent except
when she in to see George. The old lady grudge her even those rare
visits: she, who had been a kind, smiling, good-natured mother once,
in the days of her prosperity, but whom poverty and infirmities had
broken down. Her illness or estrangement did not affect Amelia. They
rather enabled her to support the other mentality under which she was sun-
firing, and from the thoughts of which she was kept by the ceaseless calle
of the invalid. Amelia bore her harshness quite gently: smoothed the
uneasy pillow; was always ready with a soft answer to the watchful, query-
loss voice; soothed the sufferer with words of hope, such as her pious
simple heart could best feel and utter, and closed the eyes that had once
looked so tenderly upon her.
Then all her time and tenderness were devoted to the consolation and
comfort of the bereaved old father, who was stunned by the blow which
had befallen him, and took utterly alone in the world. His wife, his
honour, his fortune, everything he loved best had fallen away from him.
There was only Amelia to stand by and support with her gentle arms the
tottering, heart-broken, old man. We are not going to write the history:
it would be too dreary and stupid. I can see Vanity Fair yawning oer
it: d'balance.
One day as the young gentlemen were assembled in the study at the
Rev. Mr. Vel's, and the domestic chaplain to the Right Honourable the
Earl of Barencres was spouting away as usual-a smart carriage drove
up to the door decorated with the statue of Athens, and two gentlemen
stepped ont. The yung Masters Bangles rushed to the window, with a
vague notion that their father might have arrived from Bombay. The
great hulking scholar of three-and-twenty, who was crying secretly over a
passage of Eutropius, flattened his neglected nose against the panes, and
looked at the drag, as the aguais de place sprang from the box and let out
the persons in the carriage.
It 's as fat one and a thin one,'' Mr. Black said, as a thundering knock
came to the door.
Everybody was interested, from the domestic chaplain himself, who
hoped he saw the fathers of some future pupils, down to Master Georgy,
glad of any pretext for lying lis book down.
The boy in the shabby livery, with the faded copper-buttons, who
always thrust himself into the tight coat to open the door, came into the
study and said,  Two gentlemen want to see Master Osborne.'' Th

T was one of the many causes for
personal pride with which ol
Osborne chose to recreate himself,
that Sedley, his ancient rival, enemy,
and benefactors, was in his last
days as utterly defeated and in-
diluted, as to be forced to accept
pecuniary obligations at the hands
of the man who had most injured
and insulted him. The successful
man of the world cursed the old
pepper, and relieved him from time
to time. As he furnished George
with money for his mother, he gave
the boy to understand by hints,
delivered in his brutal, coarse way,
that George's maternal grandfather
was but a weather old bankrupt
and dependent, and that John Sed-
ley might thank the man to whom
he already owed ever so much
money, for the aid which his gene-
rosity now chose to administer.
George carried the pompous supplies to his mother and the shattered
old widower whom it was now the main business of her life to tend and
comfort. The little fellow patronised the feeble and disappointed old man.
It may have shown a want of `' proper price'' in Amelia that she
chose to accept these money benefits at the hands of her father's enemy.
But proper pride and this poor lady had never had much aequaiutancee
together. A disposition naturally simple and demanding protection; a
long course of poverty and. humility, otf daily privations, and hard words,
of kind offices and no returns, had been her lot ever since womanhool
almost, or since her reckless marriage with George Osborne. You who
see your betters, bearing up under this shame every day, meekly suffering
under the lights of fortune, gentle and united, poor, and rather despised
for their poverty, do you eer step down from your prosperity and was

odious and now.  There must he classes-there must be rich and poor,''
Dives says, smacking his claret- (it is well if he even sends the broken meat
out to Lazarus sitting under the window.) Very true; but think how
mysterious and often unnccountable it is-that lottery of life which gives
to this man the purple and fine linen, and sends to the other rags for
garments and dogs for comforts.
So I must own, tent without much refining, on the contrary with some-
thing akin to gratitude, Amelia took the crumbs that her father-in-law let
drop now and then and with the fed her own parent. Directly she
understood it to be her duty, it was this young woman's nature (ladies, she
is but thirty still, and we choose to call her a young woman even at that
age)-it was, I by, her nature to sacrifice herself and to fling all that she
mat at the feet of the beloved object. During what long thankless nights
lad she worked out her fingers for little Georgy whilst ut hoe with her;
what buffets, scores, privations, properties had she endured for father aud
mother And in the midst of all these solitary resignations und unseen
sacrifices, she did not respect herself any more than the world respected
her; but I believe thought in her heart that she was a poor-spirited,
despicable little creature, whose luck in life was only too good for her
merits. O you poor women OF you poor secret martyrs and victims,
whose life is a torture, who are stretched on racks in your bedrooms, and
who lay your heads down on the block daily at the drawing-room tall
every an who watches your pains, or peers into those dark places where
the torture is administered to you, must pity you-and-and thank God
that he has a beard. I recollcct seeing, years ago, at the prison for idiots

bondage of his imprisonment and his personal infirmity, to whom one of

The kindness was too much for the poor epileptic creature. HIe cried
in an anguish of delight and gratitude: if anybody gave you and me a

if you properly tyranunise over a woman, you will find a half 'orth of
kindness act upon her, and bring tears into her eyes, as though you were
an angel benefiting her.
Some such boons as these were the best which Fortune allotted to poor
little Amelia. Her life, begun not unprosperously, had come down to
this-to a mean prison and a long, ignoble bondage. Little George
visited her captivity sometimes, and consoled it with feeble gleams of
encouragement. russell Square was the boundary of her prison: slc
might walk thither occasionally, but was always back to sleep in her cell
at night; to perform cheerlcss duties ; to watch by thnnkless sick-beds;
to suffer the harassment and tyranny of querulous disappointed old age.

just such a rainy, dark day, as Amelia recollected when first she had been
there to marry George. Her little boy sate by her side in pompous new
sables. She remembered the old pew-woman and clerk. Her thoughts
were away in other times as the person read. But that she held George's
hand in her own, perhaps she would have liked to change places with..
Then, as usual, she felt ashamed of her selfish thoughts, and prayed
inwardly to be strengthened to to her duty.
So she determined with all her might and strength to try and make her
old father happy. Enslaved, toiled, patched and mended, sang and played
backgammon, rend out the newspaper, cooked dishes for old Sedley,
walked him out sedulously into kensington Gardens or the Brompton
Lanes, listened to his stories with uniting smiles and affectionate
hypocrisy, or sate musing by lis side and communing with her own
thoughts and reminiscences, as the old man, feeble and querulous, stunned
himself on the garden benches and rattled about his wrongs or his
sorrows. Who sad, unsatisfactory thoughts those of the widow were
The children running up and down the slopes and broad paths in the
gardens, reminded her of George who was taken from her; the first
George was taken from her: her selfish, guilty love, in both instances,
had been rebuke and bitterly chastised. She strove to think it was right
that she should be so punished. She was sucli a miserable wicked sinner.
She was quite alone in the world.
I know that the account of this kind of solitary imprisonment is
insufferably tedious, unless there is some cheerful or humorous incident
to enliven it,-a tender gabler, for instance, or a haggis commandant of
the fortress, or a mouse to come out and play about Laude's bear and
whiskers, or n subterranean passage under the castle, dug by Trench with
his nails and a toothpick: the historian has no such enlivening incident
to relate in the narrative of Amelia's captivity. Fancy ler, if you please,
during this period, very sad, but always ready to smile when spoken to; in
a very mean, poor, not to say vulgar position of life; singing songs, making
puddings, playing cards, mending stockings, for her old father's benefit.
Bo, never find, whether she be a heroine or no; or you and I, however
old, sceolding, anl bankrupt;-may we have in our last days a kind soft
shoulder on which to lean, and a gentle hand to soothe our gout old
pillows.
Oll Selley grew very fond of his daughter after his wife's death; and
Amelia had her consolation in doing her duty by the old man.
But we are not going to leave these two people long in such a low and
ungenteel station of life. etter days, as far as worldly prosperity went,
were in store for both. Perhaps the ingenious reader has guessed who

with our old friend Major Dobbin. It was another old acquaintance
returned to England, and at a time when his presence was likely to be of
great comfort to his relatives there.
Major Dobbin having easily succeeded in getting leave from his good-
natured commandant to proceed to Madras, and thence probably to Europe,
on urgent private affairs, neer ceased travelling night and day until he
reached his journey's end, and had directed his march with such celebrity,
that he arrived at Madras in a high fever. His servants who accompanied
him, brought him to the house of the friend with whom he had resolved to
stay until his departure for Europe in a state of delirium; and it was
thought for many many days that he would never travel further than the
burying-ground of the church of St. George's, where the troops should
fire n salvo over his grave, and where many a gallant officer lies far away
from his home.
Here is the poor fellow lay tossing in his fever, the people who watched
him might have heard him raving about Amelia. The idea that he should
never see ler again depressed him in his lucid hours. Ie thought his
last day was come; and he made his solemn preparations for departure:
setting his affairs in this world in order, and leaving the little property of
which he was possessed to those whom he most desired to benefit. The
friend in whose house he was located witnessed his testament. le desire
to be buried with a little brown hair-chain which he wore round his neck,
and which, if the truly must be known, he had got from Amelia's maid at
Brussels, when the young widow's hair was cut off, during the fever which
prostrated her after the death of George Osborne on the plateau of Mount
St. Jolmn.
He recovered, rallied, relapsed again, having undergone such a process
of blood-letting and closely as showed the strength of his original const-
tuition. IIe was almost a skeleton when they put him on board the
Rnmchunder, lEast Indiana, Captain Bragg, from Calcutta touching at
INdians; and so weak and prostrate, that his friend who had tended him
through his illness, prophesied that the honest Major would never survive
the voyage, and that he would pass some morning, shrouded in flag and
hamock, over the ship's side, and carrying down to the sea with him,
the relic that he wore at his heart. lut whether it was the sea air, or
the hope which sprang up in im afresh, from the day that the ship spread
her canvass and stood out of the ronds towards ome, our friend began
to mend, and he was quite well (though as gaunt is a greyhound) before
they reuchel the Cape. `` Kirk will be disappointed of' his majority
this time,'' he said with a smile ``he will expect to find himself gazetted
by the time the regiment reaches lome.'' For it must be pressed
the while the Major was lying ill at Madras, having made such a
prodigious haste to go thither, the gallant -th which had passed many
years nbrond, which after its return from the West Indies lad been balked
of its stay at home by the Waterloo campaign, and had been ordered
from Flanders to India, and received orders home; and the Major might
have accompanied his comrades, had he chosen to wait for their arrival
at Madras.
PErhaps he was not inclined to put himself in his exhausted state again

under the guardianship of Gloving. : I think Miss O'Dowd would have
done for me,'' he said, langhingly, to a fellow-passenger, ` if we and had
her on board, and when she had sunk me, she would have fallen upon you,
depend upon it, and carried you in as a prize to Southampton, Jos, my
boy.''
For indeed it was no other than our stout friend who was also a pns-
senger on board the Ramchunder. He had passed ten years in Bengal.-
Constant dinners, tiffins, pale ale and claret, the prodigious labours of
cutcherry, and the refreshment of brandy-pawnee which he was forced to
take there, had their effect upon Waterloo Sedley. A voyage to Europe
was pronounced necessary for him-nd having served his full time in
India, and had fine appointments which had enabled him to play by a con-
desirable sum of money, he was free to come home and stay with a good
pension, or to return and resume that rank in his service to which his
seniority and his vast talents entitled him.
He was rather thinner than when we last saw him, but had gained in
majesty and solemnity of demennour. He and resumed the moustnchios
to which his services at Waterloo entitled him, and staggered about on
deck in a magnificent velvet cap with a gold and, and a profuse rna-
mentation of pins and jewellery about his person. IIe took breakfast in
his cabin, and dressed as solemnly to appear on the quarter-deck, as if he
was going to turn out for Bond Street, or the Course at Calcutta. He
brought a native servant with him, who was his valet and pipe-bearer;
and who were the Sedley rest in silver on his turban. That oriental
menial had a wretched life under the tyranny of Jos Sedley. Jos was as
vain of his person as a woman, and took as long a time at his toilette as
any fading beauty. The youngsters among the passengers, oung Chaffers
of the 150th, and poor little ricketts, coming home after his third fever,
used to draw out Sedley at the cuddy-table, and make him tell prodigious
stories about himself nnl his exploits against tigers and Napoleon. He
was great when he visited the Emperor's tomb at Longwood, when to these
gentlemen and the young officers of the ship, Major Dobbin not being by, he
described the whole Battle of Waterloo, and all but announced that Napo-
leon never would have gone to Saint HElena at all but for him, Jos Sedley.
After leaving St. Helena he became very generous, disposing of a great
quantity of ship stores, claret, preserved meats, and great casks packed
with soda-water, brought out for his private delectation. There were no
ladies on board; the Major give the pas of precedence to the civilian,
so that he was the first dignity at table; and treated by Captain
Bragg, and the officers of the Ramchunler, with the respect which his
rank warranted. IIe disappeared rather in a panic during a two-days'
gale, in which he had the portholes of his cabin battered down; and
remained in his cot reading the Washerwoman of Finally Common, left
on board the Ramchunder by the Right Honourable the Lady Emily
Horblower, wife of the Re. Silas Hornblower, then on their passage out
to the Cape, where the Reverend gentleman was a missionary ; but, for
common reading, he had brought a stock of novels and plays which he
went to the rest of the ship, and rendered himself agreeable to all by
his kindness and condescension.

In these conversations it was wonderful with what perseverance and
ingenuity Major Dobbin would usage to bring the talk round to the
subject of Amelia and her little boy. Jos, a little testy about his father'
misfortunes and unceremonious applications to him, was soothed down by
the Major, who pointed out the elder's ill fortunes and old age. He
would not perhaps like to live with the old couple: whose ways and
hours might not agree with those of a younger man, accustomed to different

society, (Jos bowed and this compliment) : but, the Major pointed out, how
advantageous it would be for Jos Sedley to have a house of his own in
London, and not a mere bachelor's establishment as before; how his sister
Amelia would be the very person to preside over it; how elegant, how
gentle she was, and of what refined good manners. He recounted stories
of the success which Mrs. George Osborne had had in former days at
Brussels, and in London, where she was much admired by people of very
great fashion: and he then hinted how becoming it would be for Jos to
send Georgy to a good school and make a man of him; for his mother
and her parents would be sure to spoil him. In a word this artful Major
made the civilian promise to take charge of Amelia and her unprotected
child. He did not know as yet what events had happened in the little
Selley family; and how death had removed the mother, and riches had
carried off George from Amelia. But the fact is that every day and
always, this love-smitten and middle-aged gentleman was thinking about
Mrs. Osborne, and his whole heart was bent upon doing her good. He
coaxed, wheeled, cnjoled, nd complimented Jos 5edley with a persever-
once and cordiality of which he was not aware himself, very likely : but
some men who have unmarried sisters or daughters even, may remember
how uncominonly agreeable gentlemen are to the male relations when they
are courting the females; and perhaps this rogue of n Dobbin was urged
by a similar hypocrisy.
The truth is, when Major Dohbin cme on board the Ramchunder,
very sick, and for the three days she lay in the MAdras Roads, he did not
begin to rally, nor did even the appearance and recognition of his old
acquaintance, MIr. Sedlcy, on board such cheer him, until after a corner-
station which they had one day, as the Major was laid lnguidly on the
deck. He said then he thought he was doomed; he had left a little
something to his godson in his will; and he trusted Mrs. Osborne would
remember him kindly, and be happy in the marriage she was about to
make. ` Married not the least,'' Jos answered; `' he had heard From
her; she made no mention of the marriage, and by the way, it was curious,
she wrote to say that MAjor Dobbin was going to be married, and hoped
that he would be happy,'' What were the dates of Sedley's letters from
Europe: 1he civilian fetched them. they were two months' later than
the Major's; and the ship's surgeon congratulated himself upon the treat-
ment adopted by him towards his new patient, who had been consigned
to ship-board by the Madras practitioner with very small hopes indeed;
for, from the day, the very day that he changed the draught, Major bobbin
began to mend. And thus it was that deserving officer, Captain Nick,
was disappointed of his majority.

amiable, that even Captain bragg, who thought there was nothing in his

But s calm taking place when the Ramchandra was within ten days' sail

excited state when the pilot came on board. Good God, how his heart

UR Major had rendered himself
so popular on board the Ram-
chuuder, that when he and Mr.
Sedley descended into the welcome
shore-boat which was to take them
from the ship, the whole crew,
men and officers, the great Cap-
tain bragg himself leading off,
gave three cheers for MAjor Dob-
bin, who brushed very much, and
ducked his head in token of thanks.
Jos who very likely thought the
cheers were for himself, took off
his goal-laced cap and wave it
najestically to his friends, and
they were pulled to shore and
filled with great dignity at the
pier, whence they proceeded to the
ROyal George hotel.
Although the sight of that
magnificent round of beef, and the
silver tankard suggestive of real
British home - brewed ale and
porter,whichperennially greet the
eyes of the traveller returning from foreign parts, who enters the coffee-
room of the George, are aso invigorating and delightful, that a man enter-
in such a comfortable snug homely English inn, might well like to stop
some days there, yet Dobbin began to talk about a post-chaise instantly,
and was no sooner at Southampton than he wished to be on the road to
London. Jos, however, would not hear of moving that evening. Why
was he to pass night in a post-chaise instead of a great large undulating
downy feathered which was there ready to replace the horrid littlenarrow
crib in which the portly Bengal gentleman had been confined during the
voyage? He could not think of moving till his baggage was cleared, or
of travelling until he could do so with his chillum. So the Major was
forced to wait over that night, and dispatched a letter to his family an-
mourning his arrival; retreating from Jos a promise to write to his own

friends. Jos promise, but didn't keep his promise. The Captain, the
surgeon, and one or two passengers came and dined with our two gentle-
men at the inn: Jos exerting himself in a sumptuous way in ordering
the winner: and promising to go to town the next day with the Major.
The landlord said it did his eyes good to see Mr. Sedley take off his first
point of porter. If I had time and dared to enter into digressions, I would
write a chapter about that first pint of porter drunk upon English ground.
Ah, how good it is It is worth while to leave home for a year, just to
enjoy that one draught.
MAjor Dobbin made his appearance the next morning very neatly shaved
and dressed, according to his wont. Indeed, it was so early in the
morning, that nobody was up in the house except that wonderful Boots of
an inn who never seems to want sleep: and the Major could hear the
scores of the various inmates of the house roaring through the corridors
as he created about in those dim passages. Then the sleepless bOots
went shirking round from door to door, gathering up at each the Launches,
Wellington, Oxonians, which stood outside. Then Jos's native servant
rose and began to get ready his master's ponderous dressing apparatus,
and prepare his ookah: then the maid servants got up, and meeting the
dark man in the passages shrivel and mistook him for the deal. IIe
and bObbin stumbled over their pairs in the passages as they were
scouring the weeks of the Royal George. When the first unshormn waiter
appeared and unmarried the door of the in, the Major thought that the
time for departure was arrived, and ordered s post-chaise to be fetched
instantly, that they might set off.
IIe then directed his steps to MIr. Sedley's room, and opened the
curtains of the great large family bed wherein Mr. Jos was snoring. `Come,
up: Sedley,'' the Major said, ' it's time to be off'; the clause will be at
tie door in half an hour.''
Jos growled from under the counterpart to know what the time was;
but when he at last extorted from the blushing Major (who never told fits,
however much they might be to his advantage) what was the real hour of
the morning, he broke out into a volley of bad language, which we will
not repeat here, but by which he gave Dobbin to understand that he
would jeopardy his soul if he got up at that moment, that the Major
might go and bc hanged, that he would not travel with Dobbin, and tlt
it was most unkind and ungentlemanlike to disturb a man out of his sleep
in that way: on which the discomfited Major was obliged to retreat,
leaving Jos to resume his interrupted slumbers.
1he chaise came up presently, and the Major would wait no longer.
If he had been an English nobleman travelling on a pleasure tour; ora
newspaper courier, bearing dispatches, (government messages are generally
carried much more quietly) he could not have travelled more quickly. The
post boys wondered at the feces he flung amongst them. Low happy
and green the country looked and the chaise wlirled rapidly from mile-
stone to mile-stone, through neat country towns where Landlords came
out to welcome him with smiles and bows; by pretty rod-side inns,
where the signs hung on the elms, and horses and waggoners were
drinking under the chequered shadow of the trees; by old hills and

le grudge the time lost between Piecalilly and his old haunt at the
Slaughter's, whither he drove faithfully. Long years had passed since ho
nw it last, since he and George, as young men, had enjoyed many a feast,
and held many a revel there. He had now passed into the stage of all-
fellows-hool. His hair was grizzled, and many a passion and feeling of
his youth had grown grey in that interval. There, however, stood the old
water at the door in the same greasy black suit, with the use double clin
and flaccid face, with the same huge bunch of seals at his fob, rattling his
money in his pockets us before, and receiving the Major as if he had gone
away only a week ago. ` Put the Major's things in twenty-three, that's
his room,'' John said, exhibiting not the least surprise. ` almost town for

every officer who used the house, and with whom ten years were but as
yesterday, led the way up to Dobbin's old room, where stood the great
moreno bed, and the shabby carpet, u thought more dingy, and all the old
black furniture covered with faded clint, just as the Major recollected
them in his youth.
He remembered George pacing up and down the room, and biting his
nails, and swearing that the Governor must come round, and that if he
lion't, he lin't care a straw, on the day before he was married. lIe could
fancy him walking in, banging the door of bohbin's room, and his own

John of the Slaughter's pulled out the very morocco pocket-book in which
he had noted his loan to the Captain, upon a grassy fall page still extent,

as he surveyed them in the dreary little toilet-glass on the dressing
table.

too, I hope.'' And he sallied out of the inn, bending his steps once more
in the direction of Brompton,
Every minute incident of his last meeting with Amelia was present to
the constant man's mind as he walked towards her house. The arch and
the Achilles statue were up since he had last been in Piccadilly; a hundred
changes had occurred which his eye and mind vaguely noted. He began
to tremble as he walked up the lane from Brompton, that well remembered
lane lending to the street where she lived. Wass she going to be married
or not ? If he were to meet her with the little boy-Good God, what
should he do% He saw a woman coming to him with a child of five years
old-was that she IIe began to slake at the mere possibility. When
he came up to the row of houses, at last, where she lived, and to the gate,
he caught hold of it and paused. He might have heard the thumping of
his own heart. `'May God Almighty bless her, whatever has happened,''
he thought to himself. Pshal she may be gone from here,'' he said,
and went in through the gate.
The window of the parlour which she used to occupy was open,
and there were no inmates in the room. The Major thought he
recognised the piano though, with the picture over it, as it used to be
in former days, and his perturbations were renewed. Mr. Clapp's brass
plate was still on the door; at the knocker of which Dohbin performed a

had already been surveying the Major from the casement of the ornamental
kitchen, and were astonished to find their daughter in the little passage in
the embrace of a great tall man in a blue froek coat and white duck
browsers.

The landlord and landlady of the house led the worthy North into the
Bedleys' room (whereof he remembered every single article of furniture,
from the old brass ornamented piano, once a atty little instrument, Sto-
third maker, to the screen and the alabaster miniature-tombstone, in the
midst of which ticked Mr. Sedley's gold watch), and there as he sat down
in the lodger's vacant arm-chair, the father, the mother, and the daughter,
with a thousand ejaculatory breaks in the narrative, informed Major Dobbin
of what we know already, but of particulars in Amelia's history of which
he was not aware-namely, of Mrs. Sedley's death, of George's reconcile-
ment with his grandfather Osborne, of the way in which the widow took
on at leaving him, and of other particulars of her life. Twice or thrice
he was going to ask about the marriage-portion, but his heart failed him.
He did not care to lay it are to these people. Finally, e was informed
that Mrs. O. was gone to walk with her Pa iu Kensington Gardens,
whither she always went with the old gentleman (who was very weak and
peevish now, and led her a s life, though she behaved to him like an
angel, to be sure,) of a fine afternoon after dinner.
i 'm very much pressed for time,'' the major said, `' and have business
to-night of importance. I should like to see Mrs. Osborne tho'. Suppose
Miss Polly would come with me and show me the way.''
Miss Polly was charmed and a-finish at this proposal. `` She knew
the way. She would show mAjor ollie. she had often been with MIr.
Sedley when MIrs. O, was gone-was gone Russell SQuare way: and knew
the bench where he liked to sit.'' She bounced away to herapartment,
and appeared presently in her best bonet nd her mama's yellow shawl
and large pebble broocl, of which slc asset the loan in order to make
herself a worthy companion for the Major.,
That officer, then in his blue frock-co:t and buckslin gloves, give the
young ldy his car, and they walked away very gaily.. IIe ws glad to
have a friend at hand for the scene which he dreaded somehow. He asked
a thousand more questions from his companion about Amelia : his kind
heart grieved to think that she should havehl to it with her son.
How did sle beer it: Did she see him oltn: Wu Mr. Sedley pretty
comfortable now in n worldly point of view Toll answered all these
questions of Major Sugnrplums to the very best of her power.
And in the midst their walk an incident occurred which, though very
simple in its nature, was productive of the greatest delight to MAjor bobbin.
A pale young man with feeble whiskers and stiff white neckeloth came

One was a tall and commanding middle-aged female, ith features and a
completion similar to those of the clergyman the Chapel of England by
whose side she arched, and the other a stunted little womb with a dark
face, ornamented by a fine new bonnet and white ribbons, and in a smart
ellipse with a rich gold watch in the midst of her person. the gentleman,
opinion as he was by these two ladies, carried further a parasol, shawl,
and basket, so that his arms were entirely engaged, and of course he was
unable to touch his hat in acknowledgment of the curtsey with which Miss
Mary Olapp greeted him.
He meekly bowed his head in reply to her salutation, which the two

lnlies returned in a patronising air, and at the same time looking severely
at the individual in the blue coat and bamboo cane, who accompanied
Miss Polly.
 WHo's that,'' asked the Major, amused by the group, and after he had
made way for the three to pass up the lane. MAry looked at him rather
roguishly.
e That is one curate, the Reverend Mr. Binney, (a twitch from Major
obbin), and his sister Miss B. Lord bless us, how she did use to worret
us ut Sunday-school; nd the other lady, the little one with a cut in her
eye, and the handsome watch, is MIrs. Binney-Miss Grits that was; her
A was a grocer, and kept the Little Original Gold Tin Pot in Kensington
Gravel Pite. They were married last month, and are just come back from
Margate. She's five thousand pound to her fortune; but her and Miss B.,
who de the match, have quarrelled already,''
If the MInor had twitched before, he started now, and slapped the
Book on the ground with an emphasis which made Miss Clapp cry,
`In,'' and laugh too. lIe stool for a moment silent with open mouth
looking after the retreating young couple, while Miss Mary told their history;
ht he did not her beyond the announcement of the reverend gentleman's
marriage; his heal was swimming with felicity. After this encounter he
began to walk double quick towards the place of his destination; and
yet they were too soon (for he was in a great tremor at the idea of a
meeting for which he had been longing any time these ten years)-through
the bRompton lanes, and entering at the little old portal in Kensington
Garden wall.
 There they are,'' said Miss Polly,'' and she felt him again start back
on her arm. She was a confidante nt one of the whole business. She
knew the story as well as if she had read it in one of her favourite noel-
books-` Fatherless Fanny,'' or the `` Scottish Chiefs.''
Suppose you were to run on and tell her,'' the Major said. Polly rn
forward, her yellow shawl streaming in the breeze.
Old Selley was seated on a bench, his handkerchief placed over his
knees, rattling away according to his wont, with some old story about
old times, to which Amnesia had listened, and awarded a patient smile
many a time before. Sle could of late think of her own affairs, and smile
or make other marks of recognition of her father's stories, without scarce
hearing a word of the old man's tales. As Mnr came bouncing along,
and Amelia caught sight of her, she started up from her bench. HIer first
thought was, that something had happened :o Georgy; but the sight of
the messenger's eager and happy face dissipated that- fear in the timorous
nother's bosom.
 Now News:'' cried the emissary of Major Dobbin. e To'a
con He's come
WYIo is come:'' said Emmy, still thinking of her son.
 Look there,'' answered Miss Clapp, turning round and pointing; in
which direction Amelia looking, saw Dobbin's lean figure and long shadow
stalking across the grass. Amelia started in her turn, brushed up, and,
of course, ban to cry. At all this simple little creature's Ites, tha
grandes eau were accustomed to play.

IIe looked at her-oh, how fondly-as she came running towards him,
her hands before her, ready to give them to him. She was'nt called.
She was a little pale: a little stouter in figure. Her eyes were the same,
the kind trustful eyes. There were scarce three lines of silver in her soft
brown hair. She gave lim both her hands as she looked up flushing and
smiling through her tears into his honest homely ace. He took the two
little hands between his two, and held them there. He was speechless
for a moment. Why did he not take her in his arms, and shown that he
would never leave her? She must have yielded: she could not but have
obeyed him.
 I-I1've another arrival to announce,'' he said, after a pause.
 Mre. Dobbin '' Anglia said, making a movement baek-Why didn't
he speak
 No,'' he said, letting her hands go: : Who has told you those lies:
-I mean, your brother Jos came in the same slip with me, and is come
home to make you nll happy.''
 Pape, papa1'' Emmy cried out, `'here are news My brother is in
England. He is come to take care of you.-ller is Major Dobbin.''
Mr. Sedley started up, slaking a great deal, and gathering up his
thoughts. 1hen hc stepped forward and made an old-fashioned low to
the Major, whom he called Mlr. Dobbin, and hopes his worthy father, Sir
William, was quite well. lIle proposed to call upon Sir William, who had
done him the honour of a visit a short time ago. Sir WIlliam had not
called upon the old gentleman for eight years-it was the visit he was
thinking of returning.
He is very much shaken,'' Emmy whispered, as Dobbin went up and
cordially shook hands with the old man.
Although he had such particular business in London that evening, the
Major consented to forego it upon Mr. Sedley's invitation to him to come
home and partake of tea. Amelia put her arm under that of her young
friend with the yellow shawl, and headed the party on their return home-
wards, so that Mr. Sedley fell to Dobbin's share. The old man walker
very slowly, and told a number of ancient histories about himself and his
poor Messy, his former prosperity, and his bankruptcy. IIis thoughts, as
is usual with failing old men, were quite in former times. The past,
with the exception of the one catastrophe which he felt, he knew little
about. he Major was glad to let him talk on. His eyes were fixed
upon the figure in front of him-the der little figure always present
to his imagination and in his prayers, and visiting his dreams careful or
alumbering.
Amelia was very happy, smiling, and active all that evening; performing
her duties ns hostess of the little entertainment with the utmost grace and
propriety, as Dobbin thought. IIis eyes followed her about as they site
in the twilight. How many a time had he longed for that moment, and
thought of her far away under hot winds and in weary marches, gentle nd
happy, kindly ministering to the wants of old age, and decorating poverty
with sweet submission-as he saw her now. I do not say that his taste
was the highest or that it is the duty of great intellect to be content with
a bread-and-butter paradise, such as sufficed our simple old friend ; but
528

his desires were of this sort whether for good or bad ; and, with Amelia to
help him, he was as ready to drink as many cups of tea nss Doctor Johnson.
Amelia seeing this propensity, laughingly encouraged it; and looked
exceedingly roguish as she administered to him cup after cup. It is true
she did not know that the Major had had no dinner, and that the cloth
was laid for him at the Slaughter's, and a plate laid thereon to mark that
the table was retained, in that very box in which the Major and George
had sate many a time carousing, when she was a child just come home
from Miss Pinkerton's school.
The first thing Mrs. Osborne showed the Major was Georgy's miniature,
for which she ran up stairs on her arrival at home. It was not half hand-
some enough of course for the boy, but wasn't ithoblec of him to think of
bringing it to his mother Whilst her papa was awake she did not talk
much about Gcorgy. To hear about Mr. Osborne and Russell Square was
not agreeable to the old man, who very likely was unconscious that he had
been living for some months past mainly on the bounty of his richer rival;
and lost his temper if allusion was made to the other.
Dobbin told him all, and a little more perhaps thun all, that had happened
on board the Ramchunder; and exaggerated Jos's benevolent dispositions
towards his father, and resolution to make him comfortable in his old
days. The truth is that during the voyage the Major had impressed this
duty most strongly upon his fellow-passenger and extorted promises from
him that he would take charge of his sister and her child. He soothed
Jos's irritation with regard to the bill which the old gentleman had
drawn upon him, gave a laughing account of his own sufferings on the
same score, and of the famous consignment of wine with which the old
man had f:poured him: and brought Mr. Jos, who was by no means an
ill-natured person when well pleased and moderately flattered, to a very
good state of feeling regarding his relatives in Europe.
And in fine I am ashamed to say that the Major stretched the truth so
far as to tell old Mr. Selley that it was mainly a desire to see his parent
which brought Jos one more to Europe.
At. his accustomed hour Mr. Selley began to dose in his chair, and
then it was Celsius's opportunity to commence her conversation which
she did with great eagerness;-it related exclusively to Georgy. She
did not talk at all about her own sufferings at breaking from him, for
indeed this worthy women, though she was half-killed by the separation
from the child, yet thought it was very wicked in her to refine at losing
lim; but everything concerning him, his virtues, talents, and prospects,
she poured out. She described his angelie beauty; narrated a hundred
instances of his generosity and greatness of mind whilst living with her:
how a Royal Duchess had stopped and admired him in Kensington
Gardens ; how splendid he was cared for now, and how he had a groom
nd a on; what quickness and cleverness e ha, and what a prodi-
grossly well-read and delightful person the Reverend Lawrence Vel was,
George's master. Ie knows every/hling,'' Amelia said.  IIe has the
most delightful parties. You who are so learned yourself, and have read
so much, and are so clever and accomplished-don't shake your head and
say no-IIe always used to say you were-you will be charged with

Mr. Veal's parties. The last Tuesday in every month. IIe says there is
no place in the bar or the senate that Georgy may not aspire to. Look
here,'' and she went to the piano-drawer and drew out a theme of George's
composition. This great effort of genius, which is still in the possession
of George's mother, is as follows:
On Usefulness.-Of all the vices which degrade the human character,
Selfishness is the most odious and contemptible. An undue love of Self
leads to the most monstrous crimes; and occasions the greatest misfortunes
both in States and Families. As a selfish man will impoverish his family
and often bring them to ruin: so a selfish king brings ruin on his people
and often plunges them into war.
Example: The selfishness of Achilles, as remarked by the poet ISomer,
occasioned a thousand woes to the Greeks-upi  Ayois hy' E6de-
(IDiom. Il. A. 2). The selfishness of the late Napoleon Bonaparte ones-
signed innumerable wars in Europe, and caused him to perish, himself, in
a miserable island-that of Saint Helena in the atlantic Ocean.

and ambition, but that we are to consider the interests of others as well
as our own.,

the delighted mother said.  O William,'' she added, holding out her
and to the Major-'` whnt a treasure 1Heaven has given me in that boy

thought. ` Ought I to be jealous of my friend in the grave, or hurt that

George, how little you knew the prize you had, though.'' This sentiment
passed rapidly through William's mind, as he was holding Amelia's hand,
whilst the handkerchief was veiling ler eyes.
Dear friend,'' she said, pressing the hand which held hers, ` IIow
good, how kind you always have been to mel See Pupa is stirring.
one will go and see Georgy to-morrow, won't you''
:Not to-morrow,'' said poor old Dobbin. ` I have business.'' He
did not like to own that he had not as yet been to lis parents' and is car
sister Anne-a remissness for which i am sure every well-regulated person
will blame the Major. Aul presently he took his leave, leaving his address
behind him for Jos, against the latter's arrival. And so the first day was
over, and he had seen her.
When he got back to the Slaughter's, the roast fowl was of course cold,
in which condition he ate it for supper. And knowing what early hours
his family kept, and that it would be needless to disturb their slumbers at
so late an hour, it is on record, that MInor Dobbin treated himself to half-
price at the hAymarket Theatre that evening, where let us hope he enjoyed
himself.

and tied the old man's neckcloth in a smart bow, and put his brooch into
his best shirt frill, in which, in his Sunday sit of mourning, he sat from
six o'clock in the morning awaiting the arrival of his son.
There are some splendid tailors' shops in the High Street of southampton,

in the fine plate-glass windows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all
sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last new
fashions in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and
holding on to little boys with the exceeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle
ladies in riding habits prancing by the Statue of Achilles at Apsley House.
Jos, although provided with some of the most splendid vests that Calcutta
could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with
one or two of these garments, and selected a crimson satin, embroidered
with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes
and a rolling collar, with which, and a rich blue satin stock and a gold pin,
consisting of a five-barred gatc with n horseman in pink enamel jumping
over it, he thought he might make his entry into London with some
dignity. For Jos's former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had
given way to a more candid and courageous self-assertion of his worth.,
I don't care about owning it,'' Waterloo Sedley would say to li
friends, '`I am a dressy man:'' and though rather uneasy if the allies
looked at him at the Government House balls, and though he flushed
and turned away alarmed under their glanees, it was chiefly from a
dread Cst they should make love to him, that he avoided them, being
verse to marriage altogether. But there was no such swell in Cnl-
outta as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say: nnl he had the handsomest
turn-out, gave the best bachelor dinners, and had the finest plate in the
whole place.
To make these waiscoats for a man of his size and dignity took at least
a day, part of which he employed in living a servant to wait upon him
and his native; and in instructing the agent who cleared his baggage,
his boxes, his books, which he never read; his chests of mangoes, chutney,
and currie-powders; his shawls for presents to people whom he didn't
know as yet; and the rest of his Series appearance.
At length, he drove leisurely to London on the third day, and in
the new waistcoat. The native, with chattering teeth, shuddering in a
shawl on the box by the side of the new EUropean servant, Jos puffing his
pipe at intervals within, and looking so majestic, that little boys cried
DOorway, and many people thought he must be a Governor-General. 
I promise, did not decline thc obsequious invitation of the landlords to
light and refresh himself in the next country towns. Having partaken of
a copious breakfast, with fish, and rice, and hard eggs, at Southampton,
he had so far rallied at WInchester as to think a glass of sherry necessary.
At Alton he stepped out of the carriage, at his servant's request, and
imbibed some of the all for which the place is famous. At Furuha he
stopped to view the Bishop's Castle, and to partake of a light dinner of
stewed cell, veal outlets, and French beans, with a bottle of claret. He
was cold over Bagslot Heath, where the native chattered more and more,
and Jos Sahib took some brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into
town, he was as full of wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and
tobacco, as the steward's cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening when
his carriage thundered up to the little door in Brompton, whither the
affectionate fellow drove first, and before lying to the apartments secured
for him by Mr. Dobbin at the 9laughter's.

A NOVEL WITHOUT A HER0.
533
All the faces in the street were in the windows; the little maid-servant
flew to the wicket-gate, the Messages Clapp looked out from the basement
of the ornamented kitchen; eMmy, in n great flutter, was in the passage
among the hats and coats, and old Selley in the parlour inside, shaking all
over. Jos descended from the post-chaise and down the creaking swaying
steps in awful state, supported by the new valet from Southampton and
the shuddering native, whose brown face was now livid with cold, and of
the colour of a turkey's gizzard. He created an immense sensation in the
passage presently, where Mrs. and Miss Clapp, coming perhaps to listen
nt the parlour door, found ILoll Jewel shaking upon the hall-bench under
the costs, moaning in a strange tenuous way, and showing his yellow
eyeballs and white teeth.
For, you see, we have adroitly shut the door upon the meeting between
Jos and the old father, and the poor little gentle sister inside. hoe old
man was very fuel affected: so, of course, was his daughter: nor was
Jos without feeling. In that long absence of ten years, the most selfish
will think about home and early ties. IBftancee sunctifies both. Long
brooding over those lost pleasures exaggerates their charm and sweetness.
Ios was unaffected glad to see and shake the hand of his father, between
whom and himel there had been a coolncss-glad to see his little sister,
whom he remembered so pretty and smiling, anti panel at the alteration
which time, grief,. and misfortune had mall 'in the shattered old man.
Emmy had come out to the door in her. black clothes and whispered to
him of her mother's death, nnl not to speak of it to the father. hIre
was no need of this caution, for the older Seley himself hogan immediately
to speak of the event, and nrnttlud about it,and wept ve it plenteously.
It shocked the Indian not a little, and made him think of himself less than
the poor fellow was accustomed to do.
The result of the interview must have been very stiffnctory, for when
Jos had reascendcd his post-chaise, and hail driven away his hotel, Army
embraced her father tcnderly, appealing to him with an air of triumph, and
asking the old man whether she did not always say that her brother had a
good heart
Indeed, Joseph Smiley, affected by the humble position in which he
found his relations, and in to expansiveness and slowing of heart
occasioned by the first meeting, declared that they shouladfivcr suffer want
or discomfort any more, the h was at home for someone at any rate,
during which his house and everything he had should bears; and that
Amelia would look very pretty at the end of his table--atil-she would

accept one of her own.
.L.
She shook her head sadly, and had, no usual, recourse to the water-
works. She knew what he meant. She and her young confidante, Miss
Mary, had talked over the matter most fully, the very night of the Major'a
visit; beyond which time the impetuous Polly could not refrain from talk-
in of the discovery which she hand made, nd leseribiug the start and

if he was married, and he said,  Who told you those lies2' O Mas'am,''
Polly said, ``he never kept his eyes off you; and I 'm sure he's grown
grey a-thinking of you.''
But Amelia, looking up at her bed, over which hung the portraits of
her husband and son, told her young protege, never, never, to speak on
that subject again; that Major Dobbin had been her husband's dearest
friend, and her own and George's most kind and affectionate guardian;
that she loved him as a brother-but that a woman who had been married
to such u angel as that, and she pointed to the wall, could never think of
any other union. Poor Polly sighed: she thought what she should do if
young Mr. Tomkins, at the Surgery, who always looked at her so at
church, and who, by those mere aggressive glanees had put ler timorous
little heart into such a flutter that she was ready to surrender at once,-
what she should do if he were to die She knew he was consumptive,
his checks were so red, and he was so uncommon thin in the waist.
Not that Emmy, being made aware of the honest Major's passion,
rebuffed him in any way, or felt displeased with him. Such an attach-
went from so true and loyal a gentleman could make no woman angry.
Desdemona was not angry with Cussio, though there is very little doubt
she saw the Lieutenant's partiality for her (and I for my part believe that
many more things took place in that sad affair than the worthy Moorish
officer ever knew of); why, Miranda was even very kind to Culiban, and we
may be pretty sure for the same reason. Not that she would encourage him
in the least,-the poor uncouth monster-of course not. No more would
Emmy by any means encourage her admirer, the Major. She would give
him that friendly regard, which so much excellence and fidelity merited;
she would treat lim with perfect cordinlity and frankness until he made
his proposals; and then it would be time enough for her to speak, and to
put an end to hopes which never could be realised.
She slept, therefore, very soundly that evening, after the conversation
with Miss Polly, and was more than ordinarily happy, in spite of Jos's
delaying. ''I am glad he is not going to try that Miss O'Dowd,'' she
tlougrlt.  Colonel O'Dowd never could have a sister fit for such an
accomplished cnn us Major William,'' Who was there amongst her little
circle, who would nuke him a good wife? Not MIss Binney, she was too
old nnl ill-tempered; Miss Osborne :-too old too. Little Polly was too
young. Mrs. Osborne could not find anybody to suit the Major before
she went to sleep.
HOwever when the postman made his appearance, the little party were
put out of suspense, by the receipt of a letter from Jos to his sister, who
announced, that he felt little futigued after his voyage, and should not be
able to move on that day, but that he would leave Southampton early the
next morning, and go with his father and mother at evening. Amelia as
she read out the letter to her father, paused over the latter word; her
mother, it was clear, did not know what has happened in the family.
Nor could he: for the fact is that though the Major rightly suspected that
his traclling companion never would be got into motion in so short as
apnce as twenty-four hours, and would find some excuse for delaying, yet
Dobbin hal not written to Jos to inform him of the calamity which had

befallen the Sedley family: being oceeupicd in talking with Amelia until
long alter post-hour.
The same morning brought Major Dobbin a letter to the Slaughter'a
Code lIouse from his friend at Southampton; begging dear Dob to excuse
Jos for big in a rage when awakened the day before (he lal a confounded
enl-ache, and was just in his first sleep), and sentencing Dob to engage
comfortable rooms at the Slaughter's for Mr. Sedley and his servants.
The Major had become necessary to Jos during the voyage. lIe was
attached to him, and hung upon im. The other passengers were way
to London. oung Ricketts and little Chaffers went away on the coach
that day-Ricketts on the box, and taking the ruins fro Notley; the
Doctor was of to his family at Sports;: rug gone to town to his
co-partners; and the first mate busy in the unloading of the Ramchunder.
Mr. Jos was very lonely nt Southampton, and got the landlord of the
George to take a glass of wine with him that day; at the very hour nt
which Major Dobbin was seated at the table of his father, in William, where
his sister found out (for it was impossible for the Major to tell fins) that
he had been to see Mars. George Osborne.
Jos was so comfortably situated in Saint Martin's Lane, le could enjoy
is hookah there with such perfect case, and cull swagger down to the
theatres, when minded, so agreeably, that, perhaps, he would have
remnincl altogether at the Slaughter's had not his friend, the Major, been
at his elbow. That gentleman would not let the glendale rest until he
had executed his promise of having a home for amelia and his father. Jos
was a soft fellow in anybody's hands; Robin most active in anybody's
concerns but his own; the civilian was, therefore, an easy victim to the
guiltless arts of this good-natured diplomalist, and was ready to do, to
purchase, hire, or relinquish whatever his friend thought fit. Loll Jews,
of whom the boys about Saint Martin's Lane used to make cruel fun
whenever he showed his dusky countenance in the street, was sent back to
Calcutta in the Lady Kicklebury Last Indian, in which Sir William
Dobbin had a share; having previously taught Jos's European the art of
preparing curries, laws, and pipes. It was a matter of great delight
and occupation to Jos to superintend the building of a smart chariot,
which he and the Major ordered in the neighbouring Long hEre: and a pair
of handsome horses were robbed, with which Jos drove about in state in
the Park, or to call upon his Indian friends. Amelia was not seldom by
his side on these excursions, when also MAjor Dobbin would be seen in
the back seat of the carriage. At other ties Old Selby and his daughter
took advantage of it: and Miss Clapp, who frequently accompanied er
friend, had great pleasure in being recognised as she sat in the carriage,
dressed in the famous yellow shawl, by the young gentleman at the surgery,
whose face might commonly be seen over the window-blinds as she passed.
Shortly after Jos's first appearance at Brompton, a dismal scene, indeed,
took place at that humble cottage, at which the Sedley had passed the
last ten years of their life. Jos's carriage (the temporary one, not the
chariot under construction) arrived one day and carried off old Sedley
and his daughter-to return to more. The tears that were shed by the

landlady and the landlady's daughter at that event were as genuine tears
of sorrow as any that have been outscored in the course of this history.
In their long acquaintanceship and intimacy they could not recall a harsh
word that had been uttered by Amelia. Sho had been all sweetness and
kindness, always thankful, always gentle, even when MIrs. Clapp lost her
own temper, and pressed for the rent. When the kind creature was going
away for good and all, the landlady reproached herself bitterly for ever
having used a rough expression to her-how she wept, as they stuck up
with wafers on the window, a paper notifying that the little rooms so
long occupied were to let1 They never would have such lodgers again,
that was quite clear. After-life proved the truth of this melancholy pro-
they: and Mrs. Clapp revenge herself for the deterioration of mankind
by levying the most savage contributions upon the tea-caddies and legs
of mutton of her localities. Most of them scolded and grumbled; some
of them did not pay: none of them stayed. The landlady might well
regret those old, old friends, who had left her.
As for Miss Mary, her sorrow at Meli's departure was such as I shall
not attempt to depict. From childhood upwards she had been with her
daily, and had attached herself so passionately to that denr good lady, that
when the grand bnrouche came to carry her off into splendour, she fainted
in the arms of her friend, who was indeed scarcely less affected than the
good-natured girl. Amelia loved her like a daughter. During cleven
years the girl had bccn her constant friend and associate. The separation
was a very painful one indeed to her. But it was of course arranged that
Mary was to come and stay often at the grand new house whither MIrs.
Osborne was going; and where Mary was sure she would never be so
happy as she had been in their humble coats Miss Clan called it in the
language of the novels which she loved.
Let us hope she was wrong in her judgment. Poor Emy's days of
happiness had been very few in that hubble cot. A gloomy ate had
oppressed her there, She never liked to come back to the house after
he had left it, or to face the landlady who had tyrannical over her when
ill-humoured and unpaid; or when please had treated her with a coarse
familiarity scarcely less odiou. Her servility and fulsome compliments
when Emmy was in prosperity were not more to that lady's liking. She
cast about notes of admiration all over the new house, cxtolling every
article of furniture or ornament; she fingered MIrs, Osborne's dresses, and
calculate their price. Nothing could be too good far that sweet lady,
she vowel and protested. bUt in the vulgar sycophaut who now paid
court to her, Emmy always remembered the coarse tyrant who had made
her miserable many a time to whom she had been forced to put up pet-
tions for time, when the rent was overdue; who tried out at her extra-
vance if she bought delicacies for her ailing mother or father; who had
seen her humble and trampled upon her.
Nobody ever heard of these griefs, which had been part of our poor little
woman's lot in life. She kept them secret from her father, whose improv-
evidence was the cnnse of much of her miser. She had to lend all the
blame of his misloings, nd indeed was so utterly gentle and humble as
to be made by nature for a victim.
A NOVEL WITH0U A PIER0.

(
I hope she is not to suffer much more of that hard usage. And, as
in all griefs, there is said to be some consolation, I may mention that
poor Mary, when left at her friend's departure in a hysterical condition,
was placed under the medical treatment of the young fellow from the
surgery, under whose care she rallied after a short period. lEmmy, when
she went away from lBrompton, endowed Mary with every article of furniture
that the house contained: only taking away her pictures (the two pictures
over the bed) and her piano-that little old piano which had now passed
into a plaintive jingling old age, but which she loved for reasons of her
own. She was a child when first she played on it: and her parents gave
it her. It had been given to her again since, as the reader may remember,
when her father's house was gone to run, and the instrument was recovered
out of the week.
Major Dobbin was exceedingly pleased when, as he was superintendent
the arrangements of Jos's new house, which the Major insisted should be
very handsome and comfortable; the cart arrived from Brompton, bringing
the trunks and band-boxes of the emigrants from that village, and with
them the old piano. Amelia would have it up in her sitting-room, a neat
little apartment on the second floor, adjoining ler father's chamber: and
where the old gentleman sate commonly of evenings.
When the men appeared thon bearing this old music-box, and Amelia
ve orders that it should be placed in the chamber aforesaid, Dobbin was
quite elated.  I 'm glad you 've kept i,'' he said in a very sentimental
manner. '" I was afraid you lid'nt care about it.''
 I value it more than anything I have in the world,'' said Amelia.
Do you, Amelia?'' cried the Major. The fact is, as he had bought
it himself, though he never said anything about it, it never entered into
his head to suppose that Emmy should think anybody else was the pur-
chaser, and as a matter of course, he fancied that she knew the gift came
from him. : Do you, Amelia?'' he said; and the question, the great

Emmy did not note the circumstance nt the time, nor take mime-
date heed of the very dismal expression which honest Dobbin's county-
nance assumed; but she thought of it afterwards. And then it struck
her, with irrepressible pain and mortificntion too, that it was William who
was the giver of the piano; and not George, as she and faneied. It was
not George's gilt; the only one which she had received from her lover, as
she thought-the thing she had cherished become all others-her dearest
relic aud prize. She had spoken to it about George; played his favourite
airs upon it; sale for long evening hours, touching, to the best of her
simple art, melancholy harmonies on the keys, and weeping over them in
silence. It was not George's relic. It was valueless now. The next
time that old Sedley asked her to play, she soil it was shockingly out of
tune, that she had a headache, that she couldn't play.
Then, according to her custom, she rebuked herself for hcr pcttislness
and ingratitude, and declined to make a reparation to honest William
for the slight she had not expressed to him, but had felt for his piano.

A few days afterwards, as they were seated in the drawing-room, where
Jos had fallen asleep with great comfort after dinner, Amelia said with
rather a faltering voice to Major Dobbin,-
I have to be your pardon for something.''
 About what'' said he.
 About-about that little square piano. I never thanked you for it
when you have it be; many, many years ago, before I was married. I
thought somebody else had given it. Think you, William.'' She held
out her hand; but the poor little woman's heart was bleeding; and as for
her eyes, of course they were at their work,
Bit William could hold no more. ``Amelia, Amelia,'' he said, '` I did buy
it for you. I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved
you from the first minute that I saw you, when George brought me to your
house, to show me the Amelia whom he was engaged to. ou were but a girl,
in white, with large ringlets; you came down singing-do you remember 2
-and we went to Vnuxhall. Since then I have thought of but one woman
in the world, and that was you. I think there is no hour of the day has
passed for twelve years that I haven't thought of you. I came to tell you
this before I went to India, but you did not care, and I hadn't the heart
to speak. You did not care whether I stayed or went''
I was very ungrateful,'' AMelia said.
No; only indifferent,'' Dobbin continued, desperately. I have nothing
to make a woman to be otherwise. I know what you are feeling now.
ou are hurt in your heart at that discovery about the piano; and that it
came from me and not from George. I forgot, or I should never have
spoken of it so. It is for me to ask your pardon for being a fool for a
moment, and thinking that years of constancy and devotion might have
pleaded with you.''
It is you who are cruel now,'' Amelia said with some spirit. `` George
is my husband, here and in heaven. How could I love and other but
him? I am his now as when you first saw me, lear William. It was he
who told me how good and generous you were, and who taught me to
love you as a brother. Hae you not been everything to me and my boy 
Our nearest, truest, kindest, friend and protector And you come a few
months sooner perhaps you might have spared me that-that dreadful
parting. O, it early killed me, William-but you didn't come, though
I wished and prayed for you to come, and they took him too any from
me. Isn't he a noble boy, William? Be his friend still and mine''-and
here her voice broke, and she had her face on his shoulder.
The Major folded his ars round her, holding her to him as if she was
a child, and kissel her head.  I will not change, dear Amelia,'' he said.
I ask for no more than your love. I think I would not have it other-
wise. Only lel mce stay ear you, and see you often.''
 Yes, often,'' Amelia sail. And so William was at liberty to look and
long: as the poor boy at school who has no money may sigh after the
contents of the art-woman's tray.

two years before it failed for a million, and plunged half the Indian public

Scape, ruined, honest, and broken-hearted nt sixty-five years of age,
went out to Calcutta to wind up the affairs of the house. Walter Scape
was withdrawn from Eton, and put into a merchant's house. Florence
Cape, Fanny Scape, and their mother filed away to Boulogne, and will
be heard of no more. To be brief, Jos stepped in and bought their
carpets and sideboards, and adirel himself in the mirrors which had
reflected their king handsome faces. The Scape tradesmen, all honourably
paid, left their cards, and were eager to supply the new household. The
large men in white waistcoats, who waited at cape's inner, green-grocers,
bank-porters, and milkmen in their private capacity, left their addresses,
and ingratiated themselves with the butler. Mr. Chummy, the chimney-
purifier, who had swep the last three families, tried to coax the hitler and
the boy under him, whose duty it was to go out covered with buttons
and with stripes down his browsers, for the protection of Mrs. Amelia
whenever she chose to walk abroad.
It was a modest establishment. The butler was Jos's valet also, and
never was more drunk than a butler in a small family should be who has
a proper regard for his master's wine. Enemy was supplied with a maid,
grown on Sir William Dobbin's suburban estate: a good girl, whose
kindness and humility disarmed Mrs. Osborne, who was at first terrified
at the ideas of having a servant to wait upon herself, who did not in the
least know how to use one, and who always spoketo domestic with the
most reverential politeness. But this said was very useful in the family,
in dexterously tending oll Mr. Selley, who kent almost entirely to his own
quarter of the house, and never nixed in any of the gay doings which took
place there.
Numbers of people came to see Mrs. Osborne. Lady Dobbin and
daughters were delighted at her change of fortune, and united upon hcr.
Miss Osborne from russell Square came in her grand chariot with the
flaming hammercloth cmnblnzoned with the Leeds arms. Jos was reported
to be immensely rich. Ol Osborne had no objection that Georgy should
inherit his uncle's property as well as his own. ` Damn it, we will make
man of the feller,'' he said; ``and I'Ll see him in Parliament before I die.
To may go and see is mother, Miss O., though I'll never set eyes on
her:'' and Miss Osborne came. EMmy, you may be sure, was very glad
to scc her, and so bc brought career to George. That yong follow was

in his demeanor when that gentleman as present. He was a clever la,
and afraid of the Major. George could not help admiring his friend's
simplicity, his good-humour, his various learning quietly imparted, his
general love of truth and justice. He had met no such man as yet in the
course of his experience, and he had no distinctive liking for a gentleman.
He hung fondly by his god-father's side; and it was his delight to walk in
the Parks and hear Dobbin talk. William told George about his father,
about India and Waterloo, about everything but himself. When George
was more than usually pert and conceited, the Major made jokes at him,
which Mrs. Osborne thought very cruel. One day, taking him tote play,
and the boy declining to go into the pit because it was vulgar, the Major
took him to the boxes, left him there, and went down himself to the pit.
He had not been seated there very long, before he felt an arm thrust
under his, and a dandy little hand in a kid-glove squeezing his arm.
George had seen the absurdity of his ways, and come down from the upper
region. A tender laugh of benevolence lighted up old Dobbin's face and
eyes as he looked at the repentant little prodigal. le loved the boy, as he
did everything that belonged to Amelia. How charmed she was when she
heard of this instance of George's goodness Her eyes looked more kindly
on Dobbin than they ever had done. She brushed, he thought, after
looking at him so.
Georgy never tired of his praises of the MIaior to his mother. :I like
him, Mamma, because he knows such lots of things; and he ain't like old

Emy laughed: she thought it was very likely the Major could do
thus much.
If there was a sincere liking between George and the Major, it must be
confessed that between the boy and his uncle no great love existed.
George had got a way of blowing out his cheeks, and putting his hands in
his waistcont pockets, and saying, `' God bless my soul, youdon't say so,''
so exactly after the union of old Jos, that it was impossible to restrain
from laughter. The servants would explode at dinner if the lad, asking
for something which wasn't at table, put on that couutenance and used
that favourite phrase. Even obbin would shoot out a sudden deal at
the boy's mimicry. If George is not mimic his uncle to his face, it
was only by dObbin's rebukes and Amelia's terrified entreaties that the
little scapegrace was induced to resist. And the worthy civilian being
haunted by a dim consciousness that the lad thought him an ass, and was
inclined to turn him into ridicule, used to be extremely timorous and, of
course, doubly pompous and dignified in the presence of Master Georgy.
When it was announced that the young gentleman was expected in Gillespie

Street to dine with his mother, Mr. Jos commonly found that he had
an engagement at the Club. Perhaps nobody was much greed at his
absence. On those days Mr. Sedley would commonly be induced to come
out from his place of refuge in the upper storeys; and there would be a
small family party, whereof Major Dobbin pretty generally formedone. He
was the ami de la mason; old Sedley's friend, lEmmy's friend, Georgy's
friend, Jos's counsel and adviser. ` He might almost as well be at MIaras
for anything e see of him,'' Miss Ann bDobbin remarked, at Camberwell.
Ahl Miss And, did it not strike you that it was not you whom the MAjor
wanted to marry i
Joseph Sedley then led a life of dignified porosity such as became a
person of his eminence. His very first point, of course, was to become a
member of the Oriental Club: where he spent his mornings in the com-
many of his brother Indians, where he died, or whence he brought lom
men to dine.
Amelia had to receive and entertain these gentlemen and their allies.
From these she heard how soon with would be in Council, how many
lakes Jones had brought home with him  how Thomson's house in London
had refused the bills drawn by Thomson, Kibbee and Co., the Bombay

very imprudent, to say the least of it, MIrs. Brown's conduct (wife of
Brown of the Ahmednuggnr Irregulars) had been with young Swankey of
the bOdy Guard, sitting up with him on deck until all hours, and losing
themselves as they were riding out at the Cupe: how Mrs. Aryan
had had out her thirteen sisters, daughters of a country curate, the Re,
Felix Rabbits, and married eleven of them, seven high up in the service:
how Hornby was wild because his wife would stay in europe, nd Trotter
was appointed Collector at Ummerapoora. This and similar tlk took
place, at the grand dinners all round. They had the same conversation;

don't the clergymen's ladies discourse about Sunday Schools, and who
takes whose duty ?-don't the very greatest allies of all talk about that
stall clique of persons to whom they belong, and why shall our Julian
friends not have their own conversation -only I admit it is slow for the
layer whose fate it sometimes is to sit by and listen.
Before long Emmy had a visiting-book, and was driving about regularly
in a carriage, calling upon Lady Bludyer (wife of Major-(General Sir roger
Bludyer, K.C.B., Bengal Army); Lay Huff, will of Sir G. Huf, BOmbay
lotto; Mrs. Price, the lady of Ice the Director, &c. We are not long in
using ourselves to changes in life. That carriage came round to Gillespie
Street every day: that buttons boy sprang up and down from the box
with Emmy's and Jos's visiting cards; at stated hours Emmy and the
carriage went for Jobs to the Club, and took him an airing; or, putting oll

She accommodated herself to one as to the other. If Fate had ordained

king's officer that's always hanging about the house-a long, thin, queer-
looking bodies fellow-a dry fellow though, that took the line out of a

Had the MAjor possessed a little more personal vanity he would have
been jealous of so dangerous a young buck, as that fascinating Bengal
Captain. But Dohbin was of too simple and generous a nature to have
any doubts about Amelia. He was glad that the young men should pay

subject of his Sovereign (showing himself in his full court suit at the Club,
whither Dobbin came to fetch him in a very sharply old uniform,) he who
had always been a staunch Loyalist and admirer of George I., became
such a tremendous Tory and pillar of the State, that he was for having
Amelia to go to a drawing-room, too. He somehow had worked himself
up to believe that he was implicated in the maintenance of the public we-
fare, and that the Sovereign would not be happy unless IOs Sedley and his
family appeared to rally round him at Saint James's.

a passion of grief and frantic tears, such s your end, brother reader, will

down more than the loss of your closest friend, or your first-born son-a

homely dinner with one or two of the old set-I shall be always glad to
see you''  So Jos and his acquaintances dined an drank their claret
among themselves in silence; whilst the sands of life were running out in
the old man's glass up stairs. The velvet-footed butler brought them
their wine; and they composed themselves to a rubber after dinner: at
which Major Dolbin would sometimes come and take a land: and
Mrs. Osborne would occasionally descend, when her patient above was
settled for the night, and had commenced one of those lightly trouble
slumbers which visit the pillow of old age.
The old man clung to his daughter during this sickness. He would
take his broths and medicines from scarcely any other hand. To tend
him became almost the sole business of her life. Her bed was placed
close by the door which opened into his chamber, and she was alive at the
slightest noise or disturbance from the couch of the querulous invalid.
Tough, to do him justice, he lay awake many an hour, silent and without
stirring, unwilling to awaken his kind and vigilant nurse.
IIc loved his daughter with more fondness no, perhaps, than ever he
has done since the days of her childhood. In the discharge of gentle
offices and kind filial duties, this simple creature shone mot especially.
 She walks into the room as silently as a sunbeam,'' Mr. Dobbin
thought, as he saw her passing in and out from her father's room: a
cheerful sweetness lighting up her face as she moved to and fro, graceful
and noiseless. When women are brooding over their children, or busied
in a sick room, who has not seen in their faces those sweet angelic beams
of love and pity
A secret feud of some years standing was thus healed: and with a tacit
reconciliation. In these last hours and touched by her love and goodness,
the old man forgot all his grief against her, and wrongs which he and his
wife had many a long night debated: how she had given up everything
for her boy: how she was careless of her parents in their old age and
misfortune, and only thought of the child: how absurlly and foolishly,
imperious indeed, she took on, when George was removed from her. Old
Medley forgot these charges as he was making up his last account, and did
justice to the gentle and uncomplaining little martyr. One night when
she stole into his room, she found lim awake, when the broken old man
made his confession. O, Emmy, I've been thinking we were very
unkind and unjust to you,'' he said, and put out his cold and feeble hand
to her. She knelt down and played by his bedside, as he did too, having
still hold of her hand. When our turn comes, friend, may we have such
company in our prayers.
Perhaps as he was lying awake then, his life may have passed before
lim-his early hopeful struggles, his manly successes and prosperity, his
downfall in his declining years, and his present helpless condition-no

To have, and to be forced to yield,; or to sink out of life, having played
and lost the game That must be a strange feeling, when a day of our
life comes and we say, `` To-orrov, success or failure won't matter much:
and the sun will rise, and all the myriads of mankind go to their work on
their pleasure as usual, but I shall be out of the turmoil''
So there came one morning and sunrise, when all the world got up and
net about its various works and pleasure, with the exception of Old Joseph
Sedley, who was not to fight with fortune, or to hope or scheme any more:
but to go and take up a quick and utterly unknown residence in a church
yarl at Brompton by the side of his old wife.
Major Dobbin, Jos, and Georgy followed his remains to the grave, ina
black cloth coach. Jos came on purpose from the Star and Garter at
Richmond, whither he retracted after the deplorable event. He did not
care to remain in the house, with the-under the circumstances, on un-
understand. But lEmmy staid and did her duty as usual. She was bowed
down by no especial grief, and rather solemn than sorrowful. She prayed
that her own and might be as calm and painless, and thought with trust

and reverence of the world which she had heard from her father during his
illness, indicative of his faith, his resignation, and his future hope.
Yes, I think that will be the better ending of the two, after all. Suppose
you are particularly rich and well to do, and say on that last day,''I am
very rich; I am tolerably well known; I have lived all my life in the best
society, and, thank Hence, come of a most respectable family. I have
served my King and country with honour. I was in Parliament for several
years, where, I may say, my speeches were listened to, and pretty well re-
received. I don't owe any man a shilling: on the contrary, I left my old
college friend, Jack Lazarus, fifty pounds, for which my exeeutors will not
press him. Leave my daughters with ten thousand pounds a-piece-very
good portions for girls: I bequeath my plate and furniture, my house in
Baker Street, with a handsome moisture, to my widow for her life; and my
landed property, besides money in the funds, and my cellar of well-selected
wine iu Baker Street, to my son. I leave twenty pound a-year to my valet;
and I defy any man after I am gone to find anything against my character.''
Or suppose, on the other hand, your swan sings quite a different sort of
dirge, and you say, '`I am a poor, blighted, disappointed old fellow, and
have made an utter failure through life. I was not endowed either with
bring or with good fortune: and confess that I have committed a hundred
mistakes and blunders. I own to having forgotten my duty many a time.
I can't pay what I owe. On my last bed I lie utterly helpless and
humble; and I pry forgiveness for my weakness, and throw myself with
a contrite heart, at the feet of the Divine Mercy.'' Which of these two
speeches, think you, would be the best oration for your own funeral old
Sedley made the last; and in that humble frame of mind, and holding by
the hand of his daughter, life and disappointment and unity sank any
from under him.
e You see,'' said old Osborne to George, '`what comes of merit and
industry, and judicious speculations, and that. Look at me and my banker's
account. Look at your per grandfather, Sedley, and his failure. And yet
he was a better man than i was, this day twenty years-a better man I
should say, by ten thousand pound.''
Beyond these people and Mr. Clapp's family, who came over from
Brompton to pay a visit of condolence, not a single soul alive ever cared
penny piece about old John Sedley, or remembered the existence of such
a person.
When old Osborne first heard from his friend Colonel Buckler (s little
Georgy has already informed us) how distinguished an officer Major
Dobbin was, he exhibited a great deal of scornful incredulity, and expressed
his surprise how eer such a feller as that should possess either brains or
reputation. But he heard of the Major's fame from various members of
his society. Sir William Dobbin had a great opinion of his son, and
narrated many stories illustrative of the Major's learning, valour, and
estimation in the world's opinion. Finally, his name appeared in the lists
of one or two great parties of the nobility; and this circumstance had a

been cycled to his grandfather, rendered some meetings between the two
gentlemen inevitable; and it was in one of these that old Osborne, a keen
nan of business, looking into the MAjor's accounts with his ward and the
boy's mother, got a hint which staggered him very much, and at once
pained anl pleased him, that it was out of William Dobbin's own pocket
that a part of the fund had been supplied upon which the poor widow and
the child had subsisted.
When pressed upon the point, Dobbin, who could not tell lies, flushed
and stammered a good deal, and finally confessed. ` The marriage,'' he
said, (at which his interlocutor's face grew dark,) '`was very much my
long. I thought my poor friend had gone so far, that retreat from his
engagement would have been dishouour to him, and death to Mrs.
Osborne; and I could do no less, when she was left without resources,
than give what money I could spare to maintain her,''
Major D.,'' Mr. Osborne said, looking hard at him, and turning very
red too-`' You did me a great injury; but give me leave to tell you, Sir,
you are an honest fuller. There's my hand, Sir, though I little thought
that my flesh and blood was a living on you-'' and the pair shook hands,
with great confusion on Major Dobbin's part, thus found out in his act of
charitable hypocrisy.
lIe strove to soften the old man, and reconcile him towards his sons
memory. ``IIe was such a noble follow,'' he said, '` that all of us led
him, and would have done anything for him. 1I, as a young man in those
days, was flattered beyond measure by his preference for to; and was
more pleased to be seen in his company the in that of the Commander-in-
Chief. I never saw his equal for pluck and daring, and all the qualities of
a soldier;'' and Dobbin told the old father as many stories as he could
remember regarding thc gallantry and achievements of his son. ``And
George is so like him,'' the MAjor added.
 IIe 's so like him the e makes me tremble sometimes,'' the gran-
father said.
On one or two evenings the Major came to dine with Mr, Osborne, (it
was during the time of the sickness of MIr. Sedley), and as the two sate
together in the evening after dinner all their talk was about the departed
hero. The father boasted about him according to his wont, glorifying
himself in recounting his son's feats anl gallantry, but his mood was at
any rute better and more charitable than that in which he had been
disposed until now to regard the poor fell; and the Christian heart of
the kind Major was pleased at these symptoms of returning peace and
good will. On the second evening old Osborne called Dobbin, WIlliam,
just as he used to do at the time when Dolbin and George were boys
together: and the honest gentleman was pleased by that mark of
reconciliation.
On the next day at breakfast when Miss Osborne, with the security of
her age and character, ventured to make some remark reflecting slightingl
upon the Major's appearance or behaviour-the master of the house
interrupted her. `' You'd have been glad enough to get him for yourself

 Tent he is, Grandpa,'' ssid Georgy, approvringly: and going p
close to the old gentleman he took a hold of his large grey whiskers, and
laughed in his face good-humoured and kissed him. nd he told the
story at night to his mother: who fully agreed with the boy.`` Indeed
he is,'' she said.  our dear father always said so. He is one of the
best and most upright of men.'' Dobbin happened to drop in very soon
after this conversation, which made Amelia blush perhaps; and the young
scapegrace increased the confusion by telling Dobbin the other part of the
story. `'I say Dob,'' he said, `` there's such an uncommon nice girl
wants to marry you. She's plenty of in : she wears a front : and she scolds
the servants from morning till night.,'' e Who is it2'' used Dobbin.
It 's aunt OF,'' the boy answered, ``Grandpa said so. And I say,
Dob, how primo it would be to have you for my uncle.'' Old Sedley's
quavering voice from the next room at this moment weakly called for
Amelia and the laughing ended.
That old Osborne's mind was changing was pretty clear. He asked
George about his uncle sometimes, and laughed at the boy's imitation of
the way in which Jos suid '' God-bless-my-soul'' and gobbled his soup.
Then he said, ` It's not respectful, Sir, of you younkers to be imitating
of your relations. Miss O, when you go out a-driving to-day, leave my
card upon Mr. Sedley, do you hear. here's no quarrel beatings me and
him anyhow.''
The card was turned, and Jos and the Major were asked to dinner,
--to a dinner the most splendid and stupid that perhaps ever Mr. Osborne
give; every inch of the family plate was exhibited, and the best company
was asked. Mr. Sedley took down Miss O. to dinner, and she was very
gracious to im; whereas she hardly spoke to the Major, who sate apart
from her, and by the side of Mr. Osborne, very timid. Jos said, with
great solemnity, it was the best clear turtle soup he had ever tasted in
his life ; and asked Mr. Osborne where he got his Madeira?
 It is some of Sedley's wine,'' whispered the butler to his master.
 I're and it a long time, and paid a good figure for it, to,'' Mr. Osborne
said aloud to his guest; and then whispered to his right-hand neighbour
how he had got it `` at the old chap's sole.''
More than one he asked the Major about-about Mrs. George Osborne
-a theme on which the Major could be very eloquent when he chose.
IIe told Mr. Osborne of her sufferings-of her passionate attachment to
her husband, whose meotry she worshipped still,-of the tender and
dutiful manner in which she had supported her parents, and given up ler
boy, when it seemed to her her duty to do so. : You don't know what
she endurol, Sir,'' said honest Dobbin, with a tremor in his voice; `` and
I hope and trust you will be reconciled to her. If she took your son
away from you, she gave her to you; and however much you loved your
George, depend on it, she loved hers ten times more.''
 By God, you are a good feller, Sir,'' was all Mr. Osborne said. It
and never struck him that the widow would feel any pin at parting with
the boy, or that his having a five fortune could grieve her. A reconciled-
tion was announced as speedy nand inevitable; and Amelia's heart already
began to bent at the notion of the awful meeting with George's father.
552
vANITY FAIR.
It was ever, however, destined to take place. Old Sedley's lingering
illness and death supervrened, after which a meeting was for some time
impossible. hat catastrophe and other events may have worked upon
Mr, Osborne. he was much shaken of late, and aged, and his mind was
working inwardly. He had sent for his lawyers, and probably changed
something in his will. The medical man who looked in, pronounced him
shaky, agitated, and talked of a little blood, and the sea-side; but he took
neither of these remedies.
One day when he should have come down to breakfast, his servant
missing him, went into his dressing-room, and found him lying at the
foot of the dressing-table in a fit. Miss Osborne was apprised; the
doctors were sent for : Georgy stopped away from school: the bleeders
and cuppers came. Osborne partially regained cognizance ; but never could
speak again,though he tried dreadfully once or twice, and in four days he died.
The doctors went down; the undertaker's men went up the stairs; and all
the shutters were shut towards the garden in Russell square. Bullock
rushed from the city in a hurry. : How much money had he left to that
boy -not half, surely Surely share and share like between the three?''
It was an agiiating moment.
What was it that poor old man had tried once or twice in vain to say
I hope it was that he wanted to see Amelia, and be reconciled before he
left the world to the year and faithful wife of his son : it was most likely
that ; for his will showed that the hatred which he had so long cherished
had gone out of his heart,
They found in the pocket of his dressing-gown the letter with the great
red seal, which George had written him from Waterloo. He had looked
at the other papers too, relative to his son, for the key of the box in
which he kept them was also in his pocket, and it was found the seals and
envelopes had been broken-very likely on the night before the seizure-
when the butler had taken him tea into his study, and found him reading in
the great red family bible.
When the will was opened, it was found that half the property was left
to George, and the remainder between the two sisters. Mr. Bullock to
continue, for their joint benefit, the affairs of the commercial house, or to
go out, as he thought fit. hn annuity of five hundred pounds, chargeable
on George's property, was left to his mother, the widow of my beloved
son George Osborne,' who was to resume the guardianship of the boy.
Msior William Dobbin, my beloved son's friend,' was appointed exe-
tutor; ` and as out of his kindness and bounty, and with his own private
funds, he maintained my grandson, and my son's widow, when they were
otherwise without means of support,' (the estimator went on to say)'I
hereby thank him heartily, for his love and regard for them; and beseech
him to accept such a sum as may be sufficient to purchase his commission as
a Lieutenant-Colonel, or to be disposed of in any way he may think it,'
When Amelia heard that her father-in-law was reconciled to her, her
heart melted, and she was grateful for the fortune left to her. But when
she heard how Georgy was restored to her, and knew how and by whom,
and how it was William's bounty that supported her in poverty, how it
was William who gave her her husband and her son-S, then she sank on

her knees, and prayed for blessings on that constant and king heart: she
bowed down and humbled herself, and kissed the feet, as it were, of that
beautiful and generous affection.
And gratitude was all that she had to pay back for such admirable de-
motion and benefits-only gratitude If she thought of any other return,
the image of George stood up out of the rare, and said, ` You are mine,
and mine only, now and for ever,''
William knew her feelings: had he not passed his whole life in divining
them'
WHen the nature of Mr. Osborne's will became known to the world, it
was edifying to remark how Mrs. George Osborne rose in the estimation
of the people forming her circle of acquaintance. The servants of Jos's
establishment, who used to question her humble orders, and say they would
`` ask aster,'' whether or not they could obey, neer thought now of that
sort of appeal. The book forgot to sneer at her shabby old gowns (which,
indeed, were quite eclipsed by that lady's fiery when she was dressed to
go to church of a sunday evening), the others no longer grumbled at the
sound of her bell, or delayed to answer that summons. The coaching,
who grumbled that his osses should be brought out, and his carriage made
into an hospital for that old feller and Mrs., O., drove her with the utmost
alacrity now, and trembling lest he should be superseded by Mr. Osborne's
coaching, asked '` what them there Russell Square coachmen knew about
to, and whether they was fit to sit on a box before a lady'' Jos's
friends, male and female, suddenly became interested about Emmy, and
cards of condolence multiplied on her hall table. Jos himself, who had
looked on her as a goodnatured harmless pnuper, to whom it was his duty
to give victuals and shelter, paid her and the rich little boy, his nephew,
the greatest respect-was anxious that she should have change and amuse-
ment after her troubles and trials, '`poor dear girl''-and began to appear
at the breakfast-table, and most particularly to ask how she would like to
dispose of the day.
In her capacity of guardian to Georgy, she, with the consent of the
Major, her fellow-trustee, begged Miss Osborne to live in the Russell
Square house as long as ever she chose to dwell there; but that lady, with
thanks, declared that she never could think of remaining alone in that
melancholy mansion, and departed in deep mourning, to Cheltenham, with
a couple of her old domestic. Theresa were liberally paid and dismissed;
the faithful oll butler, whom Mrs. Oborne proposed to retain, resigning
and preferring to invest his savings in a public-house, where, let us hope,
he was not prosperous. Miss Osborne not choosing to live in Russell
Square, Mrs. Osborne also, after consultation, declined to occupy the
gloomy old mansion there. The house was dismantled; the rich furniture
and effects, the awful chandeliers and dreary blank mirrors packed away
and hidden, the rich rosewood drawing-room suite was muffled in straw,
the carpets were rolled up and corded, the small select library of well-
bound books was stowed into two wine chests, and the whole paraphernalia
rolled away in several enormous vans to the Pantechnicon, where they were
to lie until Georgy's majority. And the great heavy dark plate-chests

went off to Messrs. Study und Rowdy, to lie in the cellars of those
eminent bankers until the same period should arrive.
One day lemmy with George in her hand and clad in deep sables went
to visit the deserted mansion which she had not entered since she was a
girl. The place in front was littered with straw where the vans had been
laden and rolled off. They went into the great blank rooms, the walls of
which bore the marks where the pictures and mirrors had hung. Then
they went up the great blank stone-staircases into the upper rooms, into
that where grandpa died, as George said in a whisper, and the higher
still into George's own room. The boy was still clinging by her side, but
she thought of another besides him. She knew that it had been his
father's room as well as his own.
She went up to one of the open window (one of those at which she
used to game with a sick heart when the child was first taken from her)
and thence as she looked out she could see over the trees of Russel Square,
the old house in which she herself was born, and where she had passed so
many happy as of sacred youth. They all came back to her, the pleasant
holidays, the kind faces, the careless, joyful past times; and the long
pains and trials that had since cast her down. She thought of these
and of the man who had been her constant protector, her good genius, her
sole benefactor, her tender and generous friend.
`Look here, mother,'' said Georgy, `` here's a G. O. separated on the
glass with a diamond; I never saw it before, I never did it.''
iT was your father's room long long before you were born, George,''
she said, and she brushed as she kissed the boy.
She was very silent as they drove back to Richmond where they had
taken a temporary house: where thesmiling lawyers used to come bustling
over to see her: (unl we may be sure noted the visit in the bill) and
where of course there was a room for Major Dobbin too, who rode over
frequently, having much business to transact in behalf of his little wort.
Georgy at this time was removed from Mr, Veal's on an unlimited
holiday, and that cntlcman was engaged to prepare an inscription fora
fine marble slab, to be placed up in the bundling under the monument of
Captain George Osborne.
The female Bullock, aunt of Georgy, although despoiled by that little
monster of one-half of the sum which she expected from her father, never-
theless showed her charitableness of spirit by being reconciled to the
mother and the boy. Roehampton is not far from Richmond, and one
any the chariot, with the golden Bullocks emblazoned on the panels,
and the faceted children within, drove to Amelia's house at Richmond;
and the Bullock family made an corruption into the garden, where Amelia
was reading n book, Jos was in an arbour placidly dipping strawberries
into wine, and the MAjor in one of his Indian jackets was giving a back to

in their hats, and huge black snshes, accompanying their mourning

glanced towards that dear child, an wholesome little Miss of seven
years of age.
` Rosa, go and kiss your car cousin,'' Mrs. Frederick said.  Don't
you know me, George f-I am your aunt,''
IT know you well enough,'' George said; ` but I don't like kissing,
please;'' and he retreated from the obedient caresses of his cousin.
 Take me to your dear mamma, you droll child,'' Mrs. Frederick said;
and those ladies accordingly met, after an absence of more than fifteen
years. During Emmy's cares and poverty the other had never once
thought about coming to see her; but now that she was deeently prosperous
in the world, her sister-in-law came to her as a matter of course.
So did numbers more. Our old friend, Miss Schwartz, and her hus-
band came thundering over from Hampton Court, with flaming yellow
liveries, and was as impetuously fond of Amelia as ever. Schwartz
would have liked her always if she could have seen her. One must do
her that justice. But, ue ooulez sos '-in this vast town one has not
the time to go and seek one's friends; if they drop out of the rank
they disappear, and we march on without them. Who is ever missed in
Vanity Fair:
But so, in a word, and before the period of grief for Mr. Osborne's
death had subsided, Emmy found herself in the centre of a very genteel
circle indeed; the members of which could not conceive that anybody
belonging to it was not very lucky. There was scarce one of the ladies
that can't a relation a eer, though the husband might be a lrysalter in
the City. Some of the ladies were very blue and well informed; reading
Mrs. Somerville, and frequenting the Royal Institution; others were
severe and Evangelical, and held by Exeter Hall. Emmy, it must be
owned, found herself entirely at a loss in the midst of their claves, and
suffered woefully on the one or two occasions in which she was compelled
to accept Mrs. Frederick Bullock's hospitalities. That july persisted in
patronising her, and determined most graciously to form her. She found
Amelia's milliners for her, and regulated her household and her manners.
She drove over constantly from Roehampton, and entertained her friend
with faint fashionable fiddlefadlle and feeble Court slipslop. Jos liked to
hear it, but the Major used to go off growling at the appearance of this
woman, with her twopenny gentility. He went to sleep under Frederick
Bullock's bald heal, after dinner, at one of the banker's best parties, (Fred
was still anxious that the balance of the Osborne property should be
transferred from Stumpy and low's to them), and whilst Amelia, who
did not know Latin, or who wrote the last creek article in the Edinburgh,
and did not in the last deplore, or otherwise, Mr, Peel's late extradite-
nary tergivsersation in the fatal Catholic Relief Bill, sate dumb amongst the
ladies in the grand drawing-room, looking out upon velvet lawns, train
gravel walks, and glistening hot-houses.
She seems goodnatured but insiid,'' said Mrs. Rowdy; `` that Major
seems to be particularly eris.''
She wants to sadly,'' said Mrs. IIollyoeck. ` MIy tear creature, you
never will be able to form her.''
 She is dreadfully ignorant or indifferent,'' said Mrs. Glory, with a

voice as if from the grave, and a sad shake of the head and turban-` I
asked her if she thought that it was in 1836, according to Mr. Jowls, or
in 183, according to Mr. Wapshot, that the one is to all: and she
said-' Poor Pope I hope not-What has he done?''
She is my brother's widow, my dear friends,'' Mrs. Frederick replied,
`and as such i think we're all bound to give her every attention and in-
reduction on entering into the world. You may fancy there can be no
mercenary motives in those whose disappointments are well known.''
tHat poor dear Mrs. Bullock,'' ssid Rowdy to Hollyock, as they drove
away together-'' she is always scheming and managing. She wants Mrs.
Osborne's account to be taken from our house to her-and the way in
which she coates that boy, and makes him sit by that clear-eyed little
Rosa, is perfectly ridiculous.''
I with Glory was choked with her Man of Sin and her Battle of
Armageddon,'' cried the other; and the carriage rolled away over Putney
Bridge.
But this sort of society was too cruelly genteel for Emmy: and all
jumped for joy when a foreign tour was proposed.

that sate by themselves near the wheel, stared at everybody, and spoke to

vehicles : it was difficult to pass in and out amongst them: and the poor
inmates of the fore-cabin had scarcely any space for locomotion. These
consisted of a few magnificently attired gentlemen from IHIoundsditch, who
brought their own provisions, and could have bought half the gay people
in the grand saloon; a few honest fellows with pistachios and portfolios,
who set to sketching before they had been half-an-hour on board; one or
two French femmes de eamre who began to be dreadfully ill by the
time the boat had passed Greenwich; a groom or two who lounged in
the neighbourhood of the horse-boxes under their charge, or leaned
over the side by the paddle-wheels, and talked about who was good for
the Leger, and what they stood to win or lose for the Goodwood
cup.
All the couriers, when they had done plunging about the ship, and had
settled their various masters in the cabins or on the week, congregated
together and began to clatter and smoke; the Hebrew gentlemen joining
them and looking at the carriages. There was Sir John's great carriage
that would hold thirteen people; my Lord Methuselah's marriage, my Lord
Reactor's chariot, british, and fourgon, that anybody might pay for who
liked. It was a wonder how my Lord got the ready money to pay for
the expenses of the journey. The Hebrew gentlemen knew how he got it.
They knew what money his Lordship had in his pocket at that instant,
and what interest he paid for it, and who gave it him. Finally there was
a very neat, handsome travelling carriage, about which the gentlemen
speculated.
 A ui cette footage a '' said one gentleman-courier with a large
morocco money-bag and ear-rings, to another with ear-rings and a large
morocco money-bag.
e C's a IKirsch je bensc-e ai  fate  l'here-i remit des
sancicles dans la picture,'' said the fourier in a fine German French.
Kirsch emerging presently from the neighbourhood of the hold where
he had been bellowing instructions intermingled with polyglot oaths to
the ship's men engaged in selecting the passengers' luggage, came to
give an account of himself to his brother interpreters. He informed them
that the carriage belonged to a Ahab from Calcutta and Jamaica,
enormously rich, and with whom he was engaged to travel; and at this
moment a young gentleman who had been warned of the bridge between
the paddle-boxes, and who had dropped thence on to the roof of Lord
Methuselah's carriage, from which he had made his way over other
carriages and imperials until he had clambered on to his own, descended
thence and through the window into the body of the carriage to the
applause of the couriers looking on.

VANITY AIR.
nearly opposite to the Earl of Breaches and his family, whose proceedings
absorbed the Bengalee almost entirely. Both the noble couple looked
rather younger than in the eventful year '15, when Jos remembered to
have seen them at Brussels (indeed he always gave out in India that he
was intimately acquainted with them). Ldy Caracas's hair which was
then dark was now a beautiful golden auburn, whereas Lord Crassus's
whiskers, formerly red, were at present of a rich black with purple and
green reflections in the light. But changed as they were, the moments
of the noble pair occupied Jos's mind entirely. The presence of a lord
fascinated him, and he could look at nothing else.
Those people seem to interest you a good deal,'' ssid Dobbin,
laughing and watching him. Amelia too laughed. She was in a stra
bonnet with black ribbons, und otherwise dressel in mourning: but the
little bustle and holiday of the journey pleased and excited her, and she
looked particularly happy.
 What a heavenly day,'' Emmy said, and added, with great originality,
ee I hope we shall have a calm passage.''
Jos waves his hand, scornfudly glancing at the same time under his
eyelids and the great folks opposite.  If you had made the voyages ve
l,'' he said, ''you wouldn't much care about the weather.'' But
nevertheless, traveller as he was, he passed the night carefully sick in his
craig, where his courier tended him with brandy-and-water and every
luxury.
In due time this happy party landed at the quays of Rotterdam, whence
they were transported by another steamer to the city of Cologne. Here
the carriage and the family took to the shore, and Jos was not a little
gratilied to sce lis arrival announced in the Cologne newspapers as INner
Graf Carl von Sedlcy unless Begleitung aus London.' He had his court
dress wiTh him : he had insisted tlt Dobbin should bring his regimental
paraphernalia: he announced that it was his intention to be presented at
some foreign Courts, and pay his respects to the Sovereigns of the countries
which he honoured with a visit.
WIreser the party stopped, and an opportunity was ollered, I. Jo
left his own card and the MAjor's upon ``Our Minister.'' It was with
great difficulty that he could be restrained, for putting on his cooked h.at
and tights to wait upon the eNglish consul at the Free City of JudenstuIt,
when that hospitable functionary asked our travellers to diner. Ile kept
a journal of his voyage, and noted elaborately the detect or excellcencies of
the various runs at which he put up, and of the wines and dish of which
A
he partook.
As for Emmy, she was very happy and pleased. Dobbin used to carry
about for her her stool and sketch-book, and admired the drawings of the
goodnatured little artist, as they never had been admired before. She
sate upon steamer's decks and drew crags and castles, or she mounted
upon donkeys and ascended to ancient robber-towers, attended by her two
ides-de-camp, Georgy and Dobbin. Bhe laughed, and the Major did too,
at his droll figure on donkey-back, with his long legs touching the ground.
He was the interpreter for the party, having a good military knowledge of
the German language :; and he and the delighted George fought the

campaigns of the Rhine and the Palatinate. In the course of a few weeks,
and by assiduously conversing with Herr Kirsch on the box of the car-
ridge., eorgy made prodigious asleep in the knowledge of High Dutch,
and could talk to hotel waiters and postillions in a way that charmed his
mother, and amused his guardian.
Mr. Jos did not much engage in the afternoon excursions of his fellow-
travellers. HIe slept a good deal after dinner, or basked in the harbours of
the pleasant inn-gardens. Pleasant Rhine gardens Air scenes of peace
and sunshine-noble purple mountains, whose crests are reflected in the
magnificent stream-who has ever seen you, that has not a grateful memory
of those scenes of friendly repose and beauty2 To lay down the pen, and
even to think of the beautiful Rhineland makes one happy. At this time
of sumer evening, the cows are trooping down from the hills, losing and
with their bells tingling, to the old town, with its old moats, and gates,
and spires, and chestnut-trees, with long blue shadow stretching over the
grass; the sky and the river below flame in crimson and gold; and the
moon is already out, looking pale towards the sunset. The sun sinks
behind the great castle-crested mountains, the night falls suddenly, the
river grows darker and darker, lights quiver in it from the windows in
the old ramparts, and twinkle peacefully in the villages under the bills on
the opposite shore.
So Jos used to go to sleep a good deal with his bandanna over his free
and be very comfortable, and read all the English news, and every word of
Malignant's admirable newspaper, (my the blessings of nll Englishmen who
have ever been abroad rest on the founders and proprietors of that pirate-
cal print:) and whether he woke or slept his friends did not very much
miss him. Is, they were very happy. They went to the Opera often of
evenings-to those snug, unssuming, dear old operas in the German
towns, where the blessed sits and cries, and knits stockings on the one
side, over against the bourgeoisie on the other; and His transparency the
Duke and his Transparent family, all very fat and good-natured, come and
occupy the great box in the middle; and the it is full of the most elegant
slim-waisted officers with straw-coloured pistachios, and opulence a-day
on full pay. Here it was that Emmy found her delight, and was intro-
ducey For the first time to the wonders of Mozart and Mariposa. The
Major's musical taste has been before alluded to, and his performances on
the flute commended. But perhaps the chief pleasure he had in these
operas was in watching Emmy's rapture while listening to them. A new
world of love and beauty broke upon her when she was introduced to those
living compositions : this lady had the deepest and finest sensibility, and
how could she be indifferent when she heard Mozart The tender parts
of Don Juan awakened in her raptures so exquisite that she would ask herself
when she went to say her prayers of a night, whether it was not wicked to
fecl ao much delight as that with which `Verdi Cnrino '' and ``Patti Patti''
filled her gentle little bosom? But the Major, whom she consulted upon
this hand, as her theological adviser (and who himself had a pious and
reverent soul), said that for his part, every beauty of art or nature made
him thankful as well as happy; and that the pleasure to be had in listen-
ing to fine music, as in looking at the stars in the sky, or at a beautiful

landscape or picture, was a benefit for which we might thank Heaven as
sincerely as for any other worldly blessing. And in reply to some faint
objections of Mrs. Amelia's (taken from certain theological works like the
Wnsherwoman of Pinochle Common'' and others of that school, with which
Mrs, Osborne had been furnished during her life at Bromptou) he told her
in Eastern fable of the Owl who thought that the sunshine was unbearable
for the eyes, and that the Nightingale was a most overrated bird. ` It is
one's nature to sing and the other's to hoot,'' he said, laughing, `` and with
such a sweet voice as you have yourself, you must belong to the Bulbul
faction.''
I like to dwell upon this period of her life, and to think that she was
cheerful and happy. YOu see she has not had too much of that sort of
existence as yet, and has not fallen in the way of means to educate her
tastes or her intelligence. She has been domineered over hitherto h
vulgar intellect. It is the lot of many a woman. and as every one of
the dear sex is the rival of the rest of her kind, timidity passes for folly
in their charitable judgments; and gentleness for dulness; and silence-
which is but timid denial of the unwelcome assertion of ruling folks,
and tacit protestantism-above all, finds no mercy at the hands of the
female Inquisition. Thus, my dear and civilised reader, if you and I were
to find ourselves this evening in a society of greengrocers, let us say; it is
probable that our conversation would not be brilliant; if, on the other
hand, a greengrocer should find himself at your refined and polite tea-
table, where everybody was saying witty things, and everybody of fashion
and repute tearing her friends to pieces in the most delightful manner, it
is possible that the stranger would not be very talkative, and by no means
interesting or interested.
And it must be remembered, that this poor lady had never met a gentle-
man in her life until this present moment. Perhaps those are rarer per-
sonages than some of us think for. Which of us can point out many such
in his circle-men whose ais are generous, whose truth is constant, and
not only constant in its kind but elevated in its degree; whose want of
meanness makes them simple: who can look the world honestly in the
face with an equal manly sympathy for the great and the small? We all
know a hundred whose coats are very well made, and a score who have
excellent . manners, and one or two happy beings who are what they call,
in the inner circles, and he shot into the very centre and bull's eye of the
fashion; but of gentlemen how many? Let us take a little scrap of paper
and each make out his list.
My friend the Major I write, without any doubt, in mine. He had
very long legs, n yellow face, and a slight lisp, which at first is rather
ridiculous. bUt his thoughts were just, his brains were fairly good, his
life was honest and pure, and his heart warm and humble. lIe certainly
had very large hands and feet, which the two George Osborne used to
caricature and laugh at; and their jeers and laughter perhaps led poor
little Emmy astray as to his worth. But had we not all been misled
about our heroes, and change our opinions a hundred times Emmy,
in this happy time, found that hers underwent a very great change in
respect of the merits of the MAjor.

Perhaps it was the happiest time of both their lives indeed, if they did
but know it-and who does WHich of us cnn point out and say that was
the culmination-that was the summit of human joy? But at all events,
this couple were very decently contented and enjoyed as pleasant a summer
tour as any pair that left England that year. Georgy was always present
at the play, but it was the Major who put Emmy's shawl on after the
entertainment; and in the walks ad excursions the young lad would be
on a head, and up a tower-stair or a tree, whilst the soberer couple were
below, the Major smoking his cigar with great acidity and constancy,
whilst Emmy sketched the site of the ruin. It was on this very town
that IN, the present writer of a history of which every word is true, had the
pleasure to see the first, and to make their acquaintance.
It was at the little comfortable Grand Ducal town of Pumperickel (that
very place where Sir Pitt Crawley and been so distinguished as an battle';
but that was in early early nys, and before the news of the battle of
Austerlitz sent all the English diplomatists in Germany to the right about)
that I first saw Colonel Dobbin and his party. They had arrived with the
carriage and courier at the Erbprinz hotel, the best of the town, and the
welle party dined at the table elite. Everybody remarked the majesty
of Ios, and the knowing way in which he sipped, or ruler sucked, the
Johannisberger, which he ordered for dinner. The little boy, too, we
observed, had a famous appetite, and consumed schinken, and beaten, and
kartotleln, and cranberry jam, and salad, and pudding, and roast fowls,
and swectneats, with a gnllantry that did honour to his nation. After
about fifteen dishes, he concluded the repast with dessert, some of which
he been carried out of doors; for some young gentlemen at table, amused
with his coolness and gallant free and casy manner, induced him to pocket
a handful of marooned, which he discussed on his way to the theatre,
whithcr everybody went in the cheery social little German place. The
lady in black, the boy's mamma, laughed and bushel, and looked exceed-
singly pleased and shy as the dinner went on, and at the various feats and
instances of espilerie on the part of her son. The Colonel-for so he
became very soon afterwards-I remember joked the boy with a great
deal of grave fun, pointing out dishes which he had'a tried, and entreat-
ing him not to baulk his appetite, bUt to have a second supply of this or
that.
It was what they call a gat-rolle night nt the loyal Grand Ducal
Tumperuickclisch Hof,-or Court theatre; and Made Schroeder bDevricnt,
then in the blood of her beauty nl genius, performed the part of the
heroine in the wonderful opera of Fidelio. From our places in the stalls
we could see our for friends of the table d'Idle, in the love which
Schwendler of the Erbprinz kept for lis bEst guests : and I could not
help remarking the effect which the magnificent actress and music pro-
ducey upon Mrs., Osborne, for so we had heard the stout gentleman in the
stanchions call her. During the astonishing Chorus of the Prisoners over
with the delightful voice of the actress rose and soared in the most
raviehirg harmony, her face wore such an expression of wonder and de-
light that it struck even little Fips, the last attach, who dialed

out, as he fixed his glass upon her, `Gay, it really does one good to see
a woman capable of that start of excitement.'' And in the Prison
Scene where Fidelio, rushing to her husband, cries :' Nichts nichts mein
Forestall,'' she fairly lost herself and covered her face with her handkerchief.
Every woman in the house was snivelling at the time: but I suppose it was
because it was predestined that I was to write this particular lady's
memoirs that I remarked her.
The next day they re another piece of Beethoven. ''Die Schlucht bei
Vittoria.'' Malbrook is introduced at the beginning of the performance, as
indicative of the brisk advance of the French Army. Then coe drums,
trumpets, thunder of artillery, and groans of the dying, and at last in a
grand triumphant swell, `' God save the king '' is performed.
There may have been a score of Englishes in the house, but at the
burst of that beloved and well-known music, everyone of them, we young
fellows in the stalls, Sir John and Lady Bullninster (who had taken a
house at Pumpernickel for the education of their nine children), the
fat gentleman with the stanchions, the long Major in white duck browsers,
and the lady with the little boy upon who he was so sweet; cen
Kirsch, the courier in the gallery, stool bolt upright in their places, and
proclaimed themselves to be members of the denr old British nation. As
for Tapeworm, the Secretary of Legation, he rose up in his box and
bowed and simpered, as if he would represent the whole empire. Tape-
worm was nephew and heir of old Marsh Tiptoff, who has been
introduced in this story as General Tiptoff, just before Waterloo, who was
Colonel of the -th regiment in which Major Dobbin served, and who
died in this year full of honours, and of an aspic of ploer's eggs; when
the regiment was graciously given by his Majesty to Colonel Sir Michael
O'Dowd, K.C.B., who had commanded it in many glorious fields.
Tapeworm must have met with Colonel Dobbin at the house of the
Colonel's Colonel, the Marshal, for he recognised him on this night at the
theatre; and with the utmost condescension, his Majesty's minister came
over from his own box, and publicly shook hands with his new-found
friend.
``Look at the infernal sly boots of n Tapeworm,'' Fips whispered,
examining his Chief from the stalls.  Wherever there's a pretty woman
he always twists himself in.'' And I wonder what were diplomatists made
for but for that ?
Have I the honour of addressing myself to Mrs. Dobbin,'' asked
the Secretary, with a most insinuating grin.
Georgy burst out laughing, and said `` By Jove, that is a good 'un.''-
Emmy and the Major brushed: we saw them from the stalls.
 This lady is Mrs. George Osborne,'' said the Major, '` and this is her
brother, Mr. Selley, a distinguished officer of the Bengal Civil Service:
permit me to introduce him to your lordship.''
MIy lord nearly sent Jos off his legs, with the most fascinating smile.
`'Are you going to stop in Pumpernickel,'' he said.  It is a dull place:
but we want some nice people, and we would try and make it a
agreeable to you. Mr.-Alum-Mrs.-Oho. I shall do myself the
honour of calling upon you to-morrow at your inn.''-And he went away

The performance over, the young fellows lounged about the lobbies, and
we saw the society take its departure. The Duchess Dowager went of
in her jingling old conch, attended by two faithful and withered old maids
of honour, and a little snuff spindle-shanked gentleman in waiting, in a
brown casey and a green coat covered with orders-of which the star and
the grand yellow gordon of the order of 9unit Michael of Pumpernickel
was most conspicuous. The drums rolled, the guards saluted, and the old
carriage drove away.
Then came his Transparency the Duke and Transparent family, with
his great officers of state and household. IIe bowed serenely to every-
body. And amid the saluting of the guards, and the firing of the
torches of the running footmen, clad in scarlet, the Transparent carriages
drove away to the old Ducal Schloss, with its towers and pinnacles stand-
in on the Schlossberg. Everybody in Pumpernickel knew everybody.
566
VANITY FAIR.
No sooner was a foreigner seen there, another Minister of Foreign Affairs,
or some other great or small officer of state, went round to the lrbprinz,
and found out the name of the new arrivals.
We watched them, too, out of the theatre. Tapeworm had just walked
off, enveloped in his cloak, with which his gigantic chasseur was always in
attendance, and looking as much as possible like Don Jun. The prime
Minister's lady had just squeezed herself into her sedan, and her daughter,
the charming Ida, had put on her clash anl clogs: when the English party
came out, the boy yawning drearily, the Major taking great pains in keep-
in the shawl over Mrs. Osborne's head, and Mr. Sedley looking grand,
with a crush opera-hat on one side of his head, and his hand in the stomach
of a voluminous white waistcoat. We took off our hats to our equality-
ances of the table d'lie, and the lady, in return, presented us with a little
smile and a curtsey, for which everybody might be thankful.
The carriage from the inn, under the superintendence of the bustling
MIr. Kirsch, was in waiting to convey the party; but the fat man said he
would walk, and smoke his cigar on his way homewards; so the other
three, with nods and smiles to us, went without Mr. Sedley. Hirsch,
with the cigar-case, following in his master's wake.
We all walked together, and talked to the stout gentleman about the
agreiueus of the place. It was very agreeable for the English. There were
shooting-parties and battles; there was a plenty of halls and enter-
tainments at the hospitable Court; the society was generally good,; the
theatre excellent, and the living cheap.
And our Minister seems a most delightful and afable person,'' our new
friend suid.  WIth such a representative, and-and a good medical man,
I can fancy the place to be most eligible. Good night, gentlemen.'' And
Jos created up the stairs to edward, followed hy kirsch with a flambeau.

on:a time in the town.

UCIHI polite behaviour as that of
Lord Tapeworm did not fail to
have the most favourable effect
upon Mr. Selley's mind, and the
very next morning, at breakfast,
he pronounced his opinion that
Pumpernickel was the pleasantest
little place of any which they had
visited on their tour. Jos's
motives and artifices were not
very difficult of comprehension:
and Dobbin laughed in his sleeve,
like a hypocrite as he was, when
he found by the knowing air of
the Civilian and the off-hand
manner in which the latter talked
about Tapeworm Castle, and the
other members of the family, that
Jos had been up already in the
morning, consulting his travel-
ling Peerage. as, he had seen
the Right honourable the Earl
of Being, his lordship's Father:
he was sure he had, he had met
him at-at the Levee-didn't Do remember and when the diplomatic
called on the party, faithful to his promise, Jos received him with such a
salute and honours as were seldom accorded to the little Envoy. He
winked at Kirsch on his Excellency's arrival, and that emissary instructed
beforehand, went out and superintendent an entertainment of cold meats,
jellies, and other delicacies, brought in upon ways, and of which Mr. Jos
absolutely insisted that his noble guest should partake.
Tapeworm, so long as he could have an opportunity of admiring the
bright eyes of Mrs. Osborne (whose freshness of complexion bore daylight
remarkably well) was not ill pleased to accept any invitation to stay in
568
uNITY FIR.
MIr. Sedley's lodgings; he put one or two dexterous questions to him
about India and the dancing-girls there; asked Amelia about that beauty-
ful boy who had been with her, and complimented the astonished little
woman upon the prodigious sensation which she had made in the house;
nnl tried to fascinate Dobbin by talking of the late war, and the exploits of
the Pumperniekel contingent under the command of the hereditary Prince,
now Duke of Pumpernickel.
Lord Tapeworm inherited no little portion of the family allantry, and
it was his happy belief, that almost every woman upon whom he himself
cast friendly eyes, was in love with him. He left Emmy under the per-
season that she was slain by his wit and attractions, and went home to
his lodgings to write a pretty little note to her. She was not fascinated;
only puzzled by his grinning, his simmering, his scented cambric hand-
kerchief, and his high-heeled laequered boots. She did not understand
one half the compliments which he paid; she had never, in her small
experience of mankind, met a professional lady's man as yet, and looked
upon my lord as something curious rather than pleasant; and if she did
not admire, certainly wondered nt him. Jos, on the contrary, was de-
lighted.  1Now very able his Lordship is,'' he said;  IIow very kind
of his Lordship to say he would send his medical man. Kirsch, you will
carry our cards to the Count e Schliisselback directly: the Major and
I will have the greatest pleasure in paying our respects at Court as soon
as possible. lut out my uniform, Kirsch,-both our uniforms. It is a
mark of politeness which every English gentleman ought to show to the
countries which he visits, to pay his respects to the sovereigns of those
countries as to the representatives of his own.''
When Tapeworm's doctor cnbc, Doctor von Glauber, Body PHysician
to H.S.H. the Duke, hec speedily convinced Jos that the Pumpernickel
mineral springs and the Doctor's particular treatment would infallibly
restore the Bengalees to youth and slimness. ` Dere came here last year,''
he said,  Sheneral Bulkeley, an English Sheneral, vice so pic as you, Sir.
I sent him back quite tin after three months, and he danced id Buroness
Glauber at the end of two,''
Jos's mind was made up, the springs, the doctor, the Court, and the
Charge d' Affaires convinced him, and he proposed to spend the autumn in
these delightful quarters.-Anl punetual to his word, on the next day the
Charge d' Affaires presented Jos and the Major to Victor Aurelius XVI.,
being conducted to their audience with that sovereign by the Count de
tSchliuisselbaek, Marshal of the Court.
They were straightaway invited to dinner at Court, and their intention of
staying in the town being announced, the politics ladies of the whole
town instantly called upon Mrs. Osborne; and is not one of these, how-
ever poor they might be, was under the rank of a lBaroness, Jos's delight
was beyond expression. He wrote off to Chutney at the Club to say that
the Service was highly appreciated in Germany, that he was going to show
his friend, the Count de Schlisselback, how to stick a pig in the Indian
fashion, and that his august friends, the Duke and Duchess, were every-
thing that was kind and civil.

Emmy, too, was presented to the august family, and as mourning is not
united in Court on certain days, she appeared in a pink crape dress,
with a diamond ornament in the corsage, presented to her by her brother,
and she looked so pretty in this costume that the Duke and Court (putting
out of the question the Major, who had scarcely ever seen her before in an
evening dress, and vowed that she did not look five-and-twenty) all admired

In this dress she walked n Polonaise with Major Dobbin at a Court-

Germany.
Pumperuickel stands in the midst of a happy valley, through which
sparkle-to mingle with the line somewhere, but I have not the map at
and to say exactly at what point-the fertilising stream of the Pump.
In some places the river is big enough to support a ferry-boat, in others
to in a mill; in Pumpernickel itself, the last transparency but three, the
great and renowned Victor Aurelius NIV., built a magnificent bridge, on
which his own statue rises, surrounded by water-nymphs and emblems of
victory, peace and plenty; he has his foot on the neck of a prostate lurk

relief of Vienna by Sobicski,-but, quite undisturbed by the agonies of that
prostrate Homestand, who writes at his feet in the most ghastly manner
-the Prince smiles blindly, and points with his truclcon in trio direction
of the Aurelius Platz, where hc beg to crew a new palace that would
have been the wonder of his age,had th: great-fouled 1'rice but funds to
complete it. But the completion of Mlonplaisir (lllziir the honest
(German folks call it) was stop.d for lack of realy money, and it and its
park and garden are now in rather a fdd condition, l not more than
ten times big enough to ascendant the Court of the reigning sovereign.
The gardens were arranged to emulate those of Versailles,  and amidst
the terraces and groves there arc somo huge allegorical waterworks still,
which spout and froth stupendously upon fete-days, and fright one
with their enormous aquatic insurrections. There is the Troplonius' case
in which, by some artifice, the leaden britons are made not only to spout
water, but to play the most dreadful groans out of their lead conchs-
there is the Nymph-bath and the liagar cataraet, which the people of
the neighbourhood admire beyond expression, when they come to the
yearly fair at the opening of the Chamber, or to the fetus with which the
happy little nation still celebrates the birth-days and marriage-days of its
princely governors.
Then from all the towns of the Duchy which stretches for nearly ten
miles,-from Volume, which lies on its western frontier bidding defiance

where his dominions are separated by the Pump river from those of the

the farms and the mills along the Pump, come troops of people in red

petticoats and velvet head-dresses, or with three-cornered hats and pipes in
their mouths, who flock to the Residenz and share in the pleasures of the
fair and the festivities there. Then the theatre is open for nothing, then
the waters of Monblaisir begin to play (it is lucky that there is company
to behold them for one would be afraid to see them alone)-then there
come mountebanks and riding troops (the way in which his Trssarenc
was fascinated by one of the horse-riders, is well known, and it is
believed that ILa Petite wondered, as she was called, was a spy in the
French interest), and the delighted people are permitted to march through
room after room of the Grand Ducal palace, and admire the slippery floor,
the rich hangings,and the spittoons at the doors of all the innumerable
chambers. There is one Pavilion ast Mfonblaisir which Aurelius Victor
XV. had arranged-a great Prince but too fond of pleasure-and which
I am told is a perfect wonder of licentious elegance. It is painted with
the story of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the table works in and out of the
room by means of a windlass so that the company was served without any
intervention of domestic. But the place was shut np by Barbara,
Aurelius XV.'s widow, a severe and devout Princess of the House of
lOkum and Regent of the Duchy during her son's glorious minority, and
after the death of her husband, cut of in the pride of his pleasures.
The theatre of Pumnperuiekel is known and famous in that quarter of
Germany. lt languislel a little when the present Duke in his youth
insisted upon having his own operas played there, and it is said one day,
in a fury from his place in the orchestra, when he attended a reversal,
broke a bassoon on the end of the Chapel Master, who was conducting,
and led to slow; and during which time the Duchess Sophia role
domestic comedies which must have been very dreary to witness. But
the Prince executes his music in private now, and the Duchess only goes
away her plays to the foreigners of distinction who visit her kind little
Court.
It is conducted with no small comfort and splendor. WHen there are
balls, though there may be four hundred people at supper, there is a servant
in scarlet and lace to attend upon every four, and every one is served on
siler. There are festivals and entertainments going continually on; and
the Duke has his chamberlains and queries, and the Duchess her mistress
of the wardrobe and ladies of honour just like any other and more potent
potentates.
The Constitution is or was a moderate despotism, tempered by a
Chamber that might or might not be elected. I neer certainly could
hear of its sitting in my time at Pumpernickel. The Prime Minister had
logging in a second floor; and the Foreign Secretary occupied the com-
portable lodgings over Zwieback's Consistory. The army consisted offs
magnificent band that also did duty on the stage, where it was quite
pleasant to see the worthy fellows marching in turkish dresses with rouge
on and wooden scimetars, or as Roman warriors with ophicleiles and
trombones,-to see them again, I say, at night, after one had listened to
them all the morning in the Aurelius Plats, where they performed opposite
the Caf where we breakfast. bEsides the band, there was a rich and

numerous staff of officers, and, I believe, a few men. Besides the regular
sentries, three or four men, hailed as hussars, used to do duty at the
Place, but I never saw them on horseback, and u fit, what was the use
of cavalry in a time of profound peace -and whether the deuce should

week, the Court graciously received once, so that a man's life might in
fact be a perfect round of pleasure in the unpretenling umpernickel way.
That there were feuds in the place, no one can deny. Politics ran very
high at Pumpernickel, and parties were very bitter. There was the
Strumnff function and the Lederlung party, the one supported by our Envoy
and tie other by the bench Charg d' Affaires, M de Marconi. Indeed
it sufficed for our Minister to stand up for MInnie Strumpff, who was
clearly the greatest singer of the two, and had three more notes in her
voice than Madame Iederlung her rival-it sufficed, I say, for our
Minister to advance at opinion to have it instantly contradicted by
the French diplomats.
Everybody in the town was ranged in one or other of these factions.
The Lelerlung was a prcettyish little creature certainly, and her voice,
(that there was of it,) was very sweet, and there is no doubt that the
Strumpff was not in her first youth and beauty, and certainly too stout;
when she came on in the last scene of the Bonnambula for instance in her
night-clemise with a lamp in her hand, and had to go out of the window,
and pass over the plane of the mill, it was all she could do to squeeze
out of the window, and the plank used to bend and creak again under her
weight-but how she poured out the finale of the opera and with what
a burst of feeling she rushed into lEaving's arms-lost fit to smother
him Whereas the little Lederlung-but a truce to this gossip-the
fact is, that these two women were the two flags of the French and the
English party at umpermnickel, and the society was divided in its
allegiance to those two great nations.
We had on our side the Home Minister, the Master of the cLose, the
Duke's Private Secretary, and the PRince'a Tutor: whereas of the French
party were the Foreign Minister, the Commander-in-chief's Lady, who
had served under Napoleon, and the Hof-Marschll and his wife, who was
glad enough to get the fashions from Paris, and always had them and her
caps by M. de Macau's courier. The Secretary of his Chnuceery was
little Brigade, a young fellow, as malicious as Satan, and we made
caricatures of Taneworm in all the albums of the place.
Their head-quarters and table d'h6te were establishment the Parser Of,

obliged to be civil in public, yet they cut at each other with epigrams

home a despatch to his government, without a most savage series of
attacks upon his rival. or instance, on our side we would write, `` The
interest of Great Britain in this place, and throughout the whole of
Germany, are repelled by the continuance in office of the present French
convoy; this man is of a character s infamous that he will stick at no
falsehood, or hesitate at no crime, to attain his ends. IIe poisons the
mind of the Court against the English minister, represents thc conduct of
Great Britain in the most odious and atrocious light, and is unhappily
backed by a minister whose ignorance and necessities are ns notorious as
his influence is fatal.'' On their side they would say, `'M. de Tapeworm
continues his system of stupid insular arrogance and vulgar falsehood
against the greatest nation in the world. YEsterday he was heard to
peak lightly of Her Royal Highness Madame the dUchess of Berry: oua
former occasion he insulted the heroic Duke of Angouleme, and dared to
insinuate that II.R.II. the Duke of Orleans was conspiring against the
august throne of the lilies. His gold is propagated in every direction
which his stupid meuaces fail to frighten. By one and the other, he has
won over creatures of the Court here,-and, in fine, Rumpernickel will not
be quiet, Germany tranquil, France respected, or Europe content, until
this poisonous viper be crushed under heel'' and so on. When one side
or the other had written any particularly spicy despatech, news of it was
sure to s out.
Before the winter was far advanced it is actually on record that Emy
took a night and received company with great propriety and modesty.
She had a French master who complimented her upon the purity of her
accent and her facility of learning; the fact is she has learned long age
and grounded herself subsequently in the grammar so as to be able to
teach it to George; anl MAdame Strunpff came to give her lessons in
singing, which she performed so well and with such a true voice that the
MInor's windows, who had lodgings opposite under the Prime minister,
were always open to hear the lesson. Some of the German ladies, wo
are very sentimental and simple in their tastes, fell in love with her and
began to call her du at once. These are trivial details, but they relate to
happy times. The Major made himself George's tutor, and real Cesar
and mathematics with him, and they had a German master and rode out
of evenings by the side of Emmy's marriage-she was always too timid, and
made a dreadful outcry at the slightest disturbance on horseback. So she
drove about with one of her year German friends, and Jos asleep on the
back-seat of the barouche.
He was becoming very sweet upon the Griffin Fanny de Butterbrod, a
very gentle tender-hearted and unassuming young creature, a Congress and
Countess in her own right, but with scarcely ten pounds per year to
her fortune, and Fanny for her part declared that to be Amelia's sister
was the greatest delight that heaven could bestow on her, and Jos might
have put a Countess's shield and coronet by the side of his own arms on his
carriage and forks; when-when events occurred, and those grand fees
given upon the marriage of the Hereditary Prince of Pumpernickel with th
lovely Princess Amelia of Humour-Schlippensehloppen took place.
A NOVEL WITHOUT A IIEB0.
At this festival the magnificence displayed was such as had not been
shown in the little German place since the days of the prodigal Victor XIV.,
All the neighbouring princes, Princesses, and Grandees were invited to
the feast. Beds rose to half-a-crown per night in Pumpernickel and the
army was exhausted in providing guards of honour for the Highnesses,
Securities, aul Excellencies, who arrived from all quarters. The Princess
was married by proxy, at her father's residence, by the Count de Sells-
scelbaek. Snub-boxes were given easy in profusion (as we learned from
the Court-jewellcr, who sold und afterwards bought them again), und
bushels of the Order of Saint Michael of Pumperuickel were sent to the
nobles of the Court, while hampers of the cordons and decorations of the
Wheel of St. Catherine of cllippenaclloppen were brought to ours. The
French envoy got both. '` He is covered with ribbons like a prize cart-horse,''
Tapeworm said, who was not allowed by the rules of his service to the
any decorations: '`Lct him have the cordons; but with whom is the victory''
The fact is, it was a triumph of British diplomacy: the French party
having proposed and tried their utmost to carry a marriage with a Princess
of the house of Potztauscnd-Donncrwetter, whom, as a matter of course,
we opposed.
Everybody was asked to the fees of the marriage. Garlands and
triumphal arches were hung across the rod to welcome the young bride.

while that in the Artillery Place frothed with beer. he great waters
played; and poles were put up in the park and gardens for the happy
peasantry, which they might climb at their leisure, carrying of watches,
silver forks, prize sausages hung with pink ribbon, &e., at the top.
Georgy got one, wrenching it off, having swarmed up the pole to the
delight of the spectators, and sliding down with the rapidity of a fall of
water. But it was for the glory's sake merely. The boy gave the usage
to a peasant, who had very nearly seized it, and stood at the foot of the
mast, blubbering, because he was unsuccessful.
At the French Chnneellerie they had six more lampions in their illumi-
nation than our's had; but our transparency, which represented the young
Couple advancing, and Discord flying away, with the most ludicrous like-
ness to the French ambassador, beat the French picture hollow; and I
have no doubt got Tapeworm the advancement and the Cross of the Bath,
which he subsequently attained.
Crowds of foreigners arrived for the fees : and of English of course.
Besides the Court balls, public balls were given at the Town lIall and the
Reroute, and in the former place there was a room for trent-et-guarantee
and roulette established, for the week of the festivities only, and by one of
the great Geran companies from Ems or Aix-la-Chapelle. The officers or
inhabitants of the town were not allowed to play at these games, but
strangers, peasants, ladies were admitted, and anyone who chose to lose
or win money.
That little scpegrace Gcorgy Osborne amongst others, whose pockets
ere nlwy full of dollars, and whose relations were away at the grand
festival of the Court, came to the Stadthaus' ball in company of his uncle'ae

courier, Mr. Kirsch, and having only seeped into a play-room at Baden
Baden when he hung on Dobbin's arm, and were, of course, he was not
permitted to gamble, came eagerly to this part of the entertainment, and
hankered round the tables where the companies and the punters were at work.
Women were playing; they were masked, some of them; this license was
allowed in these wild times of carnival.
A woman with light hair, in a low dress, by no means so fresh as it had
been, and with a black mask on, through the eyelets of which her eyes
twinkled strangely, was seated at one of the roulette-tables with a card
and a pin, and a couple of florins before her. As the croupier called on
the colour and number, she pricked on the card with great care and reg-
clarity, and only ventured her money on the colours after the red or
black had come up a certain number of times. It was strange to look at
her.
But in spite of her care and assiduity she guessed wrong, and the last
two florins followed each other under the croupier's take, as he cried out
with his inexorable voice, the winning colour and number. She gave
sigh, a shrug with her shoulders, which were already too much out of her
own, and dashing the pin through the card on to the table, sat thru-
inning it for a while. Then she looked round her, and saw Georgy's honest
face staring at the scene. the little scampl what business had he to be
there
When she saw the of, at whose face she looked hard through her
shining eyes and minsk, she said, `` Monsieur n'est psjoueur.''
Non, Made,'' said the boy: but she must have known, from his
accent of what country he was, for she answered him with a slight foreign
tone. `You have nevare played-will you do me a little' favor''
 What is it'' and Georgy, blushing again. Mr. Kirsch was at work
for his part at the rouge et noir, and did not see his young master.
`Ply this for me, if you please, put it on my number, any number.''
and she took from her bosom a purse, and out of it a gold piece, the only
coin there, and she put it into George's hand. The boy laughed, and did
as he was bid.
It came up the number sure enough. There is a power that arranges
that, they say, for beginners.
Thank you,'' said she, pulling the money towards her; `` thank ou.

My name's Osborne,'' said Georgy, and was fingering in his s
pockets for dollars, and just about to make a trial, when the Major,
in his uniform, and Jos, en Marquis, from the Court ball, made their
appearance. Other people finding the entertainment stupid, and preferring
the fun at the Stadthnus, hal quieted the Palace ball earlier; but it is
probable the Major and Jos hd gone home and found the boy's absence,
for the former instantly went up to him, and taking him by the shoulder,
pulled him briskly back from the place of temptation. Then, looking round
the room, he saw Hirsch employed as we have said, and going up to him,
asked how he dared to bring Mr, George to such a place.
``Laissez-moi trailer,'' said Mr. Kirach, very much excited by play

and wine. ``Il fact a'mauser, parallel. Je ne sis pas aa service de
Monsieur,''
Seeing his condition the Major did not choose to argue with the man;
but contented himself with drawing away George, ad asking Jos if he
would come away. He was standing close by the lady in the mask, who
was playing with pretty good luck now; and looking on much interested
at the game.
'Had 'not you better come, Jos,'' the Major said, `with George
and me''
 I'In stop and go home with that rascal, Kirsch,'' Jos said; and for
the same reason of modesty, which he thought ought to be preserved
before the boy, Dobbin did not here to remonstrate with Jos, but left him
and walked lome with Georgy.

way home.

t Give me your word of honour as a gentleman, that you never will,''
 WHy I'' said the boy: `' It seems very good In,'' And, in a very
eloquent and impressive manner, the Major showed him why he should 'nt,
and would have enforced his precepts by the example of George's own father,
and he liked to say anything that should reflect on the other's memory.
When he had housed him he went to bed, and saw his light, in the little
room outside of Amelia's, presently disappear. Amelia's followed half an
hour afterwards. I don't know what made the Major note it so
accurately.
Jos, however, remained hind over the play-table; he was no gambler,
but not averse to the little excitement of the sport now and then; and he
had some Napoleons thinking in the embroidered pockets of his court
waistcot. Ie put down one over the fair shoulder of the little gambler
before him, and they won. She made a little movement to make room
for him by her side, and just took the skirt of her down from a vacant
chair there.
Come and give me goo luck,'' she said, still in a foreign accent, quite
different from that frank and perfectly English  Thank you,'' with which
she had saluted Gcorgy's cop in her favour. The portly gentleman,
looking round to see that nobody of rank observed him, sat down; he
muttered-'`Ah, really, well now, Got bless my soul, I'm very fortunate;
I'm sure to give you good fortune,''-and other words of compliment fund
confusion.
Do you play much'' the foreign mask said.
'I put a Nap or two down,'' said Jos, with a superb air, flinging down
a gold piece.
eYes; a nap after dinner,'' said the mask, early. But Jos looking
frightened, she continued, in her pretty French accent, ` You do to play
to win. No more do l. I play to forget, but I cannot.  I cunot forget
old times, Monsieur. Your little nephew is the image of his father ; and
you-you are not changed-but yes, you are. Every body changes

fashion at present prevailing, and only to hint at the existence of wicked-
ness in a light, easy, and agreeable manner, so that nobody's fine feelings
may be offender. I defy any one to say that our Becky, who has certainly
some vices, has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and
inoflensive manner. In describing this siren, singing and smiling, coaxing
and caioling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers all round, has

it is labour lost to look into it ever so curiously. They look pretty
enough when they sit upon a rock, changing their harps and combing
their hair, and sing, and beckon to you to come and hold the looking-
glass; but when they sink into their native element, depend on it those
mermaids are about no good, and we had best not examine the fiendish
marine cannibals, retelling and feasting on their wretched pickled victims.
And so, when Becky is out of the way, be sure that she is not particularly
well employed, and that the less that is said about her doings is in get
the better.
If we were to give a full account of her proceedings during a couple of
years that followed after the Curzon Street catastrophe, there might be
some reason for people to say this book was improper. The actions of
very vain, heartless, pleasure-seeking people are very often improper (as
are many of yours, my friend with the grave face and spotless reputation;
-but that is merely by the way); and what are those of a woman without
faith-or love-or character And I am inclined to think that there was
period in Mrs. Becky's life, when she was seized, not by remorse, but by
a kind of despair, and absolutely neglected her person, and did not even
care for her reputation.
This statement and degradation did not take place all at once: it was
brought about by degrees, after her calamity, and after many struggles t
keep up-as a man who goes overboard hangs on to a spar whilst any
hope is left, and then flings it away and goes down, when he finds that
struggling is in vain.
She lingered about London whilst her husband was making preparations
for his departure to his seat of government: and it is believed made more
than one attempt to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, and to work
upon his feelings which she had almost enlisted in her favour. As Sir
Pitt and Mr. Denham were walking down to the House of Commons, the
latter spied Mrs. Rawdon in a black veil, and lurking near the palace of
the legislature. Bhe sneaked away when her eyes met those of Denham,
and indeed never succeeded in her designs upon the Baronet.
Probably Lady Jane interposed. Have heard that she quite astonished
her husband by the spirit which she exhibited in this quarrel, and her
determination to disown Mrs. Becky. Of her own movement, she invited
Rawdon to come and stop in Gaunt Street until his departure for
Coventry Island, knowing that with him for a guard Mrs. Becky would
not try to force her door: and she looked curiously at the superscriptions
of all the letters which arrived for Sir Pitt, lest he and his sister-in-law
should be corresponding. Not but that Rebecca could have written had
she a mind: but she did not try to see or to write to Pitt at his own
house, and after one or two attempts consented to his demand that the
correspondence regarding her conjugal differences should be carried on by
lawyers only.
The fact was, that Pitt's mind had been poisoned against her. A short
time after Lord Steyne's accident Denham had been with the Baronet;
and given him such a biography of Mrs. Becky as had astonished the
member for queen's Crawley. He knew everything regarding her: who
her father was; in what year her mother danced at the Opera; what had
1 NOEL WROTE A HER0O.
579
been her previous history, and what her conduct during her married life:
-as I have no doubt that the greater part of the story was false and dic-
stated by interested malevolence, it shall not be repeated here. But Becky
was left with a sad sad reputation in the esteem of a country gentleman
and relative who had been once rather partial to her.
The revenues of the Governor of Coventry island are not large. n part
of them were set aside by his Excellency for the payment of certain out-
standing debts and liabilities, the charges incident on his high situation
required considerable expense; finally, it was found that he could not
spare to his wife more than three hundred pounds a year, which he pro-
posed to pay to her on an undertaking that she would never trouble
him. Otherwise: scandal, separation, Doctors' Commons would ensue.
But it was Mr. Welham's business, Lord Steyne's business, Rawdon's,
everybody's-to get her out of the country, and hush up a most dis-
agreeable affair.
She was probably so much occupied in arranging there affairs of business
with her husband's lawyers, that she forgot to take any step whatever
about her son, the little Rawdon, and did not even one propose to go
and see him. That young gentleman was consigned to the entire
guardianship of his aunt and uncle, the former of whom had always
possessed a great share of the child's affection. His mamma wrote him
a near letter from Boulogne when she quieted England, in which she
requested him to find his book, and said he was going to take a Conti-
mental tour, during which she would have the pleasure of writing to him
again. But she never did for a year afterwards, and not, indeed, until
Sir Pitt's only boy, always sickly, died of hooping-enough and measles;-
then Rawdon's mamma wrote the most affectionate composition to her
darling son, who was made heir of queen's Crawley by this accident, and
drawn more closely than ever to the kind lady, whose tender heart had
already adopted him. Radon Crawley, then grown a tall, fine lad,
brushed when he got the letter. `Oh Aunt Jane, you are my mother1''
he said; `'`and not-and not that one'' But he wrote back a kind and
respectful letter to Mrs. Rebecca, then living at a boarding-house at
Florence.-But we are advancing matter.
Our darling Becky's first flight was not very far. She perched nou
the French east at Boulogne, that refuge of so much exiled English
innocence ; and there lived in rather a genteel, widowed manner, with a
fense de claire and a couple of rooms, at an hotel. She died at
the table d'Idle, where people thought her very pleasant, and where
she entertained her neighbours by stories of her brother, Sir Pitt, and
her great London acquaintance; talking that easy, fashionable slipslop,
which has so much effect upon certain folks of small breeding. She
passed with many of them for a person of importance; she gave little
tea-parties in her private room, and shared in the innocent amusements
of the place,-in sea-bathing, and in jaunts in open carriages, in strolls on

vANITY FAIR.
But there was nothing in the story, only that Becky was always affable,
casy, and good-natured-and with men especially.
Numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the
season, and Becky had plenty of opportunities of finding out by the
behaviour of her acquaintances of the great London world the opinion of
`society'' as regarded her conduct. One day it was Lady Partlet and
her daughters whom Becky confronted as she was walking modestly on
Boulogne pier, the clips of Albion shining in the distance across the deep
blue sea. Lady artlet mrshalled all her daughters round her with a
sweep of her parasol, and retreated from the pier darting savage glances
at poor little Becky who stood alone there.
On another day the packet came in. It had been blowing fresh, and it
always suited Becky's humour to see the droll woe-bygone faces of the
people as they emerged from the boat. Lady lingstone happened to be
on board this dy. Her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her carriage,
and was greatly exhausted and scarcely fit to walk up the pink from the
ship to the pier. But all her energies rallied the instant she saw Becky
smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet : and giving her a glance of scorn,
such as would have shrivelled up most women, she walked into the
Custom HOuse quite unsupported. Becky only laughed: but I don't
think she liked it. She felt she was alone, quite alone; and the far-off
shining cliffs of England were impassable to her.
The behaviour of the men had undergone too I don't know what change.
Grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity
that was not pleasant. Little Bob Suekling, who was cap in hand to her
three months before, and would walk a mile in the rain to see for her
carriage in the line at Gaunt House, was talking to Fitzroy of the Guards
(Lord IIeehaw's on) one day upon the jetty, as Becky took her walk
there. Little Bobby nodded to her over his shoulder without moving his
hat, and continued his conversation with the heir of Hebrew. Tom Raises
tried to walk into her sitting-room at the in with a cigar in his mouth;
but she closed the door upon him and would have locked it only that his
fingers were inside. She began to feel that she was very lonely indeed.
 If He'd been here,'' she said, `` those cowards would never have dared to
insult me,'' She thought about `` him'' with great sadness, and perhaps
longing-about his honest, stupid, constant kindness and fidelity: his
neer-ceasing obedience; his good humour; his bravery and courage.
Very likely she cried, for he was particularly likely, and had put on a
little extra rouge when she came down to dinner.
She rouge regularly now: and-and her maid got Cognate for her
besides that which was charged in the hotel bill.
Perhaps the insults of the men were not, however, so intolerable to hen
is the sympathy of certain women. Mrs. Crackenbury and Mrs. Wash-
into White passed through Boulogne on their way to Switzerland.
(The party were protected by Colonel Horner, young Beaumoris, and of
course old Crackeubury, and Mrs. White's little girl.) They did not avoid
hcr. They giggled, tackled, battled, condoned, consoled, and patronised
her until they drove her almost wild with rage. To be patronised by ten l

heard Beaumoris's laugh ringing on the star, and knew quite well how to
interpret his hilarity.
It was after this visit that Becky, who had paid her weekly bills,
Becky who had made herself agreeable to every body in the house, who
smiled at the landlady, called the waiters '` Monsieur,'' and paid the cham-
hermaids in politeness and apologies, what far more than compensated for a
little niggardliness in point of money (of which Becky never was free), that
Becky, we say, received a notice to quit from the landlord, who had been
told by some one that she was quite an unfit person to have at his hotel,
where English ladies would not sit down with her. And she was forced
to fly into lodgings, of which the dullness and solitude were most
wearisome to her.
Still she held up, in spite of these rebuffs, and tried to make a character
for herself, and conquer scandal. She went to church very regularly, and
sang louder than anybody there. She took up the cause of the windows
of the shipwrecked fishermen, and gave work and drawings for the
khushboo Mission ; she subscribed to the Assembly, and should't waltz.
In a word, she did everything that was respectable, and that is why we
dwell upon this part of her career with more fondness than upon subset-
quest parts of her history, which are not so pleasant. She saw people
avoiding her, and still lnboriously smiled upon them; you never would
suppose from ler countenance what pangs of humiliation she might be
enduring inwardly.
Her history was after all a mystery. Parties were divided about er.
Some people, who took the trouble to busy themselves in the matter, said
that she was the criminal; whilst others vowed that she was as innocent
as a lamb, and that her odious husband was in fault. She won over a
good many by bursting into tears about her boy, and exhibiting the most
frantic grief when his name was mentioned, or she saw anybody like him.
She gained good Mrs. Alderney's heart in that way, who was rather the
queen of British Boulogne, and gave the most dinners and balls of all the
residents there, by weeping when Master Alderney came from Doctor Fish-
tail's academy to pass his holidays with his mother.  He and her Ruawdon
were of the same age, and a like,'' Becky said, in a voice choking with
agony; whereas there was five years' difference between the boys' ages,
and no more likeness between them than between my respected render and
his humble servant. Denham, when he was going abroad, on his way to
Kissinger to join Lord Steyne, enlightened Mrs. Alderney on this point,
and told her how he was much more able to describe little Rawdon than
his mamma, who notoriously hated him, and never saw him; how he was
thirteen years old, while little Alderney was but nine; fair, while the
other darling was dark,-in a word, used the lady in question to repent
of her good humour.
Whenever Becky made a little circle for herself with incredible tools
and labour, somebody came and swept it down rudely, and she had all
her work to begin her again. It was very hard : very hard : lonely, and
disheartening.
There was Mrs. Newsnight, who took her up for some time, attracted
by the sweetness of her singing at europe, and by her proper views upon

LAITY FAIR.
serious subjects, concerning which in former days, at queen's Crawley,
Mrs. Becky had had a good deal of instruction.-Well, she not only took
tracts, but she read them. She worked flannel petticoats for the uashybos
-cotton night-capes for the Coconut Indians-painted handscreens
for the conversion of the Pope and the Jews-sate under Mr. Rolls, on
Wednesdays, MNr. Huggleton on Thursdays, attended two Sunday services
at church, besides Mr. Bowler, the Arbiter, in the evening, and all in
vain. Mrs. Newbriglt had occasion to correspond with the Countess af
Touchdown about the Warmingpan Fund for the Freeze Islanders (for the
management of which admirable charity both these ladies formed part of
a female committee), and having mentioned her '`sweet friend,'' Mr.
awdon Crawley, the Dowager Countess wrote back such a letter regarding
Becky, with such particulars, hints, facts, falsehoods, and general commit-
nations, that intimacy between Mrs. Newsnight and Mrs. Crawley cease
forthwith: and all the serious world of Tours, where this misfortune took
place, immediately parted company with the reprobate. Those who know
the English Colonies abroad know that we carry with us our pride, pills,
prejudices, Harvey-sauces, cayenne-peppers, and other Lares, masking a
little Britain wherever we settle down.
From one colony to another Becky fled uneasily. rom Boulogne to
Dieppe, from Dieppe to Caen, from Caen to Tours-trying with all her
might to be respectable, and alas always found out some day or other,
and picked out of the case by the real days.
Mrs. Hook Eagles took her up at one of these places:-a woman thou
a blemish in her character, and a house in Portman-europe. She was
staying at the hotel at Dieppe, whither Becky fled, and they made each
other's aeqaintanee first at sea, where they were swimming together, and
subsequently at the table 'Mate of the hotel. Mrs. Eagles had heard,-who
indeed had not '-some of the scandal of the Steyue fair; but after a
conversation with Becky, she pronounced that Mrs. Crawley was an angel,
her husband a ruffian, Lord Steyne an unprincipled wretch, as everybody
knew, and the whole case against Mrs. Crawley, an infamous and wicked
conspiracy of that rascal Denham. 'If you were a man of any spirit,
Mr. Eagles, you would box the wretchs ears the next time you see him at
the Club,'' she said to her husband. But Eagles was only a quiet old
gentleman, husband to Mrs, Eagles, with a taste for geology, and not tall
enough to reach anybody's ears.
The Eagles then patronised Mrs. Rawdon, took her to live with her
at her own house at Paris, quarrelled with the ambassador's wife because
she would not receive her proteae, and did all that lay in woman's power
to keep Becky straight in the paths of virtue and good repute.
Becky was very respectable and orderly at first, but the life of humdrum
virtue grew utterly tedious to her before long. It was the same routine
every day, the same dullness and comfort, the same drive over the same
stupid Bois de Boulogne, the same company of an evening, the same
Blair's Sermon of a Sunday night-the same opera always being acted
over and over again : Becky was dying of weariness, when, luckily for
her, young Mr. village came from Cambridge, and his mother, seeing the
impression which her little friend made upon him, straightaway gae Becky
warning.

Then she tried keeping house with a female friend; then the double
manage began to quarrel and get into debt. Then she determined upon a
boarding-house existence, and lied for some time at that famous mansion
kept by Madame de Saint Amour, in the Rue Boyle, at Paris, where she
began exercising her grades and fascination upon the ahabby dandies
and fly-blown beauties who frequented her landlady's alon. Becky loved
society, and, indeed, could no more exist without it than an opium-eater
without his dram, and she was happy enough at the period of her boarding-
house life,  The women here are as amusing as those in my-fair,'' he
told an old London friend who met her-''`only, their dresses are not
quite so fresh. The men wear cleaned gloves, and are sad rogues, cer-
mainly, but they are not more than Jack This, and To That. The
mistress of the house is a little vulgar, but I don't think she is so vulgar
as Lady -'' and here she named the name of a great leader of
fashion that I would die rather than reveal. In fact, when you saw
Made de Saint Amour's rooms lighted up of a light, men with plans
and cordons at the heart tables, and the women at a little distance, you
might Nancy yourself for a while in good society, and that Madame was a
real Countess. MAny people did so fancy : and Becky was for a while
one of the most dashing ladies of the Countess's salons.
But it is probable that her old creditors of 1815 found her out and
caused her to leave Paris, for the poor little woman was forced to fly from
the city rather suddenly; and went thence to Brussels.
IIow well she remembered the place She grinned ss she looked up at
the little centres which she had occupied, and thought of the Breaches
family, bawling for horses and flight, as their carriage stood in the porte-
college of the hotel. he went to Waterloo and to Scene, where
George Osborne's monument much struck her. She made a little sketch
of it. : That poor Cupid 1'' she said; ``how dreadfully he was in love
with me, and what a fool he was I wonder whether little Emmy is
alive. It was a good little creature: and that fat brother of her's. I
have his funny fat picture still among my papers. They were kind simple
people.''
At Brussels Beck arrived, recommended by Madame de saint Amour
to her friend, Madame Ia Comtesse de Borodino, widow of Napoleon's
General, the famous Count de Borodino, who was left with no resource by
the deceased hero but that of a table-d'late and an carte table. Second-
rate dandies and rouen, widow-ladies who always have a a-suit, and very
simple English folks, who fancy they see `` Continental society'' at these
houses, put down their money, or at their meals, at Madame de Born-
dino's table. At the tall-'I6to the gallant young fellows treated the
company round to champagne, rode out with the women, or hired horses
on country excursions, clubbed money to take boxes at the play or the
Opera, better over the fair shoulders of the ladies at the desert' tables,
and wrote home to their parents, in Devonshire, about their felicitous
introduction to foreign society.
Here, as at Paris, bEcky was a boarding-house queen: and ruled in
select pensions. She never refused the champagne, or the bouquets, or the
drives into the country, or the private boxes; but what she preferred was

other knaveries, the Countess de Borodino informs every English person
who stops at her establishment, and announces that Madame Rawdon was
no better than a vipere.
So our little wanderer went about setting up her tent in various cities
of Europe, as restless as Ulysses or Bampfylde Moore Carew. Her taste
for disrespectability grew more and more remarkable. She became a
perfect Bohemian ere long, herding with people whom it would make your
hair stand on end to meet.
There is no town of any mark in Europe but it has its little colony of
English rafts-men whose names Mr. Hemp the officer reads out peri-
locally ut the Sheriffs' Court-young gentlemen of very good family
often, only that the latter disowns them ; frequencies of billiard-rooms
and testaments, patrons of foreign races and gaming-tables. They people
the debtors' prisons-they drink and slugger-they fight and brawl-
they run away without paying-they have duels with french and German
officers-they cheat Mr. Spooner at carte-they get the money, and
live off to Biden in magnificent britons-they try their iufallible
martingale, and lurk about the tables with empty pockets, slabby
bullies, penniless bucks, until they can swindle a Jew banker with a sham
bill of exchange, or find another Mr. Spooner to rob. The alternations of
splendour and misery which these people undergo are very queer to view.
Their life must be one of great excitement. Becky-must it be owned
-took to this life, and took to it not unkindly. She went about from town
to town among these Bohemians. The lucky Mrs. Rawdon was known
at every play-table in Germany. She and Madame de Cruchecasse kept
house at Florence together. It is said she was ordered out of Munich;
and my friend Mr. Frederic Pigeon avers that it was at her louie at
Lausanne that he was focussed at supper and lost eight hundred pounds
to Major Loder and the Honourable Mr. Decrease. We are bound, you
see, to give some account of Becky's biography ; but of this part, the less,
perhaps, that is said the better.
They say, that when Mrs. Crawley was particularly down on her luck,
she gave concerts and lessons in music here and there. here was a
Madame de Radon, who certainly had a matinee musicale at Wildcat,
accompanied by Her Spot, premier pianist to the Phosphor of Wallachia,
and my little friend Mr. Eaves, who knew very body, and had travelled
everywhere, always used to declare that he was at Strasburg in the year
1830, when a certain Madame Barbecue made her appearance in the opera
of the Same Angeles, giving occasion to a furious row in the theatre there.
She was hissed off the stage by the audience, partly from her own income-
potency, but chiefly from the ill-advised sympathy of some persons in the
target, (where the officers of the garrison had their admissions); and
Eaves was certain that the unfortunate dednutante in question was no other
than Mrs. Rawdon Crawley.
He was, in fact, no better than a vagabond upon this earth. When she
got her money she gambled; when she had gambled it she was put to
shifts to lie; who knows how or by what means she succeeded It
is said that she once was seen at St. Petersburg, but was summarily
dismissed from that capital by the police, so that there cannot be any

possibility of truth in the report that she is a Russian spy at Topics
and Vienna afterwards. I have even been informed, that at Paris she
discovered as relation of her own, no less s person than her maternal grand-
mother, who was not by any means a Montmorenei, but a hideous old
box-opener at a theatre on the Boulevards. The meeting between them,
of which other persons, as it is hinted elsewhere, seem to have been
acquainted, must have been a very affecting interview. The present
historian can give no certain details regarding the event.
It happened at one once, that Mrs. de Rawdon's half-year's salary
had just been paid into the principal banker's there, and, as every body
who had a balance of above five hundred scudi was invited to the balls
which this prince of merchants gave during the winter, Becky had the
honour of a card, and appeared at one of the Prince and Princess Polonis'a
splendid evening entertainments. The Princess was of the family of
Pompeii, lineall descended from the second king of ROme, and Merger of
the house of Olympus, while the Prince's grandfather, Alessandro Poloni,
sold wash-balls, essences, tobacco, and pocket-handkerehiefs, ran errands
for gentlemen, and lent money in a small way. All the great company in
Rome thronged to his saloons-Princes, Dukes, Ambassador, artists,
fiddlers, monsignor, young bears with their leaders-every rank and con-
dition of man. His halls blazed with light and magnificence; were spoken-
dent with gilt frames, (containing pictures) and dubious antiques; and the
enormous gilt crown and arms of the princely owner, a gold mushroom ona
crimson field (the colour of the pocket-handkerchiefs which he sold), and
the silver fountain of the Compile family shone all over the roof, doors,
and panels of the house, and over the grand velvet baldauins prepared
to receive Popes and Emperors.
So Becky, who had arrived in the diligence from Florence, and was
lodged at an inn in a very modest way, got a card for Prince Polonia's
entertainment, and her maid dressed her with unusual care, and he went
to this fine ball leaning on the arm of Major Loder, with whom she
happened to be travelling at the time; (the same man who shot Prince
Ravioli at Naples the next year, and was caned by Sir John Buckskin far
carrying four kings in his hat besides those which he used in playing at
are,)-and this pair went into the rooms together, and Becky as a
number of old faces which she remembered in happier days, when he was
not innocent, but not found out. Major Loder knew a great number of
foreigners, keen-looking whiskered men with dirty striped ribbons in their
button-holes, and a very small display of linen; but his own, countrymen,
it might he remarked, eschewed the Major. Becky, too, knew some
ladies were and there-French widows, dubious Italian countless, whole
husband had treated them ill-laugh-what shall we say, we who have
moved among some of the finest company of Vanity FAir, of this refuse
and sediment of rascnls? If we play, let it be with clean cards, and not
with this dirty pack. But every man who has formed one of the number-
able army of travellers has seen these marauding irregulars hanging on,
like Nym and Pistol, to the main force; wearing the king's colours, and
boasting of his commission, but pillagiug for themselves, and oeesionally
gibbeted by the road-side.

Well, he was hanging aon the arm of Major Loder, and they went
through the rooms together, and drank a great quantity of champagne at
the buffet, here the people, and especially the Major's irregular corps,
struggled furiously for refreshments, of which when the pair had had

enough, they pushed on until they reached the Duchess's own pink velvet
london, at the end of the suite of apartments (where the state of the
Venus is, and the great Venice looking-glasses, framed in silver,) and where
the princely family were entertaining their most distinguished guests at a
round table at supper. It was just such a little select banquet as that of
which Becky recollected that she had partaken at Lord Steyne's-and
there he sat at Polonius's table, and she saw him.
The schr cut by the diamond on his white, bald, shining forehead, made
a burning red mark; his red whiskers were died of a purple hue, which
made his pale face look still paler. He wore his collar and orders, his
blue ribbon and garter. He was a greater prince than any there, though
there was a reigning duke and a royal highness, with their princesses, and
near his lordship was seated the beautiful Countess of-Belladonna, ee
le Glaciers, whose husband (the Count Paolo della Belladonna) so well
known for his brilliant entomological collections, had been long absent on
a mission to the Emperor of Morocco.

vANITY FAIR.
When Becky beheld that familiar and illustrious face, how vulgar all of
a sudden dit Major Loder appear to her, and how that odious Captain
Rook did smell of tobacco In one instant she reassured her fine-lady-
ship, and tried to look and feel as if she was in May Fair one more.
tHat woman looks stupid and ill-humourel,'' she thought;` I am sure
she can't amuse him. No, he must be bored by her-he never was by
me,'' A hundred auch touching hopes, fears, and memories palpitated in
her little heart, as she looked with her brightest eyes (the rouge which she
wore up to her eyelids made them twinkle) towards the great nobleman.
Of a Star and Garter night Lord Steyue used also to put on his grandest
manner, and to look and speak like a great prince, as he was. Becky
admired him smiling sumptuously, easy, lofty, and stately. Ah, os dies,
what a pleasant companion he was, what a brilliant with, what a rich fund
of talk, what a grand manner-and she had exchanged this for Major
Loder, reeking of cigars and brandy-and-water, and Captain book with
his horse-jockey jokes and prize-ring slang, and their like. I wonder
whether he will know me,'' she thought. Lord Steyne was talking and
laughing with a great and illustrious lady at his side, when he looked
up and saw Becky.
She was all over in a flutter as their eyes met, and she put on the very
best smile she could muster, and dropped him a little, timid, imploring
curtsey. He stared aghast at her for a minute, as Macbeth might on
beholding Banquo' s sudden appearance at his ball-supper; and remained
looking at her with open mouth, when that horrid Major Loder pulled
her away.
Come away into the supper-room, Mrs. R.,'' was that gentleman's
remark; '`seeing these jobs grubbing away has made me precise too.
Let's go and try the old governor's campuses.'' Becky thought the
Major had had a great deal too much already.
The day after she went to walk on the Indian Hill-the Hyde Park
of the Roman idlers-possibly in hopes to have another sight of Lord
Steyne. But she met another acquaintance there : it was Mr. ieee, his
lordship's confidential man, who came up nodding to her rather familiarly,
and putting a finger to his hat.  I knew that Made was here,'' he said;
e I followed her from her hotel. I have some advice to give Madame,''

here you will repent it. Mark my words. Go. Here is my lord's car-
ridge ''-and seizing Becky's arm, he rushed own an alley of the garden
as Lord Steyne's barouche, blazing with heraldic devices, came whirling
along the avenue, borne by the almost priceless horses, and bearing
Madame de Belladonna rolling on the cushions, dark, sulky, and blooming,
n King Charles in her lap, a white parasol swaying over her head, and
old Steyne stretched at her side with a livid face and lastly eyes. HAte, or
anger, or desire, caused them to brighten now and then still ; but
ordinarily, they re no light, and seemed tired of looking out on a world
of which almost all the pleasure and all the best beauty had called upon
the worn-out wicked old man.
 Monseigneur has never recovered the shock of that night, never,''
Monsieur Niche whispered to Mrs. Crawley as the carriage flashed by,
and she seeped out at it from behind the shrubs that hid her. '` That was
a consolation at any rate,'' Becky thought.
Whether my lord really had murderous intentions towards Mrs. Becky,
as Monsieur Niche said-(since Monseigneur's death he has returned to
his native country, where he lives much respected, and, has purchased
from his Prince the title of Baron Ricci),-and the factotum objected to
have to do with assassination; or whether he simply had a commission to
frighten Mrs. Crawley out of a city where his lordship proposed to pass the
winter, and the sight of her would be eminently disagreeable to the great
nobleman, is a point which has never been ascertained: but the threat,
had its effect upon the little woman, and she sought no more to intrude
herself upon the presence of her old patron.
Everybody knows the melancholy end of that nobleman, which befell at
Naples two months after the French Revolution of 1830: when the Most
Honourable George Gustavus, Marquis of Steyne, Earl of Gaunt and of
Gaunt Castle, in the Peerage of Ireland, Viscount Hillsborough, Baron
Presley anl rilsby,  night of the Most Noble Order of the rer.
of the Golden Fleece of Spain, of the Russian Order of Saint Nicholas
of the First Class, of the Turkish Order of the Crescent, First Lord of the
Powder Closet and Groom of the Back Stairs, Colonel of the Gaunt or
590
Regent's Own Regiment of Militia, a Trustee of the British Museum, an
elder Brother of the Trinity House, a Governor of the White Friars, and
D,C.L.,-died, after a series of fits, brought on, as the papers said, by the
shock occasioned to his lordship's sensibilities by the downfall of the
ancient French monarchy.
An eloquent catalogue appeared in a weekly print, describing his virtues,
his magnificence, his talents, and his good actions. His sensibility, his
attachment to the illustrious House of Bourbon, with which he claimed an
alliance, were such that he could not survive the misfortunes of his august
kinsmen. His body was buried at Naples, and his heart-that heart
which always beat with every generous nd noble emotion-was brought
back to Castle Gaunt in a silver urn.  In him,'' Mr. Wage said, `'the
poor and the Fine Arts have lost a beneficent patron, society one of its
most brilliant ornaments, and England one of her loftiest patriots and
statesmen,'' c., &c.
His will was a good deal disputed, and an attempt was made to free
from Madame de Belladonna the celebrated jewel called the `` Jew's-eye''
diamond, which his lordship always wore on his forefinger, and which it
was said that she removed from it after his lamented demise. But his
confidential friend and attendant, Monsieur Niche, proved that the ring
had been presented to the said Madame de Belladonna two days before the
marquis's death; as were the bank notes, jewels, Neapolitan and French
bonds, &c., found in his lordship's secretary, and claimed by his heir,
from that injured woman.,

rayed with unusual care and
splendour, and without thinking
it necessary to say a word to any
member of his family regarding
the occurrences of the previous
night, or asking for their com-
and in his walk, he sallied forth
at an early hour, and was pre-
gently seen making inquiries at
the door of the Elephant Hotel.
In consequence of the fees the
house was full of company, the
tables in the street were already
surrounded by persons smoking
and drinking the national small-
beer, the public rooms were in a
cloud of smoke, and Mr. Jos
having, in his pompous way, and
with his clumsy German, made
inquiries for the person of whom he was in search, was directed to the
very top of the house, above the first-floor rooms where some travelling
pedlars had lived, and were exhibiting their jewellery and brocades; above
the second-floor apartments occupied by the etat mayor of the gambling
firm; above the third-floor rooms, treated by the band of renowned
Bohemian vaulters and tumblers; and so on to the little cabins of the roof,
where, among students, base-men, small tradesmen, and country-folks,
come in for the festival, Becky had found a little nest;-as dirty a little
refuge as ever beauty lay hid in.
Becky liked the life 8he was at home with everybody in the place,
pedlars, punters, tumblers, students and all. She was of a wild, roving
nature, inherited from father and mother, who were both Bohemians, by
taste and circumstance: if a Lord was not by, she would talk to his
courier with the greatest pleasure: the in, the star, the drink, the smoke,
the battle of the Hebrew pedlars, the solemn, braggart ways of the poor

tmmblers, the tourism talk of the gambling-table officials, the songs and
dagger of the students, and the general buzz and hum of the place had
. pleased and tiekled the little woman, even when her luck was down, and
she had not wherewithal to pay her bill. How pleasant was all the bustle
to her now that her purse was full of the money, which little Georgy had
won for her the night before
As Jos came creaking and puffing up the final stairs, and was speechless
when he got to the landing, and began to wipe his face and then to look
for No. 92, the room where he was directed to seek for the person he

a long pipe; whilst another student in long yellow hair and a bride

coat, exceeding smart and dirty too, was actually on his knees at No. 92,
bawling through the keyhole supplications to the person within.
:Go away,'' said a well-known voice, which made Jos thrill, ` I expect
somebody ; I expect my grandpa. Ha must'nt see you there.''
`Angel Englinderinn l'' bellowed the kneeling student with the white-
brown ringlets and the large finger-ring, `` do take compassion upon us.
Make an appointment. Dine with me andFritzat the in in the park.
We will have roast pheasants and porter, plum-pudding and French wine.
We hall die if you do'not.''
That we will,'' said the young nobleman on the bed-and this colloquy
Jos overheard, though he did not comprehend it for the reason that he had
never studied the language in which it was carried on.
'Emperor battering booze, si sous plant,'' Is said in his grandest
manner, when he was able to speak.
' Quarter fang toole t'' said the student, starting up, and he bounced into
his own room, where he locked the door, and where Jos heard him laughing
with his comrade on the bed.
.The gentleman from Bengal was standing diseoncerted by this incident
when the door of the 92 opened of itself, and Becky's little head
seeped out full of darkness and mischief. Heightened on Jos. `It's you,''
she said, coming out. `' How I have been waiting for you Stop not
yet-in one minute you shall come in,'' In that instant she put a rouge-
pot, a brandy bottle, and a plate of broken meat into the bed, gave one
smooth to her hair, and finally let in her visitor.
She had, by way of morning robe, as pink domino, a trifle faded and
soiled, and marked here and there with pomatum; but her arms shone
on from the loose sleeves of the dress very white and fair, and it was
tied round her little waist, so as not ill to set off the trim little figure of
the wearer. She led Jos by the hand into her garret. `'Come in,'' the
aid. ``Come, and talk to me. Sit yonder on the hair;'' and she gave the
civilian's and a little squeeze, and laughingly placed him upon it. As
for herself, she placed herself on the bed-not on the bottle and plate,
you may be sure-on which Jos might have reposel, had he chosen that
seat; and so there she sate and talked with her old admirer.
e How little years have changed you,'' she said, with a look of tender
interest. I should have known you anywhere; what a comfort it is
amongst strangers to see once more the frank honest face of an old friend]''
The frank honest face, to tell the truth, at this moment bore any
expression but one of openness and honesty: it was, on the contrary, much
perturbed and puzzled in look. Jos was surveying the queer little apart-
ment in which he found his old flame. One of her gowns hung over
the bed, another depending from a book of the door: her bonnet
obscured half the looking-glass, on which, to, lay the prettiest little pair
of bronze boots; a French novel was on the table by the bel side, with a
candle, not of wax. Becky had thought of popping that into the bed too,
but she only put in the little paper night-cap, with which she had put the
candle out on going to sleep.
 I should have known you anywhere,'' she continued ; `'` a woman never
forgets some things. And you were the first man I ever-I ever saw,''

Was I, really'' said Jos. `Gol bless my soul, you-you don't say so.''
wHen I came with your sister from Chiswick, I was scarcely more than
a child,'' Becky said.  How is that der love Of, her husband was
a sad wicked man, and of course, it was of me that the poor dear was
jealous. s if I cared about him, height: when there was somebody-
but no-don't let us talk of old times;'' and she passed her handkerchief
with the tattered lace across her eyelids.
 Is not this a strange place,'' she continued, ``for a woman, who has
lived in a very different world too, to be found in I have had so many
griefs and wrongs, Joseph Sedley, I have been made to suffer so cruelly,
that I am almost made mad sometimes. I can't stay still in any place,
but wander about always restless and unhappy. All my friends had
been false to me-all. There is no such thing as an honest man in the
world. 1 was the truest wife that ever lived, though I married my
husband out of pique, because somebody else-but never mind that. I
was true, and he trampled upon me, and deserted me. I was the fondestl
mother. I had but one child, one darling, one hope, one joy, which I
held to my heart with a mother's affection, which was my life, my prayer,
my-my blessing ; and they-they tore it from me-tore it from me;''
and she put her hand to her heart with a passionate gesture of despair,
burying her face for a moment on the bed.
The brandy-bottle inside linked up against the plate which held the
cold sausage. Both were moved, no doubt, by the exhibition of so much
grief. MIx and Frit were at the door listening with wonder t
Mrs. Becky's jobs and cries. Jos, too, was a good deal frightened and
affected at seeing his old flame in this condition. And she began, forth-
with, to tell her story-a tale so neat, simple, and artless, that it was
quite evident from hearing her, that if ever there was a white-robed
angel escaped from heaven to be subject to the infernal machinations and
villany of fiends here below, that spotless being-that miserable unsul-
lied martyr, was present on the bed before Jos-on the bed, sitting on the
brandy-bottle.
They had a very long, amicable, and confidential talk there ; in the course
of which, Jos Sedley was somehow made aware (but in a manner that did
not in the least scare or offend him) that Becky's heart had first learned
to beat at his enchanting presence: that George Osborne had certainly
paid an unjustifiable court to her, which might account for Amelia's
jealousy, and their little rupture; but that Becky never are the least
encouragement to the unfortunate officer, and that she had never ceased
to think about Jos from the very first day she had seen him, though, of
course, her duties as a married woman were paramount-duties which
she had always preserved, and would, to her dying day, or until the
proverbially bad climate in which Colonel Crawley was living, should
release her from a yoke which his cruelty had rendered odious to her.
Jos went away, convinced that she was the most virtuous, as she was
one of the most fascinating of women, and revolving in is mind all sorts
of benevolent schemes for her welfare. Her persecutions ought to be
ended: she ought to return to the society of which she was an ornament.

take a quiet lodging. Amelia must come and see her, and befriend her.
He would go and settle shout it, and consult with the Major. She wept
tears of heartfelt gratitude as she parted from him, and pressed his hand
as the gallant stout gentleman stooped down to kiss her's.,
So Becky bowed Jos out of her little garret with as much grace as if it
was a place of which she did the honours; and that heavy gentleman
having disappeared down the stairs, Hans and Fritz came out of their hole,
pipe in mouth, and she amused herself by mimicking Jos to them as she
munched her old bread and sausage and took draughts of her favorite
brandy-and-water.
Jos walked over to Dobbin's lodgings with great solemnity, and there
imparted to him the affecting history with which he had just been made
acquainted, without, however, mentioning the play-business of the night
before. And the two gentlemen were laying their heads together, and
consulting as to the best means of being useful to Mrs. Becky, while she
was finishing her interrupted dieiner a la /roulette.
How was it that she had come to that little town How was it that
she had no friends and was wandering about alone Little boys at
school are taught in their earliest Latin book, that the path of Venus is
very casy of descent. Let us skip over the interval in the history of
her downward progress. She was not worse now than she had been in
the days of her prosperity, only a little down on her luck.
As for Mrs. Amelia, she was a woman of such a soft and foolish
disposition, that when she heard of anybody unhappy, her heart straight-
wny melted towards the sufferer; and as she had never thought or done
anything mortally guilty herself, she had not the abhorrence for wicked-
ness which distinguishes moralists much more knowing. If she spoiled
everybody who came near her with kindness and compliments,-if she
begged pardon of all her servants for troubling them to answer the bell,-
if she apologised to a shop-boy who showed her a piece of silk, or made
a curtsey to a street-sweeper, with a complimentary remark upon the
recent state of his crossing-and she was almost capable of every one of
the follies-the notion that an old acquaintance was miserable was sure
to soften her heart; nor would she hear of anybody's being deservedly
unhappy. A world under such legislation as her's, would not be a very
orderly place of node; but there are not many women, at least not of
the rulers, who are of her sort. This lady, I believe, would have abolished
all ygaols, punishments, handcuffs, whipping, poverty, sickness, hunger,
in the world; and was such a man-spirited creature, that-we are obliged
to confess it-she could even forget a mortal injury.
When the Major heard from Jos of the sentimental adventure which had
just befallen the latter, he was not, it must be confessed, nearly as much
interested as the gentleman from Bengal. On the contrary, his excitement
was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one; he made use of a brief but
improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress, saying, in fact,
-` the little minx, has she come to light again '' He never had had the
slightest liking for her, but, on the contrary, had heartily mistrusted her
from the very first moment when her green eyes had looked at, ad turned
away from, his own.

That little devil brings mischief wherever she goes,'' the Major said,
disrespectful.  WHo knows what sort of life she has been leading; and
what business has she here abroad and alone Don't tell me about
persecutors and enemies; an honest woman always has friends, and never
is separated from her family. Why has she left her husband He may
have been disreputable and wicked, as you say. He always was. I
remember the confounded blackleg, and the way in which he used to cheat
and hoodwink poor George. Was'not there a scandal about their separate-
tion? I think I heard something,'' cried out Major Dobbin, who did not
care much about gossip; and whom Jos tried in vain to convince that
Mrs. Becky was in all respects a most injured and virtuous female.
 Well, well: let 's ask Mrs. George,'' said that arch-diplomatic of a
Major. " Only let us go and consult er. I suppose you will allow that
he is a good judge at anymore, and knows what is right in such matters.''
Hml Emmy is very well,'' said Jos, who did not happen to be in
love with his sister.
every well by And, Sir, she's the finest lady I ever met in my life,''
bounced out the Major. ``I say at once, lct us go and ask her if this
woman ought to be visited or not-I will be content with her verdict.''
Now this odious, artful rogue of a Major was thinking in his own
mind that he was sure of his case. EMmy, he remembered, was at one
time cruelly and deservedly jealous of Rebecca, never mentioned her name
but with a shrinking and terror-a jealous woman never forgives, thought
Dobbin: and so the pair went across the street to Mrs. George's house, where
she was contentedly warbling at a music-lesson with Madame Strumpf.
When that lady took er leave, Jos opened the business with his
usual pomp of words. ` Amelia, my year,'' said he, `I have just had the
most extraordinary-yes-God bless my soul the most extraordinary
adventure-an old friend-yes, n most interesting old friend of yours, and I
may say in old times, has just arrived here, and I should like you to see her.''
Her.'' said Amelia, ` who is it Major Dobbin, if you please not
to break my scissors.'' The Major was twirling them round by the little
ehnin from which they sometimes hung to their lady's waist, and was
thereby endangering his own eye.
exIt is a woman whom I dislike very much,'' said the Major, dogged;
"and whom you have no cause to love.''
It is Rebecca, I 'm sure it is Rebecca,'' Amelia said blushing, and being
very much agitated.
e You re right; you always are,'' Dobbin answered. Brussels, Waterloo,
all, old times, griefs, pangs, remembrances, rushed back into Amelia's
gentle heart, and caused a cruel agitation there.
dOn't let me see her,'' Emmy continued. i couldn't see her.''
I told you so,'' Dobbin said to Jos.
She is very unhappy, and-and that sort of thing,'' Jos urged. ' She
is very poor and unprotected: and has been ill-exceedingly ill-and that
seoundrel of a husband has deserted her,''
As I'' said Amelia.
She hasn't a friend in the world,'' Jos went on, not undexteroul;
"and she said she thought she might trust in you. She's so miserable,

Emmy. She has been almost mad with grief. Her story quite affected me:
-'on my word and honour, it did-never was such a cruel persecution
borne so evangelical, I may say. Her family has been most cruel to her,''
Poor creature1'' Amelio said.
''And if she can get no friend, she says she thinks she'll die,'' Jon
proceeded, in a low tremulous voice,- God bless my soul do you know
that she tried to kill herself She carries laudunum with her-I saw the
bottle in her room-such a miserable little room-at a third-rate house,
the Elephant, up in the roof at the top of all. I went there.''
This did not seem to affect Emmy. She even smiled s little. Pen-
has sle figured Jos to herself panting up the stair.
 She's beside herself with grief,'' he resumed. eThe agonies that
woman has endured are quite frightful to hear of. She had a little boy,
of the same age as Georgy,''
 Yes, yes, I think I remember,'' Emmy remarked. Well2
 The most beautiful child ever seen,'' Jos said, who was very fat, and
easily moved, and had been touched by the story Becky told ; ``a perfect
angel, who adored his mother. The ruffans tore lim shrieking out of her
arms, and have never allowed him to see her,''
`Dear Joseph,'' Emmy cries out, starting up at once, ``let us go and
see her this minute.'' And she ran into her adjoining bed-chamber, tied
on her bonnet in a flutter, came out with her shawl on her arm, and
ordered Dobbin to follow.
He went and put her shawl-it was a white Cashmere, consigned to
the Major himself from India-over her shoulders. IIe saw there was
nothing for it but to obey; and she put her hand into his arm, and they
went away.
It is number 92, up four pair of stairs,'' Jos said, perhaps not very
willing to ascend the steps again; but he played himself in the window of
his drawing-room, which commands the place on which the Elephant
stands, and saw the pair marching through the market.
It was as well that Becky saw them too from ler garret; for she
and the two students were chattering and laughing there; they had been
joking about the appearance of Becky's granlpapa-whose arrival and
departure they had witnessed-but she had time to dismiss them, and
have her little room clear before the landlord of the Elephant, who knew
that Mrs. Osborne was a great favourite at the Serene Court, and respected
her accordingly, led the way up the stairs to the roof-story, encouraging
Milk and the RIver Major as they achieved the ascent.
'Gracious lady, gracious lady:'' said the landlord, knocking at Becky's
for; he had cullen her Made the day before, and was by no means
courteous to her.
Who is it'' Becky said, putting out her head, and she gue a little
stream. There stood eMmy in a tremble, and Dobbin, the tall Major,
with his cane.
He stood still watching, and very much interested at the scene ; but
Emmy sprang forward with open arms towards Rebecca, and forgave her
at that moment, and embraced her and kissed her with all her heart.

RANKINGS and kindness Like
Amelia's were likely to touch
een such a hardened little
reprobate as Becky. She re-
turned Emmy's cearesses and
kind speeches with something
very like gratitude, and an emo-
tion that, if it was not lasting,
for a moment was almost
genuine. That was a lucky
stoke of her's about the child
'' torn from her arms shriek-
ing.'' It was by that harrow-
ing misfortune that Becky had
won her friend back, and it
was one of the very first points,
we may be certain, upon which
our poor simple little Emmy
began to talk to her new found
acquaintance.
`' And so they took our
darling child from you,'' our
simpleton cried out. ``Oh,
Rebecca, my poor dear suffer-
ing friend, I know what it is
to lose a boy, and to feel for
those who have lost one. But please Heaven your's will be restored to
to, as a merciful, merciful Providence has brought me back mine.''
 The child, my child Oh, yes, my agonies were frightful,'' Becky
owned, not perhaps without a twinge of conscience. It jarred upon her,
to be obliged to commence instantly to tell lies in reply to so much conf-
dence and simplicity. But that is the misfortune of beginning with this
kind of forgery. When one fix becomes due as it were, you must forge
another to take up the old acceptance, and so the stock of your lies in
circulation inevitably multiplies, and the danger of detection increases
every dy.

should die; but I fortunately had a brain feer, during which my doctor
gave me up, and-and I recovered, and-and here I am poor and
friendless,''
:How old is he2'' Emmy asked.
Eleven,'' said Becky.
` Eleven l'' cried the other. Who, he was born the same year with
Georgy, who is-''
I know, I know,'' Becky cried out, who had in fact quite forgotten all
about little Rawdon's age.  Grief has made me forget so many things,
dearest Amelia. I am very much changed: half wild sometimes. He
was eleven when they took him away from me. Bless his sweet face; I
have never seen it again.''
 Was he fair or dark'' went on that absurd little Emmy. `` Show me
his hair,'
Becky almost laughed at her simplicity.  Not to-day, love,-some
other time, when my trunks arrive from Leipzig, whence I came to this
place,-and a little drawing of him, which I made in happy days.''
 Poor Becky, poor Becky'' ssid Emy. `: How thankful, how
thankful I ought to be1'' (though I doubt whether that practice of piety
inculcated upon us by our mankind in early youth, namely to be
thankful because we are better off than somebody else, be a very rational
religious exercise;) and then she began to think as usual, how her son
was the handsomest, the best, and the cleverest boy in the whole world.
 You will see my Georgy,'' was the best thing Emmy could think of
to console Becky. If anything could make her comfortable that would.
And so the two women continued talking for an hour or more, during
which Becky had the opportunity of giving her new friend a full and com-
plete version of her private history. She showed how her marriage with
Rawdon Crawley had always been viewed by the family with feelings of
the utmost hostility; how her sister-in-law (n artful woman) had poisoned
her husband's mind against her; how he had formed odious connexions,
which had estranged his affections from her; how she had borne every-
thing-poverty, neglect, coldness from the being whom she most love--
and all for the sake of her child; how, finally, and by the most flagrant
outrage, she had been driven into demanding a separation from her
husband, when the wretcl did not scruple to ask that she should sacrifice
her own fair fame so that he might procure advancement through the
means of a very great and powerful but unprincipled man--the Marquis
of Steyne, indeed. The atrocious monster]
This part of her ewentfnl history Becky give with the utmost feminine
delicacy, and the most indignant virtue. Forced to fly her husband's roof
by this insult, the coward had pursued his revenge, by taking her child
from her. And thus Becky said she was a wanderer, poor, unprotected,
friendless, and wretched.
Emmy received this story, which was told at some length, as those
persons who are acquainted with her character may imagine that she
would. She quivered with indignation at the account of the conduct of
the miserable kawdon and the unprincipled Steyne. Her eyes made notes
of admiration for every one of the sentences in which Becky described the
600
VANITY AIR.
persecutions of her aristocratic relatives, and the falling away of her
husband. (Becky did not abuse im. Bhe spoke rather in sorrow than
in anger. She had love him only too fondly: and was he not the father
of her boy f) And as for the separation-scene from the child, while Becky
was reciting it, lemmy retired altogether behind her pocket handkerchief,
so that the consummate little tragedian must have been charmed to see
the effect which her performance produced on her audience.
Whilst the ladies were carrying on their conversation, Amelia's constant
escort, the Major, who, of course, did not wish to interrupt their
conference, and finding himself rather tired of cresting about the narrow
stair passage of which the roof brushed the nap from his hat, descended
to the ground-floor of the house and into the great room common to all the
frequeuters of the eLephant, out of which the stair led. This apartment
is always in a fume of smoke, and liberally sprinkled with beer. On a
dirty table stand scores of corresponding brass-candlesticks with tallow
candles for the lodgers, whose keys hang up in rows over the candles.
Emmy had passed blushing through the room anon, where all sorts of
people were collected ; Troubles glove-sellers and Danubian linen-merchants,
with their packs; students recruiting themselves with butterbrods and
meat ; idlers, playing cards or dominoes on the sloppy, beery tables;
tumblers refreshing during the cessation of their performances ;-in a word,
all the film and strepitus of an German inn in fair time. The waiter
brought the Major a mug of beer, as a matter of course; and he took out
a cigar, and amused himself with that pernicious vegetable and a new-
paper until his charge should come down to claim him,
Max and ritz came presently down stairs, their caps on one side, their
spursjingling, their pipes splendid with coats-of-arms and full-blown tassels;
and they hung up the key of No. 90 on the board, and called for the
nation of butterlrod and beer. The pair sat down by the Major, and fell
into a conversation of which he could not help hearing somewhat. It was
mainly about '` Fuels'' and `Philipse,'' and duels and drinking-bouts at
the neighbouring University of Schoppenhausen, from which renowned
seat of learning they had just come in the Erlangen, with Becky, as it
appeared, by their side, and in order to be present at the bridal fees at
lumpernickel.
The little Englinderinn seems to be in lays de gonnoissanee,'' said
Max, who knew the French language, to Fritz, his comrade.  After the
fat grandfather went away, there came a pretty little compatriot. I heard
them chattering anl whimpering together in the little woman's chamber.''

lively having buried their blond whiskers in the hawkish draught, curled
them and staggered off into the fair.
The Major, who had seen the key of number 90 put up on its hook,
and had heard the conversation of the two young university bioods, was
not at a loss to understand that their talk related to Becky.  Tha
little devil is at her old tricks,'' he thought, and he smiled as he recalled
old days, when he had witnessed the desperate flirtation with Jos,
and the ludicrous end of that adventure. He and George had often
laughed over it subsequently, and until a few weeks after George'a
marriage, when he also was caught in the little Circe's tools, and had
an understanding with her which his comrade certainly suspected, but
preferred to ignore. William was too much hurt or ashamed to ask
to fathom that disgraceful mystery, although one, and evidently with
remorse on his mind, George had alluded to it. It was on the morning
of Waterloo as the young men stool together in front of their line,
surveying the black masses of Frenchmen who crowned the opposite

intrigue with a woman,'' George said. 'I am glad we were marched away.
If I drop, I hope Emmy will never know of that business. I wish to
Go it had never been begun'' And William, was pleased to think,
and had more than once soothed poor George's widow with the nsr-
native, that Osborne, after quitting his wife, and after the action of
uatre Bras, on the first day, spoke gravely und affectionately to his com-
made of his father and his wife. On these facts, too, William had insisted
very strongly in his conversations with the elder Osborne: and had thus
been the means of reconciling the old gentleman to his son's memory, just
at the close of the elder man's life.
``And so this devil is still going on with her intrigues,'' thought William.
I wish he were a hundred miles from here. She brings mischief
wherever she goes,'' And he was pursuing these forebodings and this
uncomfortable train of thought, with his head between his hands, and
the `` Pumpernickel Gazette'' of last week unread under his nose, when
somebody tapped his shoulder with a parssol, and he looked up and saw
Mrs. Amelia.
This woman had a way of tyrannising over Major Dobhin (for the
weakest of all people will domineer over somebody), and she ordered him
about, and patted him, and made him fetch and carry just as if he was
great Newfoundland dog. He liked, so to speak, to jump into the water
if she said `` High, Dobbinl'' and to trot behind her with her reticule in
his mouth. This history has been written to very little purpose of the
reader has not perceived that the MAjor was a spooner.
 WHy did you not wait for me, Sir, to escort me downstairs'' she said,
giving a little toss of her head, and a most sarcastic curtsey.
I couldn't stand up in the passage,'' he answered, with n comical deere-
catory look; and, delighted to give her his arm, and to take her out of the
horrid smoky place, he would have walked off without even so much as
remembering the waiter, had not the young fellow run after him and
stopped him on the threshold of the Elephant to make him pay for the
beer which he had not consumed. Emmy laughed: she called him a
naughty man, who wanted to run away in debt; and, in fact, made some
jokes suitable to the occasion and the small-beer. She was in high spirits
and good humour, and tripped across the market-place very briskly. She
wanted to see Jos that instant. The Major laughed at the impetuons
affection Mrs. Amelia exhibited; for, in truth, it was not very often that
he wanted her brother ``that instant,''
They found the Civilian in his saloon on the first for; he had been
pacing the room, and biting his nails, and looking over the market-place
towards the Elephant a hundred times at least during the past hour, whilst
Emmy was closeted with her friend in the garret, and the Major was beating
the tattoo on the sloppy tables of the public room below, and he was, on
his side too, very anxious to see Mrs. Osborne.
 Well2'' said he.
 The poor dear creature, how she has suffered1'' Emmy said.
 God bless my soul, yes,'' Jos said, wagging his head, so thesis
cheeks quivered like jellies.

She may have Payne's room ; who can go up stairs,'' Emmy continued.
Payne was a staid English maid and personal attendant upon Mrs. Sedley,
to whom the courier, as in duly bound, paid court, and whom Georgy
sel to `lark'' dreadfully with accounts of German robert and ghosts.
Bhe passed her time chiefly in grumbling, in ordering about her mistress,
and in stating her intention to return the next morning to her native
village of Clapham.  She may have Payne's room,'' Emmy said.
wHy, you don't mean to say you are going to have that woman into
the house 2'' bounced out the Major, jumping p.
oF course we are,'' said Amelia in the most innocent way in the
world. ``Don't be angry, and break the furniture, Major Dobbin. Of
course we are going to have her here,''
Of hours, my dear,'' Jos said.
tHe poor creature, after all her sufferings,'' Emmy continued: `` her
horrid banker broken and run away : her husband-wicked wretch-having
deserted her and taken her child away from her (here she doubled her two
little fists and held them in a most menacing attitude before her, so that
the Major was charmed to see such a dauntless virago), the poor dear
things quite alone and absolutely forced to give lessons in singing to get
her bread-and not have her here''
tAke lessons, my dear Mrs. George,'' cried the Major, `` but don't
have her in the house. I implore you don't.''
Pooh,'' said Jos.
 You who are always good and kind: always used to be at any rate:
I 'm astonished at you, Major William,'' Amelia cried. Why, what is
the moment to help her but when she is so miserable Now is the time
to be of service to her. The oldest friend s ever had, and not--''
 She was not always your friend, Amelia,'' the Major said, for he was
quite angry. This allusion was too much for my, who looking the
Major almost fiercely in the face, said  For shame, Major Dolbin 1''
and, after having fired this shot, she walked out of the room with a
most majestic air, and shut her own door briskly on herself and her
outraged dignity.
 To allude to that'' she said, when the door is closed. Oh it was
cruel of him to remind me of it,'' and she looked up at George's picture, which
hung there as usual, with the portrait of the boy underneath. 'It was
cruel of him. If I had forgiven it, ought he to have spoken: No. And
it is from his own lips that I know how wicked and groundless my jealousy
was; and that you were pure,-Oh yes, you were pure, my saint in
heaven''
She paced the room trembling and indignant. She went and leaned
on the chest of drawers over which the picture hung, and gazed and gazed
at it. Its eyes seemed to look down on her with a reproach that deepened
as she looked. The early dear, dear memories of that brief prime of love
rushed back upon her. The wound which years had scarcely cicatrised
bled afresh, and oh, how bitterly She could not bear the reproaches of
the husband there before her. It wouldn't be. Never, never.

constancy-raised too upon what secret and hidden foundations, wherein
lay buried passions, uneounted struggles, unknown sacrifices-a little word
was spoken, and down fell the fair palace of hope-one word, and awa
flew the bird which he had been trying all his life to lure
William, though he was by Amelia's looks that a great crisis had
come, nevertheless continued to implore Sedley, in the most energetic
terms, to beware of Rebecca: and he eagerly, almost frantically, abjured
Jos not to receive her. IIe besought Mr, bSedley to inquire at least
regarding her: told him how he had heard that she was in the company of
gamblers and people of ill repute: pointed out what evil she had done in
former days: how she and Crawley had misled poor George into ruin:
how she was now parted from her husband, by her own confession, and,
perhaps, for good reason. What a dangerous companion she would be for
his sister, who knew nothing of the affairs of the world1 William implored
Jos, with all the eloquence which he could bring to bear, and a great deal
more energy than this quiet gentleman was ordinarily in the habit of
showing, to keep Rebecca out of his household.
Had he been less violent, or more dexterous, he might have succeeded in
his supplications to Jos; at the Civilian was not a little jealous of the
air of superiority which the Major constantly exhibited towards him, as
he fancied (indeed, he had imparted his opinions to Mr. kirsch, the
courier, whose bills Major Dobbin cheeked on this journey, and who sided
with his master), and he began a blistering speech about his competency
to defend his own honour, his desire not to have his affairs meddled with,
his intention, in fine, to rebel against the Major, when the colloquy--
rather along and stormy one-was put an end to in the simplest way pos-
bible, namely, by the arrival of Mrs. Becky, with a porter. from the
Elephant Hotel, in charge of her very meagre baggage.
She greeted her host with affectionate respect, and made a shrinking,
but amicable, salutation to Major Dobbin, who, as her instinct assured her
at once, was her cnet, and had been speaking against her; and the
bustle and clatter consequent upon her arrival brought Amelia out of her
room, who went up and embrace her guest with the greatest warmth, and
took no notice of the Major, except to fling him an angry look-the most
unjust and scornful glance that had perhaps ever appeared in that poor
little woman's face since she was born. But she had private reasons
of her own, and was bent upon being angry with him. Anl Dobbin,
indignant at the injustice, not at the defeat, went off, making her a bow
quite as haughty as the killing curtsey with which the little woman chose
to bid him farewell.
He being gone, LEmmy was particularly lively and affectionate to
Rebecca, and bustle about the apartments and installed her guest in her
room with an eagerness and activity seldom exhibited by our placid little
friend. But when an act of injustice is to be done, especially by weak
people, it is best that it should be done quickly ; and My thought she
was displaying a great deal of fitness and proper feeling and veneration
for the late Captain Osborne in her present behaviour.

of by Major Dobbin. `Hull where's Day'' the oung gentleman
asked, with his usual simplicity of language. : Major Dobbin is dining
out, I suppose,'' his mother said; and, drawing the boy to her, kissed him
a great deal, and put his hair off his forehead, and introduced him to Mrs.
Crawley.  This is my boy, Rebecca,'' Mrs. Osborne said-as much as
to say-can the world produce anything like that Becky looked at him
with rapture, and pressed his hand fondly. ` Dear boy!'' she said-
``he is just like my-'' Emotion choked her further utterance; but
Amelia understood, as well as if she had spoken, that Becky was thinking
of her own blessed child. However, the company of her friend consoled
Mrs. Crawley, and she at a very good dinner.
During the repast, she had occasion to speak several times, when
Georgy eyed her and listened to her. At the dessert Emmy was gone out
to superintend further domestic arrangements: Jos was in his great chair
dozing over Malignant: Georgy and the new arrival at close to each
other : he had continued to look at her knowingly more than one, and
nt last he laid down the nut-crackers.
I say,'' said Georgy.
e What do you say'' becky suid, laughing.
You 're the lady I saw in the mass at the Rouge et Noir,''
 Hush 1 you little sly creature,'' Becky said, taking up his hand and
kissing it. `" Your uncle was there too, and mamma mustn't know,''
Of no-not by no means,'' answered the little fellow,
 Yon see we are quite good friends already,'' Becky said to Emmy, who
now re-entered; and it must be owned that Mrs. Osborne had introduced
in most judicious and amiable companion into her house.
William, in a state of great indignation, though still unaware of all
the reason that was in store for him, walked about the town wildly until
he fell upon the Secretary of Legation, Tapeworm, who invited him to
dinner. As they were discussing that meal, he took occasion to ask the
Secretary whether he knew anything about a certain Mrs, Rawdon Crawley,
who had, he believed, made some noise in London; and then Tapeworm,
who of course knew all the London gossip, and was besides a relative of
LAdy Gaunt, poured out into theastonished Major's ears such history about
Becky and her husband as astonished the request, and supplied all the
points of this narrative, for it was at that very table years ago that the
present writer had the pleasure of hearing the tale. Tufto, Steyne, the
Crawleys, and their history-everything connected with Becky and her
previous life passed under the record of the bitter diplomatic. He knew
everything and a great deal besides, about all the world;-in a word, he
made the most astounding revelations to the simple-hearted Major. When
Dobbin said that Mrs. Osborne and Mr. Sedley had taken her into their
house, he burst into a peak of laughter which shocked the Major, and
asked if they ll not better send into the prison, and take in one or two
of the gentlemen in shaved heads and yellow jackets, who swept the
streets of Pumpernickel, chained in pairs, to board and lodge, and act
as tutor to that little scapegrace Georgy.
This information astonished and horrified the MAjor not a little. It had

been agreed in the morning (before meeting with Rebeces) that Amelia
would go to the Court ball that night. There would be the place to tell
her. The Major went home and dressed himself in his uniform, and
repaired to Court, in hopes to see Mrs. Osborne. She never came. When
he returned to his lodgings all the lights in the Sedley tenement were put
out. He could not see her till the morning. I don't know what sort of
a night's rest he had with this frightful secret in bed with him.
At the earliest convenient hour in the morning he sent his servant
across the way with a note, saying, that he wished very particularly to
speak with her. A message came back to say, that Mrs. Osborne was
exceedingly unwell, and was keeping her room.
She, too, had been awake all that night. She had been thinking of a
thing which had agitated her mind a hundred times before. A hundred
times on the point of yielding, she had shrunk back from a sacrifice
which she felt was too much for her. She couldn't, in spite of his love
and constancy, and her own acknowledged regard, respect, and gratitude.
What are benefits, what is constancy, or merit One curl of a girl's
ringlet, one hair of a whisker, will turn the scale against them all in
minute. They did not weigh with Emmy more than with other women.
She had tried them; wanted to make them pass; could not; and the
pitiless little woman had found a pretext, and determined to be free.
When at length, in the afternoon, the Major gained admission to Amelia,
instead of the cordial and affectionate greeting to which he had been
accustomed now for many a long day, he received the salutation ofa
curtsey, and of a little gloved hand, retracted the moment after it was
accorded to him.
Rebecca, too, was in the room, and advanced to meet him with a smile
and an extended hand. Dobbin drew back rather confused. `` I-I beg
your pardon, Ma'am,'' he said; `' but I am bound to tell you that it is not
as your friend that i am come here now,''
pOol damn; don't let us have this sort of thing'' Jos cried out,
alarmed, and anxious to get rid of a scene.
`I wonder what Major Dobbin has to say against Rebecca?'' Amelia
said in a low, clear voice with a slight quiver in it, and a very determined
look about the eyes.
I will not have this sort of thing in my house,'' Jos again interposed.
:I say I will not have it : and Dobbin, I beg, Sir, you 'll stop it.'' And
he looks round trembling and turning very red, and gave a great puff,
and made for his door.
` Dear friend'' Rcbcecas said with angelie sweetness, `` do hear what
Major Dobbin has to say against me.''
:I will not hear it, I say,'' squeak out Jos at the top of his voice,
and, gathering up his dressing-gown, was gone.
`We are only two women,'' Amelia said. ` ou can speak now, Sir.''
 This manner towards me is one which scarcely becomes you, Amelia,''
the Major answered hnughtily; '`nor I believe am I guilty of habitual

Amelia, who was more and more in a pet, The expression of Dobbin's face,
as she spoke in this imperious manner, was not pleasant.
I come to say-and as you stay, Mrs. Crawley, I must say it in your
presence-that I think you-you ought not to form a member of the
family of my friends. A lady who is separated from her husband, who
travels not under her own name, who frequents public gaming-tables--''
It was to the ball I went,'' cried out Becky.
-is not a fit companion for Mrs. Osborne and her son,'' Dobbin went
on : ``and I may and that there are people here who know you, and who
profess to know that regarding your conduct about which I don't even
wish to speak before-before Mrs. Osborne.''
yOur's is a very modest and convenient sort of calumny, Major
Dobbin,'' Rebecca said. :To leave me ruler the weight of an accuse-
tion which, after all, is unsaid. What is it Is it unfaithfulness to my
husband? I scorn it, and defy anybody to prove it-I defy you, I say.
My honour is as untouched as that of the bitterest enemy who ever
maligned me. Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you accuse
meP Yes, i am guilty of those faults, and punished for them every day.
Let me go, Emmy. It is only to suppose that I have not met you, and I
am no worse to-day than IT was yesterday. It is only to suppose that the
night is over and the poor wanderer is on her way. Don't you remember
the song we used to sing in old, dear old days? I have been wandering
eer since then-a poor castaway, scorned for being miserable, and insulted
because I am alone. Let me go: my astsy here interferes with the plans
of this gentleman.''
Indeed it does, Madam,'' said the Major.  If I have any authority
in this house--''
'Authority, novel'' broke out Amelia.  Rebecca, you stay with me.
I won't desert you, because you have been persecuted, or insult you,
because-because Major Dobbin chooses to do so. Come away, dear.''
And the two women made towards their door.
William opened it. As they were going out, however, he took Amelia's
hand, and sail--e Will you stay a moment and speak to me''
 He wishes to speak to you away from me,'' said Becky, looking like
a martyr. Amelia groped her hand in reply.

Mrs. Crawley, as to shut the door upon her. Amelia looked at in,

pause; ``and I missed the word authority.''

yOu don't mean that, Amelia2'' illiam said, sadly. ``You don't
mean that these words, uttered in a hurried moment, are to weigh against
a whole life's devotion. I think that George's memory has not been
injured by the way in which I have dealt with it, and if we are come to
banding reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the mother
of his son. Reflect, afterwards when-when you are at leisure, and your
conscience will withdraw this accusation. It does even now,'' Amelia
held down her head.
It is not that speech of yesterday,'' he continued, ``' which moves you.
That is but the pretext, Amelia, or I have loved you and watched you far
fifteen years in vain. Have l not learned in that time to read all your
feelings, and look into your thoughts I know what your heart is
capable of: it can cling faithfully to a recollection, and cherish a fancy;
but it can't feel such an attachment as mine deserves to mate with, and
such as I would have won from a woman more generous than yon.
No, you are not worthy of the love which I have devoted to you. I knew
all along that the prize I had set my life on was not worth the winning;
that I was a fool, with fond fancies, too, bartering away my all of truth
and armour against your little feeble remnant of love. I will bargain no
more : I withdraw. I find no fault with you. You are very good-
natured, and have done your best; but you couldn't-you couldn't reach
up to the height of the attachment which I bore you, and which as loftier
soul than yours might have been proud to share. Good bye, Amelia I
have watched your struggle. Let it end. We are both weary of it.''
Amelia stood scared and silent as William thus suddenly broke the
chain by which she held him, and declared his independence and supe-
priority. He had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little
woman had been accustomed to trample upon him. She didn't wish to
marry him, but she wished to keep him. She wished to give him nothing,
but that he should give her all. It is a bargain not infrequently levied
in love.
William's sally had quite broken and cast her down. Her assault was
long since over and beaten back.
"Am I to understand then,-that you are going-away,-William 2''
she said.
He gave a sad laugh. `I went one before,'' he said, `' and came back
after twelve years. We were young then, Amelia. Good-bye. I have
spent enough of my life at this play.''
While they had been talking, the door into Mrs. Osborne's room had
opened eer so little; indeed, Becky had kept a hold of the handle
and has turned it on the instant when Dobbin quieted it; and she heard
every word of the conversation that had passed between these two,  What
a noble heart that man has,'' she thought, '` and how shamefully that
woman plays with it,'' She admired Dobbin; she bore him no ranger
for the part he had taken against her. It was an open move in the game,
and played fairly. tAhI'' she thought, `if I could have had such s
husband as that-a man with a heart and brains tool I would not have
minded his large feet;''-and, running into her room, she absolutely
bethought herself of something, and wrote him a note, beseeching him to

with A.
The parting was over. Once more poor William walked to the door
and was gone; and the little widow, the author of all this work, had her
will, and had won her victory, and was left to enjoy it as the best might.
Let the allies envy her triumph.
At the romantic hour of dinner Mr. Georgy made his appearance, and
again remarked the absence of  Old bOb.'' 1he meal was eaten in leduc
by the party; Jos's appetite not being diminished, but Emmy taking
nothing at all.
After the meal, Georgy was rolling in the cushions of the old window,
n large window, with three sides of glass abutting from the table, and
commanding on one side the Market Place, where the Elephant is, and in
front the opposite side of ` Roswell Street over the way,'' like the immortal
casement of Mr, Pickwiek,-Georgy, I say, was rolling in this window,

at the Major's house on the other side of the street.

of the court-yard.'' The `` trap'' in question was a carriage which the
MAjor had bought for six pounds sterling, and about which they used to
rally him a good deal.
Emmy gave a little start but said nothing.

He is-not coming back,'' answered Emmy.

roared out Jos,  Stay, Georgy,'' said his mother, with a very and face.
The boy stopped ; kicked about the room; jumped up and down from the
window-seat with his knees, and showed every symptom of uneasiness and
curiosity.
The horses were put to. The baggage was strapped on. Francis came
out with his master's sword, and cane, and umbrella tied up together, and
laid them in the well, and his desk and old tin cocked-hat case, which he
placed under the sent. Francis brought out the stained old blue clock
lined with rel hamlet, which and wrapped the owner up any time these

rushed down the stairs and flung across the street in a minute-the
yellow position was cracking his whip gently.
William had got into the carriage, released from the embraces of hi
landlord. George bounded in afterwards and flung his arms round the
Major's neck (s they saw from the window), and began asking him
multiplied questions. Then he felt in his waistcoat-pocket and gave him
a note. William seized at it rather eagerly, he opened it trembling, but
instantly his countenance changed, and he tore the paper in two and
dropped it out of the carriage. He kissed Georgy on the lead, and the
boy got out, doubling his fists into his eyes, and with the aid of Francis.
He lingered with his and on the panel. Fort Schwagerl The yellow
position cracked his whip prodigiously, up sprang Francis to the bor,
away went the schimmels, and Dobbin with his head on his breast. He
never looked up as they passed under Abelian's window: and Georgy, let
alone in the street, burst out crying in the face of all the crowd.
Emmy's mail heard him howling again during the night, and brought
him some preserved npricots to console him. She mingled her lament-
tions with his. All the poor, all the humble, all honest folks, all good men
who knew him, loved that kind-hearted and simple gentleman.

dromedary, likes to repose sometimes under the date-trees by the water;
or to come into the cities, walk in the bazaars, refresh himself in the

of his good will. In the course of a week, the civilian was her sworn
slave and frankie admirer. He didn't go to sleep after dinner, as his
custom was, in the much less lively society of Amelia. He drove out
with her in his open carriage. He asked little parties and invented festive-
ties to do her honour. lapeworm, the Secretary of Legation, who had
abused her so cruelly, came to dine with Jos, and then came every day to
pay his respects to Becky. Poor Emmy, who was never very talkative,
and more glum and silent than ever after Dobbin's departure, was quite
forgotten when this superior genius made her appearance. The fRench
Minister was as much charmed with her as his English rival. The

in english people, were delighted with the cleverness and wit of MIrs.

from his lady by one of those trifling differences which are of little account
in a country where  Weather'' is still end, and the  WYhlerwand-

of refusing to receive her in the very highest society of the little duchy,
and the ladies were even more ready to call her d, and to swear eternal
friendship for her, than they had been to bestow the same insatiable
benefits upon Amelia. Love and Liberty are interpreted by those simple
Germans in a way which lowest folks in yorkshire and Somersetshire little

played, sle laughed, she talked in two or three languages, she brought
every body to the house, and the male Jos believe that it was his own

him from the presence of her mistress, she was reconciled to Mrs, Crowley
subsequently, because the latter became William's most ardent admirer
nd champion. And in these mighty conclaes in which the two ladies
indulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne was `` brushing their
'nirs,'' as she called the yellow looks of the one, and the soft brown essence
of the other, this girl always put in her word for that dear good gentleman
Major Dobbin. Her advocacy did not make Amelia angry any mere than
Rebecca's admiration of him. She made George write to him constantly,
and persisted in ending Mann's kind love in a postscript. And as she
looked at her husband's portrait of nights, it no longer reproached her-
perlips she repronched it, now William was gone.
Emmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice. She was very
dieteraite, nervous, silent, and ill to please. The family had never known
her so peevish. She grew pole and ill. She used to try and sing cer-
tain songs, ( Begins bin ich nicht alleine,'' was one of them; that
tender love-song of Weber's, which, in old-fashioned dys, young ladies,
and when you were scarcely born, showed that those who lived before you
knew too how to love and to sing);-certain songs, I say, to which the
Major was partial; and as she enabled them in the twilight in the drawing-
room, she would break off in the midst of the song, and walk into hen
neighbouring apartment, and there, to doubt, take refuge in the miniature
of her husband.
Some books still subsisted, after Dobbin's departure, with his name
written in the; n German dIctionary, for instance, with  William bOb-
bin, -th lcg.,'' in the fly-leaf; a guide-book with his initials, and one or
two other volumes which belonged to the Major. lEmmy cleared these
away, and put them on the drawers, where she placed her work-box, her
desk, her Bible, and Prayer-book, under the pictures of the two Georges.
And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind him, it is a
net that Georgy, rummaging his mother's desk sometime afterwards,
found the gloves neatly rolled up, and put away in what they call the
secret drawers of the desk.
Not caring for society, and moping there a great deal, Emmy's chief
pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with Georgy (during
which Rebecca was left to the society of Mr. Joseph), and then the mother
and son used to talk about the MAjor in a way which ecn made the boy
smile. She told him that she thought Minor William was the best man
in all the world ; the gentlest and the kindest, the bravest, and the humblest.
Over and over again, she told him how they owed everything which they
possessed in the world to that kind friend's benevolent care of them;
how he had befriended them all through their poverty and misfortunes;
watched oer them when nobody cared for them; how all his comrades
admired him though he never spoke of his own gallant actions; how
Georgy's father trusted him beyond all other men, and had been on-
distant befriended by the good William.  Why, when your Papa was
little boy,'' she said,  he often told me that it was William who defended
him against a tyrant at the school where they were; and their friendship
never ceased from that lay until the last, when your car father fell,''

he, Mother When I'm in the army, won't I hate the French:-
that 's all.''
In such colloquial the mother and the child passed a great deal of their
time together. The artless woman had made a confidant of the boy. He
was as much William's friend as everybody else who knew him well.
By the way, Mrs. Becky, not to be behind-hand in sentiment, hal got
n miniature too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amusement
of most people, and the delight of the original, who was no other than
one friend Jos. On her first coming to favour the Sedley with a visit,
the little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably sall shabby kit, was
perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and band-boxes, and often
spoke with great respect about her baggage left behind at Leipzig, which
she must have from that city. WHen a traveller talks to you perpetually
about the splendour of his luggage, which he does not happen to have
with him; my son, beware of that travellers He is, teu to one, an
impostor.
Neither Jos nor Emmy knew this important maxim. It seemed to them
of no consequence whether Becky had a quantity of very ine cities in
invisible trunks; but is her present supply was exceedingly shall,
Emmy supplied her out of her own stores, or took her to the best illiner
in the town, and there fitted her out. It was no more torn collars nos, I
promise you, and faded silks trailing off at the shoulder. Becky changed
her habits with her situation in life-the rouge-pot was suspended-
nuother excitement to which she had accustomed herself was also put aside,
or at least only indulged in in privacy ; as when she was prevailed on by
Jos of a summer evening, EMmy and the boy being absent on their walks,
to take a little spirit-and-water. But if she did not indulge-the courier
lid : that rascal Kirsch could not be kept from the bottle; nor could he
tell how much he took when he applied to it. He was sometimes surprised
himself at the way in which Mr. Sedley's Cognac diminished. Well, well;
this is a painful subject. Becky did not very likely indulge so much as
she used before he entered a enormous family.
At last the much-bragged about boxes arrived from Leipzig ;-three of
them not by any means large or splendid ;-nor did Becky appear to take
out any sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did arrive.
But out of one, which contained a mass of her papers (it was that very
box which nwdon Crawley had ransacked in his furious hunt for Becky's
concealed money), she took a picture with great glue, wsluich she pinned p
in her root, and to which she introduced Jos. It was the portrait of a
gentleman in pencil, his face having the advantage of being painted up in
pink. e was riding on an elephant away from sore cocoa-nut trees, and

Won't you?'' Jos cried, with a look of unutterable rapture and satisfy-
tion. ` Did you really now value it for a sake''
 You know I did, well enough,'' said Becky; `` bUt why speak,-why
think,-why look bulk 1t is too late now I''
That evening's conversation was delicious, for Jos. Emmy only
came in to go to be very tired and unwell. Jos and his fair guest
had a charming tate-i-time and his sister could hear, as she lay awake
in her adjoining chamber, rebecca singing over to Jos the old song
of 1815. He did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, and more than
Amelia.
It was June, and, y consequence, high season in London,; Jos, who
read the incomparable '' Malignant'' (the exile's best forceful) through every
la, used to favour the ladies with extracts from his paper during their
breakfast. Every week in this paper there is a full account of military
movements, in which Jos, as a man who had seen service, was especially
interested. On one occasion he read out-`Arrival of the -th regiment.
-Gravesend, June 20.-The llamchunder, Fast Indians, came into the
river this morning, having on board 14 officers, and 132 rank and file
of this gallant corps. They have been absent from england 14 years,
having been entered the year after Waterloo, in which glorious conflict
they took an active part, and having subsequently distinguished them-
see in the Burmese war. The veteran colonel, Sir Michael O'Dowd,
K.C.bB., with is lady and sister, funded here yesterday, with Captains
sky, Stubble, Matters, Maloney: lieutenant Smith, Jones, Thopsen,
. Thomson; Ensigus Hicks and Grady; the band on the pier playing
the national anthem, and the crowd loudly cheering the gallant veterans
as they went into Wayne's hotel, where a sumptuous banquet was provided
for the defenders of Old England. During the repast, which we need not
say was servcl up in Wayne's best style, the clearing continued so
enthusiastically, that Lady O'Down and the Colonel came forward to the
balcony, and drank the health of the fellow-countrymen in a bumper of
Whyte's best claret.''
On a second occasion Jos rend a brief announcement-MAjor Dobbin hal
joined the-th regiment at Chatham; and subsequently he regulated
accounts of the presentations at the Drawing-room, of Colonel Sir
Michael O'Down, K.C.lB., Indy O'Dowd (by Mrs. Miolloy Million ol
Ballymalony), anl Miss Gloria O'Dowd (by Lady O'DOwd). Almost
directly after this, Dobbin's name appeared among the Lieutenant-
Colonels : for old Marshal Tiptoff had died during the passage of the
--th from Mars, and the Sovereign was pleased to advance Colonel Sir
Michael O'Down to the rank of Major-General on his return to England,
with an intimation that he should be Colonel of the distinguished regiment
which he had so long commanded.

correspondence between George and his guardian had not ceased by any
menus: William had even written once or twice to her since his departure,
but in a manner so uneonstrainedly cold, that the poor woman felt now in her
turn that she had lost her power over him, and that, as he had said, he was
free. he had left her, and she was wretched. The memory of his almost
countless services, and lofty and affectionate regard, now presented itself
to her, and rebuke hcr day and night. She brooded over those college-
tions according to her wont; saw the purity and beauty of the affection
with which she had trifled, and reproaehed herself for having lung away
such a treasure.
It was gone indeed. William lad spent it all out. He loved her no
more, he thought, as he had loved her. He never could again. That
sort of regard, which he lal proffered to her for so many faithful cars, can't
be flung down and shattered, and mended so as to show no scars. The
title needless tyrant hal so destroyed it. No, William thought again
and again, `` It was myself I deluded, and persisted in cooling: iad she
been worthy of the love I gave her, she would have returned it long ago.
It was a fond mistake. Isn't the whole course of life made up of such
and suppose I and won her, should I not have been disenchanted the day
after my victory Why pine, or be ashamed of my defeat?'' The more
he thought of this long passage of his life, the more clearly he saw his
deception. ``1'll go into harness again,'' he said, ``and do my duty in that
state of life in which it has pleased Heaven to place me. I will see that the
buttons of the recruits aro properly bright, and that the sergeants make
no mistakes in their accounts. I will dine at mess, and listen to the
Scotch surgeon telling his stories. When I am old and broke, I will go
on half-pay, and my old sisters shall scold me. I have ` geliebt aud

After June all the little Court Society of Pumpernickel used to sepa-
rate, according to the German plan, and make for a hundred watering-
places, where they drank at the wells; rode upon donkeys; gnmbled at the
reontes, if they had money and a mind; rushed with hundreds of their
king, to grandiose at the tales d '6dte , and idled away the summer. The
eNglish diplomtists went off to teplitz and Missing, their French rivals
shut up their clanucellerie and whisked away to their darling Boulevard de
And. The Transparent reigning family took, too, to the waters, or retired
to their hunting-lodges. Everybody went away having any pretensions

Doctor, and his Bhroness. The seasons for the baths were the most produce-

tive periods of the Doctor's practice-he united business with pleasure,
and his chief place of resort was Ostend, which is much frequented by
Germans, and where the dOctor treated himself and his spouse to what he
called a `'die'' in the sea.
His interesting patient, Jos, was a regular milch cow to the Doctor, and he
easily persuaded the civilian, both for his own health's sake and that of his
charming sister, which was really very much scattered, to pass the summer
at that hideous seaport town. eMmy did not care where she went much
Georgy jupel at the idea of a move. As for l3becky, she came as a
natter of course in the fourth place inside of the fine barouche Mr. Jos had
bought: the two domestic being on the box in Front. She might have
some misgivings about the friends whom she should meet there, and who
might be likely to tell ugly stories-but, bahl she was strong enough to hold
her own. She had cast such an anchor in Jos now as would require a strong
storm to she. That incident of the picture nhl finished him. Becky
took down her elephant, and put it into the little box which she had had
from Amelia ever so many years ago. Emmy also came off with her Lares,
-her two pictures,-and the party, finally, were lodged in an exceedingly
car and uncomfortable house at Posted.
There Amelia began to take baths, nl get what good she could from
them, and though scores of people of Becky's nequaiutance passed er and
cut her, yet Mrs. Osborne, who walked about with her, and who know
nobody, was not aware of the treatment experienced by the friend whom
she had chosen so judicious as a companion ; indeed, Becky never thought
it to tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes.
sOme of MIrs. Rawdon Crawley's acquaintances, however, acknowledged
her readily cough,-perhaps more readily than she would have desired.
Among these were Major Loder (unattachel), and Action Rook (late of the
Titles), who might be seen any day on the Dyke, smoking and staring
at the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable
board and select circle of Mr. Joseph Sedley. In fact, they would
take no denial; they burst into the house whether Becky was at home or
not, walked into MIrs. Osborne's drawing-room, which they perfumed with
their coats nnl pistachios, called Jos : Old buck,'' and invaded lis
dinner-table, and laughed and drank for long hours there.
 What can they mean'' asked Georgy, who did not like these gentle-
men. `I heard the Major say to Mrs. Crawley yesterday, ` No,no, bEcky,
you shan't keep the old buck to yourself, We must have the bones in,
or, emmy, 1 'll split.' What could the MAjor mean, MIa2''
v Major don't call Mim Major'' may said. I 'm sure I can't
tell what he meant.'' His presence and that of his friend inspired the
little lady with intolerable terror and aversion. They paid her tipsy com-
patients; they veered at her over the dinner-table. and the Captain made
her advances that filled her with sickening dismay, nor would she ever see
him unless she and George by her side.
Rebecca, also, to do her justice, never would let either of these men
remain alone with Amelia; the Major was disengaged too, and swore he
would be the winner of her. A couple of ruffians were fighting for this

innocent creature, gambling for her at her own table; and though she
was not aware of the rascals' designs upon her, yet she felt a horror and
uneasiness in their presence, and longed to fly.
Sle besonght, she entrealed Jos to come home. Not he. It was
low of movement, tied to his Doctor, and perhaps to some other leading-
things. At least Becky s not anxious to go to England.
At last she took a great resolution-made the great plunge. She wrote
of a letter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water; a
letter about which she did not speak a word to anybody, which she carried
herself to the post under her shawl, nor was any remark made about it;
july that she looked very much flushed and agitated when Georgy met
her ; and she kissed him al hung over him a great deal that night. She
did not come out of her room after her return from her walk. Becky
thought it was MInor Loder and the Captain who frightened her.
`She mustn 't stop here,'' Becky reasoned with herself, `She must go
away, the silly little fool. She is still whimpering after that gay ofa
husband-dead, (and served right.) these fifteen years. She shan't marry
either of these men. It's too bad of Loder. No; he shall marry the
bamboo-cne, I 'll settle it this very night.''
So Rocky took a cup of tea to Mmelin in her private apartment, and
found that lady in the company of her miniatures, and in a most melancholy
and nervous condition. She laid down the cup of tea.
Thank you,'' said Amelia.
 LIsten to me, Amelia,'' said becky, marching up and down the room
before the other, and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous kindness.
I want to talk you. You must go away from here and from the period-
fences of these men. I won't have you harassed by them; and they will
insult you if you stay. I tell you they are rascals; men fit to send to the
hulks. Never mind how I know them. I know everybody. Jos can't

casting, but I could 'not forget -;'' and she finished the sentence by
looking up at the portrait.

after he married you.''

and taking a little paper out of her belt, she opened it and lung it into
Emmy's lsp. ` You know his hand-writing. He wrote that the-wanted
me to run away with him-gave it me under your nose, the day before
he was shot-and served him right.'' Becky repeated.
Emmy did not hear her; she was looking at the letter. It was the
which George had put into the bouquet and given to Becky on the right
of the Duke of kiclunond's ball. It was as she said : the foolish young
man hal asked her to fly.
Emmy's head sank down, and for almost the last time in which she shall
be called upon to keep in this history, she commenced that work. Her
head fell to her bosom, and her hands went up to her eyes; and there for
while, she gave way to her emotions, as BEcky stood on and regarded her.
WHo shall analyse those tears, and say whether they were sweet or
bitter Was the most grieve, because the idol of her life was tumbled
down and shivered ut her feet, or indignant that scr love had been so
despised, or glad because the barrier was removed which modesty had
placed between her and a new, a real affection ` There is nothing to
forbid me now,'' she thought.  lI may love him with all my heart now.
O, I will, I will, if he will but let me, and forgive me.'' I believe it was
this feeling rushed over all the others which agitated that gentle little
bosom.
Indeed, she did not cry so much as Becky expected-the other loathed
and kissed her-a rare mark of sympathy with Mrs. Becky. Sle treated
Emmy like a child, and patted her head. ``And now let us gct pen and
ink, aid write to him to come this minute,'' she said.
'I-I wrote to him this morning,'' Emmy soil, blushing exceedingly.
Becky screamed with laughter-` U iglielto,'' she sang out with
Rosina, `' color ua /''-the-whole house echoed with her still singing.
Two mornings after this little scene, although the day was rainy and
gusty, and Amelia had had in exceedingly wankel night, listening to the
wind roaring, and pitying all travellers by land and by water, act she got
p early, and insisted upon taking a walk on the Dyke with Georgy; and
there she named as the rain but into her face, and she looked out west-
ward across the dark sea line, and over the swollen billows which came
tumbling and farthing to the shore. Neither spoke much, except now
and then, when the boy said new words to his timid companion, indicative
of sympathy and protection.
iI hope he won't cross in such weather,'' Emmy said.
:I et ten to one he does,'' the boy answered.  Look, mother,
there's the smoke of the steamer,'' It was that signal, sure enough.
But though the steamer was under weigh, he might not be on board;
he might not have got the letter; he might not choose to come.-Hundred
fears poured one over the other into the little heart, as fast as the waves
on to the Dyke.
The boat followed the smoke into sight. Georgy had a dandy telescope,
and got the vessel under view in the most skilful manner. And he made

and down before her eyes.

Of course he would come: what could he do else but come She knew
he would come.
The ship came swiftly nearer and nearer. As they went in to mel

scarcely could run. She would have liked to kneel down and say lr
prayers of thanks there. Oh, she thought, she would be all her lit

It was such n and day that as the vessel came alongside of the way
there were no idlers abroad; scarcely even a commissioner on the look-out
for the few passengers in the steamer. That young scape-grace George
had fled too: and as the gentleman in the old cloak lined with red stu
stepped on to the short, there was scarcely any one present to see what
took place, which was briefly this:
A lady in a dripping white bonnet and seal, with her two little han
ont before he, went up to him, and in the next minute she had altogether
disappeared under the folds of the old cook, and was kissing one of his
hands with all her might; whilst the other, I suppose, was changed in
holding her to his heart (which her had just about reached) and in pre-
venting her from tumbling down. She was murmuring something abou
-forgive-lens William-denr, dear, nearest friend-kiss, kiss, kiss, an.
so forth-and in fact went on under the cloak in an absurd manner.
Won Emmy emerged from it, she still kept tight hold of one of:
William's hands, nnl looked up in his face. It was full of sadness nnl
tender love and pity. She understood its reproach, and hung don
her head.
It was time you sent for me, dear Amelia,'' le said.

tO, never,'' he answered: and pressed the dear little soil once more
to his heart.
As they issued out of the Custom-house precincts, Georgy broke out of
them, with his telescope up to his eye, and a loud laugh of welcome; he
danced round the couple, and performed many facetious antics as he lel

Perhaps it was compunction towards the kind and simple creature, who
had been the first in life to defend her, perhaps it was a dislike to all such
sentimental scenes,-but Rebecca, satisfied with her part in the transaction,
never presented herself before Colonel Dobbin and the lady whom he
married. ``Particular business,'' she said, took her to Bruges, without
she went; and only Georgy and his uncle were present at the marriage
ceremony. When it was over, and deorgy had rejoined his parents, Mrs.
bEcky returned (just for a few days) to comfort the solitary bachelor
Joseph Sedley. He preferred a continental life, he said, and declined to
join in housekeeping with his sister and her husband.

At present it is Gloria l'sky (now Mrs. Major Porky), she took him

He was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that catastrophe, failed in
his health, and prophesied the speedy ruin of the Empire.
Ludy Jane and MIrs. Dobbin became great friends-there was a perpetual
crossing of pour-chases between the Hall and the Evergreens, the Clo-
nel's place (rented of his friend Major Onto, who was nbrond with his
family.) Her Ladyship was godmother to Mrs. Dobbin's child, which
bore her name, and we christened by the Rev. James Crawley, wha
succeeded his father in the living: and a pretty close friendship subsisted
between the two ends, George and Rawdon, who hunted and shot together
in the actions, were both entered of the same College at Cambridge, and
quarrelled with each other about Lady Jane's daughter, with whom they
were both, of course, in love. A match between George and that young
ludy was long a favourite scheme of both the matrons, though I have heard
that MIss Crawley herself inclined towards her cousin.
Mrs. awdon Crawley's name was never mentioned by either family.
There were reasons why all should be silent regarding her. For wherever
Mr. Joseph Sedley west, she travelled likewise; and that infatuated man
seemed to be entirely her slate. The Colonel's lawyers informed him that
his brother-in-law had effected n leave insurance upon his life, whence it
as probable that he had been raising money to discharge debts. IIe

indeed his infirmities were daily increasing.
On hearing the news about the insurance, Amelia, in a good deal of
alarm, entreated her husband to go to Brussels, where Jos then was, and
inquire into the state of his first. The Colonel quieted home with
reluctance (For he was deeply immersed in his ' HIstory of the Punjab,''
while still occupies him, and much alarmed about his little daughter,
whom he idolizes, and who was just recovering from the chicken-pox), and
went to Brussels and found Jos living at one of the enormous hotels in
that city. Mrs, Crawley, who had her carriage, gave entertainments, and
lived in a very genteel manner, occupied another suite of apartments in the
same hotel.
The Colonel, of course, did not desire to see that lady, or even think
proper to notify his arrival at Brussels, except privately to Jos by a
message through his valet. Jos begged the Colonel to come and see him
that night, when Mrs. Crawley would be at a career, and when they could
meet alone. He found his brother-in-law in a condition of printable infer-
city; and dreadfully afraid of Rebecca, though eager in his praises of her.
She tended him through a series of unheard-of illnesses, with a fidelity
most admirable. She had been a daughter to him.  But-but-oh fon
Go's sake, do come and live near me, and-and-see me sometimes,''
whispered out the unfortunate man.
The Colonel's brow darkened at this. We can't, Jos,'' he said.
' Considering the circumstances, Amelia can't visit you.''
I swear to you-I swear to you on the Bible,'' gasped out Joseph,

wanting to kiss the book, `` that she is as innocent as a child, as spotless
as your own wife,''
 It may be so,'' said the Colonel, gloomily; ``but Emmy can't come
to you. Be a man, Jos: break off this disreputable connexion. Come
home to your family. We hear your affairs are involved.''

money is placed out most advantageously. rs. Crawley-that is-I
mean,-it is laid out to the best interest.''

 I thought-a little present to her-in case anything happened ; and
you know my health is so delicate-common gratitude you kno-and I
intend to leave all my huey to you-and I can spare it out of my income,
indeed Ican,'' tried oit William's weak brother-in-law.
The Colonel hesought os to fly at one-to go hook to India, whither
MIrs. Crawley could not follow him; to do anything to breakout a con-
union which might have the best fatal consequences to him.
Jos clasped his hands, and said,- He would go back to India.  He
would do anything: nly he must have time: they must'nt sny anything
to MIrs. Crawley :-he'd-she'd kill me if who knew it. you don't know
what a terrible woman she is,'' the poor wreteh said.
 Then, why net meme away with me'' sid Robin in reply; but Jos
had not the courage.'  He would see Dobbin again in the morning; he
must on no account say thathe had been there. ke mhuit go now. Becky
might come in.'' And Dabbin fitted lim full of forebodings.
He never saw los more. Three months afterwards Joseph iSedley died at
Aix-la-Chapelle. It was found that all his property lad been muddled away
in speculations, and was represented by valueless shares in different bubble
companies. All his available assets vote the two thousand pounds for
which his life was insured, and which were left equally between his beloved
``sister Amelia, wife of, &c., and his friend and invaluable attendant during
sickness, Rebecca, wife of Lieutenant-Colonel lawson Crawley, CB.,'' who
was appointed administration.
The solicitor of the Insurance Company swore it was the blackest case
that ever had come before him; talked of sending a commission to Six to
same into the death, and the Company reused parent of the policy.
But Mrs., or Lady Crawley, s she slylecl herself, came to town at one
(attended with her solicitors, Messrs. Burke, Thurtell, and Always, ot
Thavies Inn,) and dared the Company to refuse the payment. They invited
examination. they declared that she was the object of an infamous conspiracy,
which has been pursuing her all through life, and triumphed finally. The
money was paid, and her character established, but Colonel Dobbin sent
back his share of the legacy to the Insurance Offios, and rigidly declined to
hold any communion with Rebecca.
She never was Lady Crawley, though she continued so to call herself.
His Excellency Colonel Rawdon Crsley died of yellow fever st Coventry
Island, most deeply beloved and deplored, and six weeks before the demise
of his brother, Sir Pitt. The estate consequently doled upon the
present Sir Rawdon Crawley, Bart.

CITY FAIR.
He, too, has declined to see his mother, to whom he makes a liberal allow-
once; and who, besides, appears to be very wealthy. The Baronet lives
entirely at queen's Crawley, with Lady Jane and her daughter; whilst
rebecca, Lady Crawley, chiefly hangs about Bath and Cheltenham, where a
very strong party of excellent people consider her to be a most injured
woman. She has her enemies. Who has not Her life is her answer to
them. She busied herself in works of piety. She goes to church, and never
without a footman. Her name is in all the Clarity Lists. The Destitute
Rouge-girl, the Neglected Washerroman, the Distressed Muffin-man, find
in her u fast and generous friend. She is always having atolls at Fancy
1Fairs for the benefit of these hapless beings. Emmy, her children, and the
Colonel, coming to London some time back, found themselves suddenly
before her at one of these fairs. She cast down her eyes securely and
smiled as they started away from her; Emmy skurrying off on the arm of
George, (now grown a dashing young gentleman,) and the Colonel seizing
up his little Janey, of whom he is fonder than of anything in the world-
single even than of his ` History of the Punjab.''
Fonder than he is of me,'' Emmy thinks, with a sigh. But he never
said a word to Amelia that was not kind and gentle; or thought of a
want of her that he did not try to gratify.
AhI anita Panitatan  Which of us is happy in this world Which
of us has his desire or, having it, is satisfied 2-Come children, let us
set up the box and the puppets, for our play is played out.
