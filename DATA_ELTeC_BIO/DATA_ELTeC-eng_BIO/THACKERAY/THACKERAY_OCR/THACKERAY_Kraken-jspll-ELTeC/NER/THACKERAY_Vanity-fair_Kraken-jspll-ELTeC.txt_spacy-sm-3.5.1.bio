Mr. O

Some O
cynical O
Frenchman B-NORP

has O
said O
that O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
parties O
to O
a O

transaction O
: O
the O
one O
who O
loves O

and O
the O
other O
who O
condescend O
to O
be O
so O
treated O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
love O
is O
|
| O
occasionally O
on O
the O
man O
's O
side O
: O
perhaps O
on O
the O
lady O

. O
Perhaps O
some O

infatuated O
swain O
has O
ere O

mistaken O
insensibility O
for O
modesty O
, O

admired O
his O

as O
manly O

worshipped O
his O

is O

treated O
his O

little O

looks O

the O

was O
so O
like O
his O

, O
that O
the O
widow O
's O
|
| O
heart O
thrilled O
as O
she O
held O
him O
to O
it O
; O
and O
he O
would O
often O
ask O
the O
cause O
|
| O
of O
her O
tears O
. O
It O
was O
because O
of O
his O
likeness O
to O
his O
father O
, O
she O
did O
not O
|

scruple O
to O

him O

She O
talked O
constantly O
to O
him O
about O
this O
dead O
father O
, O
|
| O
and O
spoke O
of O
her O
love O
for O
George B-PERSON
to O
the O
innocent O
and O
wondering O
child O
; O
|
| O
much O
more O
than O
she O
her O
had O
done O
to O
George B-PERSON
himself O
, O
or O
to O
any O
confidante O

of O
her O

To O

she O
never O

matter O
: O
shrink- O

ing O
from O
bring O
her O
heart O
to O
them O
. O
Little O
George B-PERSON
very O
likely O
could O
under- O
|
| O
stand O
no O
better O
than O
the O
; O
but O
into O
his O
ears O
she O
poured O
her O
sentimental O
|
| O
secrets O
unreservedly O
, O
and O
into O
his O
only O
. O
The O
very O
joy O
of O
this O
woman O
was O
|
| O
a O
sort O
of O
grief O
, O
or O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
its O
expression O
was O
tears O
. O
Her O
|
| O
sensihilities O
were O
so O
weak O
and O
tremulous O
, O
that O
perhaps O
they O
ought O
not O
to O
|
| O
be O
talked O
about O
in O
a O
book O
. O
I O
was O
told O
by O
Dr. O
Pestler B-PERSON
, O
( O
now O
a O
most O
|
| O
flourishing O
lady O
's O
physician O
, O
with O
a O
impetuous O
dark O
- O
green O
carriage O
, O
a O
prose- O
|
| O
pent O
of O
speedy O
knighthood O
, O
and O
a O
house O
in O
Manchester B-GPE
square O
, O
) O
that O
her O
|
| O
grief O
at O
weaning O
the O
child O
was O
a O
sight O
that O
would O
have O
unmanned O
a O
Herod B-PERSON
. O
|
| O
He O
was O
very O
soft O
- O
hearted O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
and O
his O
wife O
was O
mortally O
jealous O
|
| O
of O
Mrs. O
Amelia B-PERSON
, O
then O
and O
long O
afterwards O
. O
|
| O
Perhaps O
the O
Doctor O
's O
lady O
had O
good O
reason O
for O
her O
jealousy O
: O
most O
|
| O
women O
shared O
it O
, O
of O
those O
who O
formed O
the O
small O
circle O
of O
Amelia B-GPE
's O
|
| O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
were O
quite O
angry O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
the O
|
| O
other O
sex O
regarded O
her O
. O
For O
almost O
all O
men O
who O
came O
near O
her O
loved O
|
| O
her O
; O
though O
no O
doubt O
they O
would O
be O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
She O
was O
|
| O
not O
brilliant O
, O
nor O
witty O
, O
nor O
wise O
overcome O
, O
nor O
extraordinarily O
handsome O
. O
|
| O
But O
wherever O
she O
went O
she O
touched O
and O
charmed O
eery O
one O
of O
the O
male O
|
| O
sex O
, O
as O
invariably O
as O
she O
awakened O
the O
scorn O
and O
incredulity O
of O
her O
own O
|
| O
sisterhood O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
her O
weakness O
which O
was O
her O
principal O
charm:- O
|
| O
a O
kind O
of O
sweet O
submission O
and O
softness O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
appeal O
to O
each O
|
| O
man O
she O
met O
for O
his O
sympathy O
and O
protection O
. O
We O
have O
seen O
how O
in O
the O

though O
she O
spoke O

to O
few O
of O

all O
the O

words O

that O

; O
it O
is O

probable O
that O

not O

; O
if O
, O
on O

a O

should O
find O
himself O
at O
your O
refined O

polite O
tea- O

where O
everybody O
was O
saying O
witty O

everybody O
of O

and O
repute O
tearing O
her O
friends O
to O
pieces O
in O
the O
most O
delightful O
manner O
, O
it O
|
| O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
stranger O
would O
not O
be O
very O
talkative O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
|
| O
interesting O
or O
interested O
. O
|
| O
And O
it O
must O
be O
remembered O
, O
that O
this O
poor O

never O
met O
a O
gentle- O

Perhaps O

not O

elevated O

whose O
