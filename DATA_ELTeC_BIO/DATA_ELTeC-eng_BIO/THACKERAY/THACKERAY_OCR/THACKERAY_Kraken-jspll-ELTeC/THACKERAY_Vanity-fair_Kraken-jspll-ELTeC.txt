BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
As the MAnager of the Performance sits before the
curtain on the bonds, and looks into the Fair, a feeling of
profound melancholy comes over him in his survey of the
bustling place. There is a great quantity of eating'and drink-
ing, making love and jilting, laughing and the contrary,
smoking, cheating, fighting, dancing, and fiddling: there are
bullies pushing about, backs going the women, knaves picking
pockets, policemen on the look-out, quacks (other quacks,
plague take them l) bawling in front of their booths, and yokels
looking up at the tinselled dancers and poor old roused
tumblers, while the light-fingered folk are overrating upon their
pockets behind. Yes, this is VErY FAIn; not a moral place
certainly; nor a merry one, though very noisy. Look at the
faces of the actors and buffoons when they come off from their
business; and Tom Fool washing the paint off his cheeks before
he sits down to dinner with his wife and the little Jack
Puddings behind the canvas. The curtain will be up presently,
and he will be turning over head and heels, and crying,
How are you of ''
A man with a reflective turn of mind, walking through
viii
BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
an exhibition of tis sort, will not be oppressed, I take it, by
his own or other people's hilarity. An episode of humour or
kindness touches and amuses him here and there;-a pretty
child looking at a gingerbread stall; a pretty girl blushing
whilst her lover talks to her and chooses her fairing; poor Tom
Fool, yonder behind the waggon, mumbling his bone with the
honest family which lives by his tumbling;-but the general
impression is one more melancholy than mirthful. When you
come home, you sit down, in a sober, contemplative, not
unchnaritable frame of mind, and apply yourself to your books
or your business.
I have no other moral than this to tag to the present
story of  Vanity Fair'' Some people consider Fairs immoral
altogether, and esther such, with their servants and families:
perhaps they are right. But persons who think otherwise and
are of a day, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood, may perhaps
like to step in for half an hour and look at the performauces.
There are scenes of all sorts; some dreadful combat, some
grand and lofty horse-riding, some scenes of high life, and some
of very middling indeed; some love making for the sentimental,
and some light comic business: the whole accompanied by
appropriate scenery, and brilliantly illuminated with the
Author's own candles.
What more has the Manager of the Performance to say ?'-
To acknowledge the kindness with which it has been received
in all the principal towns of England through which the Show
has passed, and where it has been most favourably noticed
by the respected conductors of the Public Press, and by the
Nobility and Gently. He is proud to think that his Puppets
have given satisfaction to the very best company in this empire.
BEFORE THE CURTAIN.
The famous little Beck Puppet was been pronounced to be
uncommonly flexible in the joints and lively on the wire: the
Amelia Doll, though it has had a smaller circle of admirers,
has yet been cared and dressed with the greatest care by
the artist : the Doing Figure, though apparently clumsy, yet
dances in a very amusing and natural manner: the Little Boys'
Dance has been liked by some; and please to remark the richly
dressed figure of the Wicked Nobleman, on which no expense
has been spared, and which Old Nick will fetch away at the
end of this singular performance.
And with this, and a profound bow to his patrons, the
MAnager retires, and the curtain rises.

its teens, and on one sun-sliny
morning in June, there drove
up to the great iron gate of Miss
Pinkerton's academy for young
Ladies, on Chiswick Mall, a large
family coach, with two but horses
in blazing harness, driven by a
fat coachman in a three-cornered
hat and wig, at the rate of four
miles an hour. A black servant,
who reposed on the box beside
the fat coachman, uncurled his
bandy legs as soon as the equi-
page drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's shining brass plate, and s he
pulled the bell, at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of
the narrow windows of the stately old brick house. Nay, the acute
observer might have recognised the little red nose of good-naturel Miss
Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising her some geranium-pots in the window
of that lady's own drawing-room.
' It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister,'' said Miss Jemima. About, the
black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman has a new red
waistcoat.''
` Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss
Bedley's departure, Miss Jemima P'' asked Miss Pinkerton herself, that
majestic lady: the emiramis of HAmmersmith, the friend of Doctor
Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Chapter herself.
 The girls were up at four this morning, packing her trunks, sister,'i
replies Miss Jemima; '`we have made her a bow-pot.''
vANITY FAIR.
 Say a bouquet, sister Jemima, 'tis more genteel.''
 Well, a book as big almost as a hay-stack; I have put up two
bottles of the gillyflower-water for Mrs. Sedley, and the receipt for
making it, in Amelia's for.''
''And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of Miss Sedley's

account. This is it, is it Very good-ninety-three pounds, four soil-
lines. Be kind enough to address it to John Surely, Squire, and to see
this billet which I have written to his lady.''
In Mias Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister, Miss Pinker-
ton, was an object of as deep veneration, as would have been a letter from
a sovereign. Only when her pupils quitted the establishment, or when
they were about to be married, and once, when poor Miss Birch died of
the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to write personally to the
parents of her pupils; and it was Jemima's opinion that if anything cold
console Mrs. Birch for her daughter's loss, it would be that pious and
eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced the event.
In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's `` illet'' was to the following
effect:-
 7he Mall, Oliseick, Runs 15, 168-.
` MAx,-After her six years' residence at the Man, I have the
honour and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Coldly to her parents,
I

as a young lady not worthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished
and refined circle. Those virtues which charucterise the young English
gentlewoman, those accomplishments which become her birth and station,
will not be found wanting in the amiable Miss Seller, whose induaftry
and obedience hae endeared her to her instructors, and whose delightful
sweetness of temper has charmed her aged and her fulfil companions.
'`In music, in dancing, in orthography, in every variety of embroidery
and needle-work, she will be found to have realised her friends' felt
wishes. In geography there is still much to be desired; and a careful
and undeviating use of the backward, for four hours daily during the
next three years, is recommended as necessary to the acquirements of that
dignified deportment and carriage, so requisite for every young lady of fashion.
 In the principles of religion und norality, Miss edley will be found
worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence o1
The Great Leicograpler, and the patronage of the ndmirnbhle Mrs. Cha-
one. In leaving the MIll, Miss Anelia carries with her the hearts of her
companions, and the affectionate regards of her mistress, who has the
honour to subscribe herself,
Madam,
 Your most obliged humble servant,
BAZAAR OPINION.''
uP.S. Miss Sharp accompanies Miss Sedley. It is particularly re-
guessed that Miss Sharp's stay in lussell Square may not exult ten days.
The family ol distinction with whom she is engaged, desire to avail them-
sexes of her services as soon as possible,''
The letter completed, Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name,
and Miss Sedley's, in the fly-leaf of a Johnson's Dictionnry-the inter-
resting work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on their
departure from the Mill. On the cover was inserted a copy of `` Lines
addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton's school, at the
Mill ; by the late revered Doctor Tumult Johnson.'' In fact, the Life-
cographer's name was always on the lips of this majestic woman, and a
visit he had said to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune.
Being commanded by her elder sister to get ``the Dictionary'' from the
cupboard, Miss Jemims he extractcd two copies of the hook from the
receptale in question. When Miss Pinkerton had finished the kinship-
lion in the first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air, handed her
the second.
 or whom is this, Miss Jemima ?'' said Miss Pinkerton, with awful
coldness.
 or Beck Sharp,'' answered Jemima, trembling very much, and
blushing over her withered face and neck, as she turned her back on
her sister. For Black Sharp : she's going too.''
MISS JEMIMA .'' exelsimcd Miss Pinkerton, in to largest eapitals.
``Are you in your senses? Replace the Ordinary in the closed, and never
venture to take such a liberty in future.''
II, sister, it's only two-and-ninepenny, and poor Beck will be
miserable if she won't get one.''
n 2
VANITY SAId.
Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,'' said Miss Pinkerton. And so
picturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly
tlurried and nervous.
MIss Sedley's papa was a merchant in London, nail s man of some
cattle; whereas Miss Sharp was an article pupil, for whom Miss ink-
erton had done, as she thought, quite enough, without concerning upon her
at parting, the high honour of the bDixonary.
Although Schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more nor less
than churchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person
lepurts this life, who is really dcserving of all the rises the stone-cutter
canvas over his bones; who is a good Christian, a good parent, child, wife or
husband; who actually does leave a disconsolute family to mourn his loss;
so in academies of the male and female sex it course eery now and then,
that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bestowed by the disinterested
instructor. Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular
species; and deserved not only all that Miss linkerton said in her praise, 
but had many charming qualities which that pompous old Minervn of a
woman could not see, from the differences of rank and age between her
pupil and herself.
For she could not only sing like a lark, or a Mrs. Billington, and dance
like Hillisberg or 'artist; and embroidery beauntifully; and spell as well as
the Ordinary itself; but she had such a kindly, smiling, tender, gentle,
generous heart of her own, no won the love of everybody who came near
her, from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery, and the
one-eyed tartwoman's daughter, who was permitted to send her wares once
a week to the young ladies in the Mall. She had twelve intimate and
bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies. Even envious Miss
Brings never spoke ill of her: high and mighty Miss Stirred (Lord Esther's
grand-daughter) allowed that her figure was genteel: and as for MIss
not, the rich woolly-haired mutton from S5t. Pitt's, on the day Ameclia
went away, she was in such a passion of tears, that they were obliged to
send for Dr. TOssed, and half satisfy her with salvolatile. Miss Pinkerton's
uttachcnt was, as may be supposed, from the high position and eminent
virtues of that lady, calm mud dignified; but Miss Jemima had already
blubberecl several times at the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear
of her sister, would have gone off in downright hysterics, like the heroes
(who pail double) of St. Pitt's. Such luxury of grief, however, is only
allowed to parlour-boarders. Honest Jemima lad ull te bills, and the
washing, and the mendiug, and the puddings, and the place and mockery,
and the servants to superintend. But why speak about her It is
probable that we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end
of time, and that when the great filligrec iron gates are once closed on
her, she and her awful sister will never issue tlerefrom into this little
world of history.
But as we are to see a great deal of Amelia, there is no harm in saying
at the outset of our acquaintance, that she was one of the best and denrest
creatures that ever lived; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in
novels, which (and the latter especially) bound in villains of the most
sombre sort, that we are to have for n constant companion, so guilelcss

and good-naturel a person. As she is not a heroine, there is no need to
describe her person ; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short
than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a
heroine; but her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the
freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes, which sparkled with the
brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled with
tears, and that was a great deal too often ; for the silly thing would cry
over a dead canary-bird, or over a mouse, that the cat happy had seized
upon, or over the end of a novel, were it ever so stupid; and as for saying
an unkind word to her, were any one hard-hearted enough to do so,-
why, so much the worse for them. Even Miss Pinkerton, the austere
and god-like woman, ceased scolding cr after the first time, and though
she no more comprehended sensibility than she did Algebra, gave all
masters and teachers particular orders to treat Miss Sedley with the utmost
gentleness, as harsh treatment was injurious to her.
So that when the day of departure me, between her two customs of
laughing and crying, Miss Sedley was greatly puzzled how tact. She was
glad to go home, and yet most wofully sad at leaving school. For nature
days before, little Lnura Martin, the orphan, followed her about, like a
little dog. She had to take and receive at least fourteen presents,-to
make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week: ``Send my letters
under cover to my grandpapa, the Earl of Dexter,'' said Miss Saltire (who,
by the way was rather shabby) : `` Never mind the posture, but write every
day, you dear darling,'' said the impetuous and woolly-headed, but gone-
out and affectionate Miss Swurtz; and little Laura Martin (who was just
in round hand) took her friend's land and said, looking up in her face
wistfully, `Amelia, when I write to you I slull call you Mamma.'' Al

will pronounce to be excessively foolish, trivial, waddling, and ultra-sent-
mental. as; I can see Tones at this minute (rather flushed with his joint
of mutton and half-pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scouring under
the words `` foolish, twaddling,'' &c., and adding to them his own remark
of `` quite true'' Well, he is a lofty ma of genius, and admires the great
mud heroic in life and novels; and so had better take warning and go
elsewhere.
Well, then. The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, and bonnet-
boxes of Miss Sedley having been arranged by Mr. About in the carriage,
together with a very small and weather-beaten old cow's-skin trunk
with Miss Sharp's card neatly piled upon it, which was delivered by
name with a grin, and picked by the coachman with n corresponding
sneer-the hour for parting come; and the grief of that moment was
considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton
addressed to her pupil. Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to
philosophise, or that it named her in any way with a calmness, the result
of argument; but it was intolerably dull, popous, and tedious; and
having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss Sedley
did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions of private
grief. A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawing-
room, as on the solemn occasions of the visit of parents, and these fresh-
meets being partakes of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to depart.
 You 'll go in and say good by to Miss Pinkerton, Beck '' said Miss
Emma to a young lady of whom nobody took any notice, and who was
coming down stairs with her own handboxs.
 I suppose I must,'' said Miss Sharp calmly, and much to the wonder
of Miss Jemima; and the latter having knocked at the door, and receiving
permission to come in, Miss Sharp advanced in a very uneoncerned man-
her, and said in French, and with a perfect accent, ``Mademoiselle, je veins
vous faire me adieux.''
 Miss Pinkerton did not understand French; she only lireetel those
who did: but biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and Roman-
used head, (on the to of which figured a large and solemn turban,) she
said, `` Miss Sharp, I wish to a good morning.'' As the llammersmitl
Semiramis spoke, she waved one hand both by way of adieu, and to give
Miss Sharp an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the land which
was left out for that purpose.
Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigil smile and now,
and quite declined to accept the proffered honour; on which Semirmis
tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever. In fact, it was a little
battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter was worsted.
Heaven bless you, my child,'' said she, embracing Amelia, and scowling
the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp. ` Come away, Beck,''
said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great alarm, and the
drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.
Then came the struggle and parting below. Words refuse to tell it.
All the servants were there in the hall-all the dear friends-all the young
ladies-the dancing-master who had just arrived; and there was such a
shuffling, and hugging, and kissing, and crying, with the hysterical yes

Miss Sedley was almost as flurried at the act of defiance as Miss Jemima
had been; for, consider, it was but one minute that she had left school,
and the impressions of six years are not got over in that space of time.
Nay, with some persons those awes and terrors of youth last for ever and

to me one morning at breakfast, will n very fitted countenance,  I

had been at thirteen. If the Doctor, with a large birch, had appeared
bodily to him, even at the age of threescore and eight, and had said in
awful voice, ` Boy, take down your panes Well, well, Miss
Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination.

 Why, do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back

 No : but--''

I may never set eyes on it again. I wish it were in the bottom of the
Thames, I do; and if Miss Pinkerton were there, I wouldn 't pick her out,
that I wouldn't. O how I should like to see her floating in the water

e Why, will the black footman tell tales2'' cried Miss Rebeeca, laughing.
He may go back and tell Miss Pinkerton that I hate her with all my
soul ; and I wish he would; and I wish I had a means of proving it too.

sick of my mother-tongue. But that talking French to Miss linkerton
was capital fun, wasn't it She doesn't know a word of French, and was
too proud to confess it. I believe it was that which made her part with
me; and so thank Heaven for French. is la France 1 ice l'lwpereur l
is BonaparteI''
O Rebecca, Green, for shame'' cried Miss See ; for this was
the greatest blasphemy Rebccca had as yet uttered; and in those days, in
England, to say ``Long live Bonaparte I'' was as much as to say ``Long
live Lucifer1''  HOw can you-how dare you have such wicked,
revengeful thoughts''
` Revenge may be wicked, but it 's natural,'' answered Miss became.
 I 'm no angel.'' And, to say the truth, she certainly was not.
For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which
took place as the coach rolled long lazily by the river side) that though
Miss Rebeeca Sharp has twice had occasion to thank Heaven, it has been,
in the first place, for bidding her of some person whom she hated, and
secondly, for enabling her to bring her enemies to some sort of perplexity
or confusion ; neither of which are very amiable motives for religious
gratitude, or such as would be put forward by persons of a kind and
place disposition. Miss Rebeccen was not, then, in the least kind or
parable. All the world used her ill, said this young misanthropist (or
nisogynuist, for of the world of men she can be pronounced as yet to have
had but little experience), and we may be pretty certain that the persons
of either sex whom all the world treats ill, deserve entirely the treatment
they get. The world is a looking-glass, and gives bulk to every mun the
reflection of his own face. fRom at it, and it will in turn look sourly
pon you: laugh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion ; and
so let all young persons take their choice. This is certain, that if the
world neglected Miss Sharp, she never was known to have done a good
action in behalf of anybody; nor can it be expected that twenty-four
young ladies should all be as amiable as the heroine of this work, Miss Seller
(what we have selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured
of all, otherwise what on earth was to have prevented us from putting up
Miss Swartz, or Miss Crump, or Miss Hoping, as heroine in her place?)
it could not be expected that every one should be of the humble and gentle
temper of Miss Amelia Sedley; should take every opportunity to vanish
lehecca's hard-heartedness and ill-humour; and, by a thousand kind world
and offices, overcome, for once at least, her hostility to her kind.
Miss Sharp's father was an artist, and in that quality had given lessons
of drawing at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man; a pleasant
companion; a careless student; with a great propensity for running into
left, and a partiality for the tavern. When he was drunk, he used to
eat his wife and daughter; and the next morning, with a headache, he
used to rid at the world For its neglect of his genius, and abuse, with a
good deal of cleverness, and sometimes with perfect reason, the fools, his

himself, and as he owed money for a mile round Soho, where he lived, he

thought to better his circumstances by marrying a young woman of the
French nation, who was by profession an opera-girl. The humble calling
of her female parent, Miss Sharp never alluded to, but used to state house-
quietly that the Entreaties were a noble family of Balcony, and took
great pride in her descent from them. And curious it is, that as she
advanced in life this young lady's ancestors increased in rank and
splendour.
Rebecca's mother had had some education somewhere, and her daughter
spoke French with purity and a Parisian accent. It was in those days
rather a rare accomplishment, and led to her engagement with the orthodox
Miss Pinkertou. For her mother being dead, her father, finding him-
self not likely to recover, after his third attack of delirium tremens, wrote
a manly and pathetic letter to Miss Pinkerton, recommending the orphan
child to her protection, and so descended to the grave, after two bailiffs
had quarrelled over his corpse. Rebecca was seventeen when she came to
Chiswick, and was bound over as an article pnpil; her duties being to
talk French, as we have seen, and her privileges to live cost free, and,
with a few guineas a year, to gather scraps of knowledge from the professors
who attended the school.
She was small and slight in person; pale, sandy-hired, and with eyes
habitually cast down: when they looked up they were very large, odd, and
attractive; so attractive, that the Reverend Mr. Crisp, fresh from Oxford,
and curate to the Vicar of Chiswick, the Reverend M. Flowerdew, fell in
love with Miss Sharp; being shot dead by a glance of her eyes which was
fired all the way across Chiswiek Church from the school-pew to the
reading-desk. This infatnated young man used sometimes to take tes
with MIss Pinkerton, to whom he had been presented by his mamma, and
actually proposed something like marriage in an intereepted note, which
the one-eyed applewoman was charged to deliver. Mrs. Crisp was sum-
moved from Button, and abruptly carried off her darling boy; but the
idea, even, of such an eagle in the Chiswick dovecot caused a great flutter
in the breast of Miss Pinkerton, who would have sent away Miss Sharp, but
that she was bound to her under a forfeit, and who never could thoroughly
believe the young lady's protestations that she had never exchanged a single
word with Mr, Crisp, except under her own eyes on the two occasions
when she had met him at tea.
By the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the establishment,
Rebecca Sharp looked like a child. But she had the dismal precocity of
poverty. Many a dun had she talked to, and turned away from her father's
door; many a tradesman had she coaxed and wheedled into good-humour,
and into the granting of one meal more. She sat commonly with her
father, who was very proud of her wit, and heard the talk of many of his
wild companions-often but ill suited for a girl to hear. But she never
had been a girl, she said; she had been a woman since she was eight years
old. O why did Miss Pinkerton let such a dangerous bird into her cage
The fact is, the old lady thought Rebecca to be the deepest creature in
the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought her to
Chiswick, used Rebeccu to perform the part of the intense. She thought
her a modest and innocent little child; and only a year before the arrange-

ment by which Rebecca had been admitted into her house, and when Rebeccn
was sixteen years old, Miss Pinkerton majestically, and with little speech,
made her a present of a doll-which was, by the way, the confiscated pro-
perry of its Swindle, discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school-
hours. How the father and daughter laughed as they trudged home
together after the evening party, (it was on the occasion of the speeches,
when all the professors were invited,)and how Miss Pinkerton would have

to ask Rebeeea if Miss Pinkerton was at home: she was well known to
the, poor soul as Mr. Lawrenee or President Was. Once she had the
honour to pass a few days at Chiswick; after which she brought back
Jemima, and erected another doll as Miss Empty ; for though that honest
creature had made and given her jelly and cake enough for three children,

he catastrophe come, and she was brought to the Wall as to her home.
The rigid formaulity of the place suffocated her: the prayers and the meals,
the lessons and the walks, which were arranged with a conventunl regu-
larity, oppressed her almost beyond endurance: and she looked back to
the freedom and the beggary of the old studio in Soho with so much
regret, that everybody, herself included, fancied she was consumed with
grief for her father. She had a little room in the garret, where the maids
heard her walking and sobbing at night; but it was with rage, and not
with grief. She had not been much of a dissembler, until now her lonely-
ness taught her to feign. She had never mingled in the society of women:
her father, reprobate as he was, was a man of talent ; his conversation
was a thousand times more agreeable to her than the talk of such of her
own sex as she now encountered. The pompous vanity of the old school-
mistress, the foolish good-humour of her sister, the silly chat and scandal
of the elder girls, and the frigil correctness of the goverucsses equally
annoyed her; and she had no soft maternal heart, this unlucky girl, other-
wise the prattle and talk of the younger children, with whose care she was
chiefly intrusted, might have soothed and interested her; but she lived
among them two years, and not one was sorry that she went away. he
gentle tender-hearted Amelin Sedley was the only person to whom she could
uttach herself in the least ; and who could help attaching herself to Amelia?
The happiness-the superior advantages of the young women round
about her, grave lebeccu inexpressible pangs of envy.  What airs that
girl gives herself, because she is in Earl's grandlaughter,'' she said of one.
How they cringe and bow to that People, because of her hundred
thousand pounds I am a thousand times cleverer and more charming
than that creature, for all her wealth. I am as well bred as the Earl's
granddaughter, for all her fine pedigree; and yet every one passes me by
here. And yet, when I was at my father's, did not the men give up their
gaiety balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me?'' She
determined at any rate to get free from the prison in which she found
herself, and now began to act for herself, and for the first time to make
connected plans for the future.
She took advantage, therefore, of the means of study the place offered
her; and as she was already a musician and a good linguist, she speedily
went through the little course of study which was considered necessary for
ladies in those days. PIer music she practised incessantly, and one day,
when the girls were out, and she had remained at home, she was over-
heard to play a piece so well, that Minerva thought wisely, she could
spare herself the expense of a master for the junior, and intimated to
Miss Sharp that she was to instruct them in music for the future.
The girl refuse; and for the first time, and to the astonishment of the
majestic mistress of the school. `I am here to speak French with the
children,'' Rebeccn said abruptly, ``not to teach them music, and save
money for you. Give no money, and I will teach them.''
Minerva was obliged to yield, and, of course, disliked her from that day.
 For five-and-thirty years,'' she said, and with great justice, I never

ave seen the individual who has dared in my own house to question my
authority. I have nourished a viper in my bosom.''
 A viper-a fiddlestick,'' said Miss Sharp to the old lily, almost find-
rug with astonishment. ``You took me because I was useful. There is no
question of gratitude between us. I hate this place, and want to leave it,
I will do nothing here, but what I am obliged to do.''
It was in vain that the old lady asked her if she is aware she was
speaking to Miss Pinkerton lebeccas laughed in her face, with a horrid
sarcastic demoniacal laughter, that almost sent the schoolmistress into fits.
Give me a sum of money,'' said the girl, ``and get rid of me-or, if you
like better, get me a good place as governess in a nobleman's family-you
can do so if you please.'' And in their further disputes she always
returned to this point, ` Get me a situation-we hate each other, and I
am ready to go.''
Worthy Miss Pinkerton, although she had a Roman nose and a turbnn,
and was as tall as a grenadier, and had been up to this time an irresistible
princess, had no will or strength like that of her little apprentice, and in
vain did battle against her, and tried to overawed her. Attempting once
to sold her in public, Rebecca hit upon the before-mentioned plan of
answering her in French, which quite routed the old woman. In order to
maintain authority in her school, it became necessary to remove this rebel,
this monster, this serpent, this firebrand; and hearing about this time
that Sir Pitt Crawled's fully was in want of a governess, she actually
recommenlded Miss Sharp for the situation, firebrand and serpent as she
was. ''I cannot, certainly,'' she said, ''find fault with Miss Ship's con-
dust, except to myself; and must allow that her talents and come-
punishment are of a high order. As for and the head goes, at least, she
does credit to the educutional system pursued at y establishment.''
And so the schoolmistress rcconciled the recommendation to her con-
science, and the adventures were channelled, and the apprenticc was free.
The battle here described in a few lines, of course, lasted for some months.
And as MIss Seller, being now seventeen years of age, was about to leave
school, and had a friendship for Miss Sharp, (`` 'tis the only point in
Amelia's behaviour,'' said Minerva, '`which has not been satisfactory to
her mistress,'') Miss Sharp was invited by her friend to pass a week with
her at home, before she entered upon her duties as governess in a private
Family.
Thus the world began for these two young ladies. For Amelia it was
quite a new, fresh, brilliant world, with all the bloom upon it. It was not
quite a new one for Rcbececa-(indeed, if the truth must be told with
respect to the Crisp affair, the tart-woman hinted to somebody who took
in affiduvit of the fact to somebody else, that there was a great deal more
than was made public regarding Mr. Crisp un Miss Sharp, and that his
letter was in answer to another letter). But who can tell you the girl truth
of the matter At all events, if became was not beginning the world,
she was beginning it over again.
By the time the young ladies reached Kensington turnpike, Amelin had
not forgotten her companions, but had dried her tears, and had blushes
very much and been delighted at a young officer of the Life Guards, who

speed her as he was riding by, and said, ``A dem fine gl, gall'' and
before the carriage arrived in Trusses Square, a great deal of conversation
had taken place about the drawing-room, and whether or not young ladies
wore powder as well as hoops when presented, and whether she was to
have that honour: to the Lord Mayor's ball she knew she was to go.
And when at length home was reached, Miss Amelia Sedley skipped out on
About's arm, as happy and as handsome a girl as any in the whole big city
of London. Both he and coachman agreed on this point, and so did her
father and mother, and so did every one of the servants in the house, as
they stood sobbing, and curtseying, and smiling, in the hall, to welcome
their young mistress.
You may be sure that she showed Rebecca her every room of the
house, and everything in every one of her drawers ; and her books, and
her piano, and her dresses, and all her necklaces, branches, laces, and
gimcracks. She insisted upon Rebecca accepting the white cornland and
the turquoise rings, and a sweet spirited muslin, which was too small for
her now, though it would fit her friend to a ninety; and she determined
in her heart to ask her mother's permission to present her white Cashmerc
shawl to her friend. Could she not spare it? and had not her brother
Joseph just brought her two from India?
When Rebecca saw the two magnificent Cashmere shawls which Joseph
Sedley had brought,home to his sister, she said, with perfect truth, ``that
it must be delightful to have a brother,'' and easily got the pity of the
tender-hearted Amelia, for being alone in the world, an orphan without
friends or kindred.
:Not alone,'' said Amelia, ``' you know, Rebecca, I shall always be your
friend, and love you as a sister-indeed I will.''
`'Ah, but to have parents, as you have-kind, rich, affectionate parents,
who give you everything you ask for; and their love, which is more pre-
pious than all1 My poor papa could give me nothing, and I had but two

Perhaps she had mentioned the fact already to kebceca, but that young

lady did not appear to have remembered it; indeed, vowed and protested
that she expected to see a number of Anelia's nephew and niece. She
was quite disappointed that Mr. Sedley was not married; she was sure
Amelia had said he was, and she dozed so on little children.
I think you must have had enough of them at Chiswick,'' sail Amelia,
rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friend's part; and indeed
in later days Miss Sharp would never have committed herself so far as to
advance opinions, the untruth of which would have been so easily detected.
But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet, unused to the art
of deceiving, poor innocent creature and making her own experience in
her own person. The meaning of the above series of berries, as trains-
late in the heart of this ingenious young woman, was simply this:-`If
Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why should I not marry him

determined within herself to make this laudnble attempt. She redonbled
her caresses to Amelia; she kissed the white cornelian necklace as she put
it on; and owed she would never, never port with it. When the dinner-
bell rang she went down stairs with her arm round her friend's waist, as
is the habit of young ladies. She was so agitated at the drawing-room
door, that she could hardly find courage to enter. ` Feel my heart, how
it beats, dear1'' did she to her friend.
 No, it doesn't,'' said Amelia. `' Come i, don't be frightened. Papa
wont do you any harm.,''

It's only your sister, Joseph,'' said Amelia, laughing and shaking the
two fingers which he held out. :I 've come hoe fr good you know;
and this is my friend, Miss Sharp, whom you have heard me mention,.''
No, need, upon my word,'' said the head under the neckcloth, shake-
ing very much,-`` that is, yes,-what nbominably cold weather, Miss;''-
and wherewith he fell to poking the fire with all his might, although it was
in the middle of June.
 He's very handsome,'' whispered Rebecca to Amelia, rather loud.
 Do you think so:'' said the latter,  I 'i tell him.''
Darling l not for worlds,'' sail Miss Sharp, starting back us timid
as a fun. She had previously made a respectful virgin-like course to
the gentleman, and her modest eyes gazed so perseveringly on the carpet
that it was a wonder how she should have found an opportunity to see him.
 Thank you for the beautiful shawls, brother,'' said Amelia to the fire-
poker. ``Are they not beautiful, Reverie ?''
O heavenly'' said Miss Sharp, and her eyes went from the carpet
straight to the chandelier.
oseph still continued a huge flattering at the poker and tongs, puffing
and blowing the while, and turning as red as his yellow face would allow
him. I can't mkc you such handsome presents, Joseph,'' continued his
sister, ``but while I was at school, I have cbroidered for you a very
beautiful pair of braces,''
 Good And l Amelia,'' eriel the brother, in serious alarm, `` what do
you mean?'' and plunging with all his might at the bell-rope, that article
of furniture came away in his hand, and increased the honest fellow's con-
fusion.  For heaven's sake she if my buggy 's at the door. I can't wait.

But in this dress it 's impossible.''
 Look at him, isn't he lnlsome enough to dine anywhere, Miss
Sharp?''
On which, of course, Miss Sharp looked at her friend, and they both set
off in a fit of laughter, highly agreeable to the old gentleman.
 Did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at Miss Pinkerton's''
continued he, following up his advantage.
 Gracious heavens Father,'' cried Joseph.
e There now, I have hurt his feelings. Mrs. Seller, y dear, I have
hurt your son's feelings. I have allude to his buckskins. Ask Miss
Sharp if I haven't Come, Joseph, be friends with Miss Sharp, and let

 There's a pillar, Joseph, just as you like it, and Papa has brought

do her very best to secure the husband, who was even more necessary for
her than for her friend. She had a vivid imagination; she had, besides,
read the ``Arabian Nights'' and `` Gautier's Geography,'' and it is a fact,
that while she was dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia
whether her brother was very rich, she had built for herself a most man-
friend castle in the air, of which she was mistress, with a husband some-
where in the background (she had not seen him as yet, and his figure
would not therefore be very distinct); she had arrayed herself in an infinity
of shawls, turbans, and diamond necklaces, and had mounted upon an
elephant to the sound of the march in Bluebeard, in order to pay a visit of
ceremony to the Grand Old. Charming Alnaschar visions l it is the

Joseph Sedley was twelve years older than his sister Mmelia. He was in
the Most India Company's Civil service, and his name appeared, at the
period of which we write, in the Being division of the East India Register,
as collection of Boggley Wholly, an honourable and lucrative post, as every-
body knows: in order to know to what higher posts Joseph rose in the
service, the render is referred to the same periodical.
Boggley Wholly is situated in a fine, lonely, marshy, ugly district,
famous for suipe-shooting, and where not unfrequently you may flush a
tiger. Ramgunge, where there is a magistrate, is only forty miles off,
and there is a canary station about thirty miles farther; so Joseph wrote
home to his parents, when he took possession of his colleetorship. lIe
had lived for about eight years of his life, quite alone, at this charm-
rug place, scarcely seeing a Christian face, except twice a year, when the
attachment arrived to carry off the avenues which he had collected, to
Calcutta.
Luckily, at this time he caught a liver complaint, for the cure of which
he returned to Europe, and which was the source of great comfort
and amusement to him in his native country. He did not lie with his
family while in London, but had lodgings of his own, like a gay young
bachelor. Before he went to India he was too young to partake of the
delightful pleasures of a man about town, and plunged into them on his
return, with considerable assiduity. He drove his horses in the l'ark;
he dined nt the fashionable taverns, (for the Oriental Club was not as
yet invented); he frequented the theatres, as the more was in those days,
or made his appearance at the opera, laboriously attired in tights and a
checked hat.
On returning to India, and ever after, he used to talk of the pleasure of
this period of his existence with great enthusiasm, and give you to under-
stand that he and lBrummel were the leading backs of the day. But he
was as lonely here as in his jungle at Boggley Wholly. lIe scarcely due
n single soul in the netropolis: and were it not for his doctor, and the
society of his blue-pill, and his liver complaint, he must have died of lone-
lines. He was lazy, peevish, and a bon-vioant;: the appearance of a lady
frightened him beyond measure; hence it was but seldom that he joined
the paternal circle in Trusses Square, where there was plenty of gaiety, and

where the jokes of his good-nature old father frightened his auor-proper.
His bulk caused Joseph much anxious thought und alarm; now and then
he would make a desperate attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat;
but his indolence and love of good living speedily got the better of these
endeavours at reform, and he found himself again at his three meals a day.
lIe never was well dressed; but he took the hugest pains to adorn his
big person, and passed many hours daily in tlt occupation. His valct
made a fortune out of his wardrobe : his toilet-table was covered with as
any pomatums and csscnces as ever were employed by an old beauty:
he had tried, in order to give himself n wish, very girth, stay, and waist-
band then invented. Like most fat men, he would have his clothes made
too tight, and took care they should be of the most brilliant colours
and youthful cut. When dressed at length, in the afternoon, he would
issue forth to take a drive with nobody in the lark; and then would come
back in order to dress again and go and dine with nobody at the Piano
Coffee-House. lIe was as vain as a girl; and perhaps his extreme shyness
was one of the results of his extreme vanity. If Miss Recent can get the
better of him, and at her first entrance into life, she is a young person of
no ordinary cleverness.
The first move showed considerable skill. When she called Coldly n
very handsome man, she knew that Amelia would tell her mother, who
would probably tell Joseph, or who, at any rate, would be please by thlc
compliment paid to her son. All mothers are. If you had told Sicornxs
that her son Caliban was as handsome as Apollo, she would have been
pleased, witch as she was. Perhaps, too, Joseph Sedley would overhear
the compliment-Rebeccea spoke loud enough-and he did her, and (think-
ing in his heart that he was a very fine man,) the praise thrilled through
every fibre of his big body, and made it mingle with pleasure. Then, how-
ever, came a recoil. `` Is the girl making fun of me'' he thought, and
straightway he bounced towards the hell, anne was for retreating, as we
have seen, when his father's jokes and his mother's entrenties caused him
to pause and stay where he was. In conducted the young lady down to
dinner in a dubious and agitated frame of ind. :Does she really think
I am handsome'' thought he, `` or is she only making game of me'' WE
have talked of Joseph Since being as vain as a girl. Heaven help us the
girls have only to turn the tables, and say of one of their own sex, ' She is
as vain as a man,'' s they will have perfect reason. The bearded can-
turns are quite as eager for praise, quite as fiuikin over their toilettes, quite
as proud of their personal advantages, quite as conscious of their powers of
fascination, as any couette in the world.
Down stirs, then, they went, Joseph very red and blushing, Hebeeca
very modest, and holding her green eyes downwards. She was dressed
in white, with bare shoulders as white as snow-the picture of youth,
unprotected innocence, and humble virgin simplicity. ` I must be very
quiet,'' thought Breeze, `` and very much interested about India.''
Now we have heard how Mrs. Sedley had prepared n fine carry for her
son, just as he liked it, and in the course of dinner a portion of this dish
was offered to Rebecea. : What is it?'' sail she, turning an appealing
look to Mr. Joseph.

gentleman; but when the ladies had retired after diner, the wily all
fellow said to his son, ``1Have n care, Joe; that girl is setting her cap at

wards married to INdeed, the surgeon, who made a dead sit at me in the

inquire about the river and the blue-pill.
Being an invalid, Joseph Sedley contented himself with a bottle of claret
besides his Mndeira at dinner, and he managed a couple of plates full of
strawberries and cream, and twenty-four little rout cakes, that were lying
neglected in a plate near him, and certainly (for novelists have the privilege
of knowing everything), he thought n great deal about the girl up stairs.

windows of the drawing-room, while Rebecca was singing at the piano.

days; during which he did not visit
the house, nor during that period did
Miss Rebeccn ever mention his name.
She was all respectful gratitude to
Mrs. Sedley; delighted beyond me-
sure it the bazaar; and in a whirl of
wonder at the theatre, whither the
good-natured lady took her. One
day, Amclia had a head-ache, and
could not go upon some party of
pleasure to which the two young
people were invited: nothing could
induce her friend to go without her.
 When you who have shown the
poor orphan what happiness and love are for the first time in her life-
quit you' never.'' and the green eyes looked up to Live and filled
with tears ; and Mrs. Else could not but own that her daughter's friend
had a charming kind heart of her own.
As for Mr. Sedley's jokes, Rebhecea lulled at them with a cordialiy
und perseerance which not a little pleased and softened that good-natured
gentleman. Nor was it with the chiefs of the family alone that Miss
Sharp found favour. She interested Mrs. Blenkinsop by cviucing the
deepest sympathy in the raspberry-jam preserving, which operation was
then going on in the HOusekeeper's room ; she persisted in calling Same
 Sir,'' and ` Mr. Snow,'' to the delight of that attendant; and she
apologised to the lady's maid for giving her trouble in venturing to ring
the bell, with such sweetness and humility, that the Servants' Hall was
almost as charmed with her as the Drawing Room.
Once, in looking over some drawings which Amelin and sent from
school, kebecca suddenly came upon one which caused her to burst into
tears and leave the room. It was on the day when Joe Coldly made his
second appearance.
Amelia hastened after her friend to know the cause of this display of
feeling, and the good-nature girl came back without her companion,
rather affected too.  You know, her father was our drawing-master.

fully.  How kind you all are to me. All,'' she added, with a laugh,
``except you, Mr. Joseph.''

 Yes; how could you be so cruel us to make me eat that horrid pen-
per-dish at dinner, the first day I ever saw you you are not so good to
me as dear Amelia,''
He doesn't know you so well,'' merely Amelia.

 Perhaps there was not enough citron juice in it;-no, there was not.''
 And the chills P 
I3y Jove, how they made you cry out.'' said Joe, caught by the rid-
rule of the circumstance, and exploring in a fit of laughter which ended
quite suddenly, as usual.
I shall take care how I let you choose for me another time,'' said
Rebececa, as they went down again to dinner. `I didn't think men were
fond of putting poor harmless girls to pain.''
BY Gad, Miss Rebecca, l1 wouldn't hurt you for the world.''
 No,'' said she, `` I owe you wouldn't;'' and then she gave him over
so gentle a pressure with her little hand, and drew it back quite frightened,
and looked first for one instant in his face, and then down at the carpet-
rods; and I am not prepared to say that Joe's heart did not thump at
this little involuntary, timid, gentle motion of regard on the part of the
simple girl.
It was an advance, and as such, perhaps, some ladies of indisputable
correctness and gentility will condemn the action as immodest; but, you
see, poor dear became had all this work to do for herself, If a person
is too poor to keep a servant, though ever so elegant, he must sweep his own
rooms : if a dear girl has no dear Mamma to settle matters with the young
man, she must do it for herself. And oh, what a mercy it is that these
women do not exercise their powers oftener1 We can't resist them, if
they do. Let them slow ever so little inclination, and men go down on

that the darlings are like the beasts of the field, and don't know their own

`Egad :'' thought Joseph, entering the dining-room, '`I exactly begin
to feel as I did at Medium with Miss Butler.'' Many sweet little apples,
half tender, all joeular, did Miss Sharp make to him about the dishes at
dinner; for by this time she was on a footing of considerable familiarity
with the family, and as for the girls, they loved each other like sisters.
young unmarried girls always do, if they are in a house together for ten
days.
As if bent upon dancing Rebecea's plans in every way-what must
Amelia do, but remind her brother of a promise made last sister holidays
-When I was a girl at school,'' said she, laughing--a promise that he,
Joseph, would take her to Vauxhall.  Now,'' he said, `` the Rebecca
is with us, will be the very time.''
O, delightful 1'' said Rebecca, going to clap her hands; but she re-
collected herself, and paused, like a modest creature, as she was.
 To-night is not the night,'' said Joe.
 WEll, to-morrow,''

' and that a woman of your years and size is to catch cold, in such an
abominable damp place ?''
 The children must have some one with them,'' eriel MIre. Sedley.
``Let Joe go,'' sir his father, laughing.  He's is enough.'' A1
which speech even Mr. About at the sideboard burst out laughing, and
good fat Joe felt inclined to become a parricide almost.

lion, the old joker stopped his laughter, and sail, holding out his hand to
his son, ` It's all fair on the Stock-Exchange, Joy,-and, About, never
mind the elephant, but give me and Mr. Job a glass of Champague. Money
himself hasn't got such in his cellar, my boy1''
A goblet of Champagne restored Joseph's equanimity, and before the
bottle was emptied, of which as an invalid he took two-third, he had
green to take the young ladies to Vauxhall.
The girls must have a gentleman apieee,'' said the old gentleman.
'`Joy will be sure to leave EArly in the crowd, he will be so taken up with
Miss Sharp here. Send to 86, and ask George Borne if he'll come.'
At this, I don't know in the lest for wet reason, Mrs. Surely looked
at her husband and laughed. Mr. Sedley's eyes twinkled in a manner
indescribably anguish, and he looked at Amelia,; and Amelia hanging
down her head, blushed as only young ladies of seventeen know how to
lush, and as Miss became Sharp never blushed in her life-at least not

since she was right years old, and when she was caught stealing jam out
of' a cupboard by her godmother. `` Amelia had better write a note,'' said
her father; `` and let George Borne see what n beautiful hand-writing

Tent was years ago,'' said Ameliu.
It seems like yesterday, don't it, John?'' soil Mrs. Sedley to her his-
hand; and that night in a conversation which took place in a front room
in the second-floor, in a sort of tent, hung round with chintz of a rich and
fantastic India pattern, and double' with cnlico of a tender rose-colour; in
the interior of which species of mnrquee was n feather-bed, on which were
two pillows, on which were two round red faces, one in a laced nightcap, and
one in n time cotton one, ending in a tassel :-in a curtain lecture, I
say, MIss. Sedley took her husband to task for his cruel conduct to poor
Joy.
It was quite wicked of you, Mr. Sedley,'' said she, ``to torment tlc
poor boy so.''
My dear,'' said the cotton-tasscel in defence of his conduct, `' Joy is
a great deal answer than you ever were in your life, and that 's saying a
good deal. Though, some thirty years ago, in the year seventeen hundred
and eighty-what was it?-perhaps you had a right to be vain.-I don't
say no. But I 've no patience with Joy nnl his dnndifiel modesty. It is
out-Josephing Joseph, my dear, and all the while the boy is only thinking
of himself, and what a fine fellow he is. I doubt, Ma'am, we shall have
some trouble with him yet. Here is Emmy's little friend making love to
him as hard as she can; that's quite clear ; and if she does not teach
him some other will. That man is destined to be a prey to woman, s I
am to go on 'Change every day. It's n mercy he did not bring us over

who fishes for him, hooks him,''

with great energy.
e Why not she as well as another, Mrs. ScdleyP The girl's a white
face at any rate. IT don't care who marries him. Let Joe please
himself.''
And presently the voices of the two speakers were hushed, or were
replaced by the gentle but unromantic music of the nose; and save when
the church bells tolled the hour and the watchman called it, all was silent
at the house of John Coldly, Squire, of swell Square, and the Stock
Exchange.
When morning came, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley no longer thought
of executing her threats with regard to Miss Sharp; for though nothing
is more keen, nor more common, nor more justifiable, than maternal
jealousy, yet she could not bring herself to suppose that the little, humble,
grateful, gentle governess, would dare to look up to such a magnificent
personage as the Collect of Boggley Wholly. The petition, too, for an
extension of the young lady's leave of absence had already been despatched,
and it would be difficult to find a pretext for abruptly dismissing her.

And as if all things considered in favour of the gentle Rebecca, the very
elements (although she was not inclined at first to acknowledge their
notion in her behalf) interposed to aid her. For on the evening appointed
for the auxhall party, George Borne having come to dinner, and the
elders of the house having departed, according to invitation, to dine with
Alderan Balls, at Higlbury Barn, there came on such a thunder-storm
as only happens on Vauxhall nights, and as obliged the young people,
perforcee, to remain at home. Mr. Borne did not seem in the lest dis-
appointed at this occurrence. Ho and Joseph Sedley drank a fitting
quantity of port-wine, tete-a-trite, in the dining-room,-during the drinking
of which Sedley told a number of is best Indian stories ; for he was ex-
extremely talkative in man's society ;-and afterwards Miss Amelia Sedley
did the honours of the drawing-room; and these four young persons
passed such a comfortable evening together, that they declared they were
rather glad of the thunder-storm than otherwise, which had caused them
to put off their visit to Vauxhall.
Osborue was Sedley's gods, and had been one of the family any time
these three-and-twenty years. At six weeks old, he had received from
John Sedley a present of a silver cup; at six months old, a coral with
gold whistle and bells; from his youth, upwards, he was ``tired'' regu-
early by the old gentleman at Christmas: and on going back to school,
he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by Joseph edley, when the
latter was a big, staggering, hobbadyhoy, and George an impudent church
of ten years old. In a word, George was as familiar with the family is
such daily acts of kindness and intercourse could make him.
Do you remember, Coldly, what a fury you were in, when I cut off
the tassels of your Russian boots, and how Miss-hem l-how Aielia
rescued me from a beating, by falling down on her knees and crying out
to her brother Joy, not to bent little George P''
Joy remembered this remarkable circumstance perfectly well, but vowed
that he had totally forgotten it.
 Well, do you remember coming own in a gig to Dr. Swishtail's, to
see me, before you went to Iudia, and giving me half a guinea and a it
on the head I always had an idea that you were at least seven feet
high, and was quite astonished at your return from India to find you no
taller than myself.''
lOw good of Mr. Sedley to go to your school nnl give you the
money 1'' exclaimed Rebecca, in accents of extreme delight,
 es, and after I had cut the tassels of his boots too. Boys never
forget the tips at school, nor the givers.''
I delight in Russian boots,'' said Rebecca. Joy Seller, who admired
his own legs prodigiously, and always word his ornnamental chaussure, was
extremely pleased at this remark, though he drew his legs under his chair
as it was made.

you must make a grand historical picture of the scene of the roots. Sedley

speling-look.''
'I shan't have time to do it here,'' said lebecca.  I 'll do it when-
when I am gone.'' And she dropped her voice, and looked so sad and
piteous, that everybody felt how cruel her lot was, and how sorry they
would be to part with her.
O that you could stay longer, car Rebeeca,'' said Mmelia.
 Why ?'' answered the other, still more sadly. `` That I may be only
the more upon-unwilling to lose you'' And she turned away her
heel. Amelia began to give way to that natural infirmity of tears which,
we have said, was one of the defects of this silly little thing. George
Borne looked at the two young women with na touched curiosity; and
Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest, as he
cast his eyes down towards his favourite Russian boots.
Let us have some music, Miss Sedley-Amelia,'' sail George, who
felt at that moment an extraordinary, almost irresistible impulse to seize
the above-mentioned young woman in his arms, and to kiss her in the free
of the company; and she looked at him for a moment, and if I should say
that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time, I should
perhaps be telling an untruth, for the fact is, that these two young people
had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose, and their banns
had, as it were, being read in their respective families any time these ten
years. They went off to the piano, which was situated, as piano usually
are, in the back drawing-room; and as it was rather lark, Miss Mmelia, in
the most unaffected way in the world, put her hand into Mr. Borne's,
who, of course, could see the way among the chairs and ottomans a great
deal better than she could. But this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley
teite-d-tete it Rebecea, at the drawing-room table, where the latter was
occupied in netting a green silk purse.
 There is no need to ask family secrets,'' said Miss Sharp.  Those
two have told theirs,''
As soon as he gets his company,'' said Joseph, ``I believe the affair is
settled. George Borne is as good a fellow as ever breathed.''
``And your sister te dearest creature in the world,'' said Rebeccn.
`Happy the man who wins her' With this, Miss Sharp due a great
sigh.
When two unmarriel persons get together, and talk upon such delicate
subjects as the present, a great deal of confidence and intimacy is presently
established between them. here is no need of giving a special report of
the conversation which now took place between Mr. Clock and the young
lady; for the conversation, as any be judged from the foregoing specimen,
was not especially witty or contents; it seldom is in private societies, or
anywhere except in very high-flown and ingenious novels. As there was
music in the next room, the talk was carried on, of course, in a low and
becoming tone, though, for the matter of that, the couple in the next apart-
ment would not have been disturbed had the talking been ever so loud, so
occupied were they with their own pursuits.
lost for the first time in his life, Mr. Seller found himself talking,
without the least timidity or hesitation, to n person of the other sex. MIss

Ielccca asked him a great number of questions about India, which gave
him an opportunity of arranging many interesting anecdotes about that
country and himself. HIe described the balls at Government House, and
the manner in which they kept themselves cool in the lot weather, with
punkahs, attics, and other contrivances; and he was very witty regarding
the number of Scotchen whom Lord Into, the Govcrnor-General,
patronised; and then he described a tiger hunt ; and the manner in which
the mouth of his cleplant had been pulled off his seat by one of the
infuriated animals. INto delighted Miss ebeccn was at the Government
balls, and how she laughed at the stories of the sCotch aides-de-camp, and
called Mr. Sedley a sad wicked satiricnl creature; and how frightened she
was at the story of the elcphant. For your mother's sake, dear Mr.
Sedley,'' she said, ` for the sake of all your friends, promise never to go on
one of those horrid expeditions,''
 Pooh, pool, Miss Sharp,'' said he, pulling up his shirt-collars; `` the
danger makes the sport only the pleasanter.'' He had never been but one
at a tiger-hunt, when the accident in question occurred, and when he was
half killed-not by the tiger, but by the friglt. And as he talked on, le
grew quite boy, and actually had the audacity to ask Miss Rebecca for
whom she was knitting the green silk purse? He was quite surprised and
delighted at his own graceful familiar manner.
For any one who wants a purse,'' replied Miss Rebeccn, looking at
him in the most gentle winning way. Sedley was going to make one of
the most eloquent speeches possible, and had begun, `TO Miss Sharp,
how-'' when she song which was performed in the other room came to
an end, and caused him to hear his own voice so distinctly that he stopped,
blushed, and blew his nose in great agitation.
Did you ever hear anything like your brother's eloquence P'' whispered
Mr. Borne to Amelia. : Why, your friend has worked miracles.''
 The more the better,'' said Miss Hamlin; who, like almost all women
who are worth a pin, was a match-maker in her heart, and would have been
delighted that Joseph should carry back a wife to India. She had, too, in
the course of this few days' constant intercourse, warmed into a most
tender friendship for Rebecca, and discovered a million of virtues and
amiable qualities in her which she had not perceived when they were at
Chiswick together. or the affection of young ladies is of as rapid growth
as Jack's been-stalk, and reaches up to the sky in night. It is no blame
to them that after marriage this Sehxueuelt each der Liele subsides. It is
what sentientalists, who deal in eery big words, call a yearning after the
Ideal, and simply means that women are commonly not satisfied until they
have husbands and children on whom they may centre affections, which
are spent elsewhere, as it were, in small change.
Having expended her little store of songs, or having stayed long enough
in the back drawing-room, it now appeared proper to Miss Amelia to ask
her friend to sing. ` You would not have listened to me,'' she said to
Mr. Borne, (though she knew she was telling a fit,) ``had you heard

You shall her,'' side Amelia; me Joseph Sedley was actually polite
enough to carry the candles to the piano. Borne hinted that he should
like quite as well to sit in the dark; but Miss Sedley, laughing, declined
to bear him company any farther, and the two accordingly followed Mr.
Joseph. Rebeecas song far better than her friend, (though of course
Borne was free to keep his opinion,) and exerted herself to the utmost,
and, indeed, to the wonder of Amelia, who had never known her perform
so well. She sang a French song, which Joseph did not understand in the
last, and which George confessed he did not understand, and then a
number of those simple ballads which were the fashion forty years ago,
and in which British tears, our King, poor susan, blue-eyed Mary, and the
like, were the principal themes. They are not, it is said, very brilliant, is
a musical point of view, but contain numberless good-natured, simple
appeals to the affcetions, which people understood better than the milk-
and-water alarmed, spirit, and felicity of the eternal Donizettian music
with which we are favoured no-n-days.
Conversation of a sentimental sort, befitting the subject, was carried on
between the songs, to which Among, after he had brought the tea, the

upon what are called `mutual pain-

betrayed by his father, in goods not money; and he stood there-almost
at the bottom of the school-in lis scraggy corduroys and jacket, through
the seams of which his great big bones were bursting-as the representative
of so many pounds of ten, candles, sugar, mottlel-soup, plums, (of which a
very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the establishment), and
other commodities. A dreadful by it was for young Doing when one of
the youngsters of the school, having run into the the towupon a poaching
excursion for hardbake and polonies, spoilt the cart of Doing & Rude,

charging a cargo of the wares in which the firm dealt.
young Doing had no peace after that. he jokes were frightful, and
merciless against him. `` PIllow, Doing,'' on wag would say, ``here's
god news in the paper. Sugar is his', y boy.'' Another would set
a sum-'`If a proud of mutton-candles cost sevenpence-halfpenny, how
much must Doing cost?'' and a roar would follow fro all the circle of
young waves, usher and all, who rightly considered that the selling of goods
by retail is a shameful and infamous practice, meeting the contempt and
scorn of all real gentlemen.
``Your father's only a merchant, Borne,'' Doing said in private to
the little boy who had brought down the storm upon him. At which
the utter replied haughtily, ` My father's a gentleman, and keeps his
carriage;'' and Mr. William Doing retreated to an remote outhouse in
the play-ground, where he passed a half-holiday in the bitterest sadness
and o. Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of

bitter, bitter childish grief Who feels injustice; who shrinks before a
slight; who has as sense of wrong so acute, and so glowing a gratitude
for kindness, as a generous boy? and how many of those gentle souls do
you degrade, estrange, torture, for the sake of a little loose arithmetic, and
miserable dog-latin
Now, William Doing, from an incapacity to acquire the judgments of
the above language, as they are propounded in that wonderful book the
Eton Latin Grammar, was compelled to remain among the very last of
Doctor Swishtail's scholars, and was `taken down' continually by little
fellows with pink faces and pinafores when he marched up with the lower
form, a giant amongst them, with his downcast, stupefiedlook, his dogs-eared
primer, and his tight corduroys. lEigh and low, all made fun of him.
They sewed up those corduroys, tight as they were. They cut his bed-
strings. They upset buckets and benches, so that he might break his
ships over them, which he never failed to do. They sent him parcels,
which, when opened, were found to contain the paternal soap and candles.
There was no little fellow but had his jcer and joke at Doing; and he
bore everything quite patiently, and was entirely dumb and miserable.
Cuff, on the contrary, was the great chief and dandy of the Swishtail
Seminary. He smuggled wine in. He fought the town-boys. Ponies
used to come for him to ride home on Saturday. He had his top-boots
in his room, in which he used to hunt in the holidays. He had a gold
repeated : and took nuff like the Doctor. He had been to the Opera,
and knew the merits of the principal actors, preferring Mr. Keen to Mr.
kemble. He could knock you off forty Latin verses in an hour. He would
make French poetry. What else didn't he know, or couldn't he do They
said even the Doctor himself was afraid of him.
Cuff, the unquestioned king of the school, ruled over his subjects, and
bulliel them, with splendid superiority. This one blacked his shoes: that
toasted his bread, others would far out, and give him all at aricket
during whole summer afternoons. ` Figs' was the fellow whom he despised
most, and with whom, though always amusing him, and sneering at him,
he scarcely ever condescended to hold personal communication.
One day in private, the two young gentlemen had had a difference. Figs,
alone in the school-room, was blundering over a home latter; when Cuff,
entering, bade him go upon some message, of which parts were probably
the subject.
 I can't,'' says Doing; ``I want to finish my letter.''
 You can't 2'' says Mr, Cuff, laying hold of that document, (in which
many words were scratched out, many were mis-spelt, on which had been
spent I don't know how much thought, and labour, and tears; for the poor
fellow was writing to his mother, who was fond of him, although she was
a grower's wife, and lived in a back parlour in names-street), `` you can't2'
says Mr. Cut:  ` I should like to know why, pray Can't you write to
old MOther Figs to-morrow %''
Don't call names,'' Doing said, getting off the bench, very nervous.
Well, sir, will you go2'' crowed the cock of the school.
e Put down the letter,'' Being replied; ``no gentleman breadth letter.''
 Well, now will you go'' says the other.
A NOVEL WITHOUT 1 HERO.
No, I won't. Don't strike, or Ill last you,'' roars out Doing,
springing to s leaden instant, and looking so wicked, that Mr. Cut
paused, turned down his coat sleeves again, put his hands into his pockets,
and walked away with a sneer. But he never meddled personally with the
grower's boy after that: though we must do him the justice to say he always
spoke of Mr. Behind with contempt behind his back.
some time after this interview, it happened that Mr. Cuff, on a sun-
shiny afternoon, was in the neighbourhood of poor William Doing, who
was lying under a tree in the play-ground, spelling over a favourite copy
of the Arabian Nights which he had-apart from the rest of the school,

If people would but leave children to themselves; if teachers would
cease to bull them; if parents would not insist upon directing their
thoughts, and dominating their feelings-those feelings and thoughts
which are a mystery to all (for how much do you and I know of each

children alone a little more,-small harm would accrue, although a less
quantity of as in present might be acquired.
Well, William Doing had for once forgotten the world, and was away
with Sindbad the Sailor in the Valley of Diamonds, or with Prince What-
recalled and the Fairy Peribanou in that delightful cavern where the
Prince found her, and whither we should all like to make a tour; when
shrill cries, as of a little fellow weeping, woke up his pleasant reverie;
and, looking up, he saw Cuff before him, belahouring a little boy.
It was the lad who had reached upon him about the grower's cart; but
he bore little malice, not at least towards the young and small.  How
dare you, sir, break the bottle2'' says Cuff to the little church, swinging
a yellow cricket-stump over him.
The boy had been instructed to get over the play-ground wall (at n
selected spot where the broken-glass had been removed from the top, and
niches mate counvenient in the brick); to run a quarter of a mile; to purchase
n pint of rum-shut on credit; to brave all the Doctor's outlying spies,
and to chamber back into the play-ground again; during the performance
of which feat, his foot had slept, and the bottle was broken, and the shrub
had been spilt, and his pantaloons had been damaged, and he appeared
before his employer a perfectly guilty and trembling, though harmless,
wretch.
How dare you, sir, break it'' says Cuff; `' you blundering little thief.
You drank the shrub, and now you pretend to have broken the bottle.
1Hold out your hand, sir.''
Down came the stump with a great heavy thump on the chill's hand.
A one followed. Doing looked up. The Prince Peribanou had fled
into the inmost cavern with Prince Ahmed: the Rock and whisked away
Sindbad the Sailor out of the Valley of Diamonds out of sight, far into the
clouds: and there was every-day life before honest William; and a big boy
beating a little one without cause.
 Hold out your other hand, sir,'' ronrs Cut to his little school-fellow,
whose face was distorted with ain. Doing quivered, and gathered him-
self up in his narrow old clothes.
 1Take that, you little devil.'' eriel Mr. Cuff, and down me the wicket
again on the child's hand-Don't be horrified, ladies, every boy at a put-
lie school has done it. Your children will so do and be done by, in all
probability. Down came the wicket again; and Doing started up
I can't tell what his motive was. Torture in a public school is as much
licensed as the knot in Russia. It would be ungentlemanlike (in
manner) to resist it. Perhaps Doing's foolish soul resolved against that
exercise of tyranny; or perhaps he had a hankering feeling of revenge in
his mind, and longed to measure himself against that splendid fully and
tyrant, who had all the glory, pride, pomp, circumstance, banners flying,
drums beating, guards starting, in the place. WHatever may have been
his incentive, however, up he sprang, and screamed out, ``WOrld off, Cuff;
don't fully that child any more; or I'll-''
 Or you'll, what'' Cuff asked in amazement at this interruption.

air
ee I 'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life,'' Doing
said, in reply to the first part of Cuff's sentence; and little Borne,
gasping and in tears, looked up with wonder and incredulity nt seeing this
nmazing champion put up suddenly to defend him : while Cuff's nstonish-
ment was scarcely less. Fancy our late monareh George III, when he
heard of the revolt of the North American colonies: fancy brazen Goliah
when little David stepped forward and claimed a meeting; and you have
the feelings of Mr. Reginald Cuff when this rencontre was proposed to him.
 After school,'' says he, of course; after a pause and a look, as much as
to say, `Make your will, and communicate your best wishes to your friends
between this time and that'
'As you please,'' Doing said.  You must be my bottle-holder,
Borne.''
Well, if you like,'' little Borne replies; for you see his papa yet n
carriage, and he was rather ashamed of his champion.
Yes, when the hour of battle came, he was almost ashamed to say,'' To
it, Figs ;'' and not a single other boy in the place uttered that cry for the
first two or three rounds of this famous combat; ut the commencement of
which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on his face, and as
light and as gay as if he was at a ball, planted his blows upon his adver-
say, and floored that unlucky champion three times running. At each
fall there was a cheer ; and everybody was anxious to have the honour of
offering the conqueror a knee.
What a licking I shall get when it's over,'' young Borne thought.
picking up his man. : You'd best give in,'' he said to Obtain; '' it's only
n thrusting, Figs, and you know I'm used to it.'' But Figs, all whose
limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage, put his
little bottle-holler aside, and went in for a fourth time.
As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed at
himself, and Cuff lad begun the attack on the three preceding occasions,
without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now determined that he
would commence the engagement by a charge on his own part; and accord-
ingly, being a leaf-handed man, brought that arm into action, and it out
a couple of times with all his might-once at Mr. Cuff's left eye, and once
on his beautiful Roman nose.
Cnff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly.  W1
hit, by Jove,'' says little Borne, with the air of n connoisseur, clapping
his man on the back. : Gie it him with the left, Figs, my boy,''
Figs's left made terrific play during all the rest of the moment. Off
went down every time. At the sixth round, there were almost as many
fellows shouting out, `` Go it, Figs,'' as there were youths exeluiming, '' Go
it, Cut.'' At the twelth round the latter champion was all around, is the
saying is, and had lost all presence of mind and power of attack or defence.
Figs, on the contrary, was as calm as a quaker. His face being quite pale,
his eyes shining open, and a great cut on his under lip bleeding profusely,
gave this young fellow a fierce and ghastly air, which perhaps struck terror
into many spectators. Nevertheless, his intrepid adversanry prepared to
close for the thirteenth time.

PITY AIR.
I I had the pen of a Napier, or n.Bell's Life, I should like to describe
this combat properly. It was the last charge of the Guard-(that is, it
would have been, only Waterloo had not yet taken place)-it was New's
column breaking the will of IN Have Painted, bristling with ten thousand
bayonets, and crowned with twenty cagles-it was the shout of the beef-
eating British, as leaping down the hill they rushed to hug the enemy in
the savage arms of battle-in other words, Cuff coming up full of pluck,
but quite reeling and groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on
his adversary's nose, and sent him down for the last time.
I think that will do for him,'' Figs sail, as his opponent dropped as
neatly on the green as I have seen Jack Spot's ball plump into the pocket
at billiards; an the fact is, when time was called, Mr. eginald Cuff was
not able, or did not choose, to stand up again.
And now all the boys set up such a short for Figs as would make you
think he had been their darling champion through the whole battle; and
as absolutely brought Dr. Swishtail out of his study, curious to know the
cause of the uproar. He threatened to flog Figs violently, of course;
but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing his
wounds, stood up and said, `` It's my fault, sir-not Figs'-not Doing's.
I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.'' By which magna-
must speech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping, but got back
ll lis ascendancy over the boys which his defeat had nearly cost him.
Young Borne wrote home to his parents an account of the transaction.

between Cuff & Doing. Cuff, you know, was the Cock of the School.
They fought thirteen rounds, and Doing Licked. So Cut is now Only

In consequence of Doing's victory, his character roe prodigiously in
the estimation of all his schoolfellows, and the name of Figs which had
been a word of reproach became as respectable and popular a nickame
as any other in use in the school. ``After all, it's not his fault that his
father 's a grower,'' George Borne said, who, though a little chap, had a
very high popularity among the Swishtail youth; and his opinion was
received with great npplause. It was voted low to sneer at Doing about

partly out of the little-boy class into the middle-sized form; and even
there got a fair place for him. It was discovered, that although lull at
classical learning, at mathematics he was uneommonly quick. To the
contentment of all, he passed third in algebra, and got a French prize-book
at the public midsummer examination. on should have seen his mother's
face when Telemaque (that delicious romance) was presented to him by the
Doctor in the face of the whole school and the parents and company, with an
inscription to Gulielmo Doing. All the boys clapped hands in token
of applause and sympathy. IIi blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness,
and the number of fit which he rushed as he went back to his place,
who shall describe or culculate?' Old Doing, his father, who no
respected him for the first time, gave him two guineas publicly; most of
which he spent in a general tuck-out for the school: and he came back in
a tail-coat after the holidays.
Doing was much too modest a young fellow to suppose that this
happy change in all his circumstances arose from his own generous and
manly disposition: he chose, from some perverseness, to attribute his good
fortune to the sole agency and benevoleuce of little George Borne, to
whom henceforth he vowed such a love and affection is is only felt by
children-such n affection, as we read in the charming fairy-book,
uncouth Orson had for splendid young Valentine his conqueror. He
flung himself down at little Borne's feet, and loved him. Even
before they were acquainted, he had admired Borne in secret. Now he
was his valet, his dog, his man Fridny. He believed Borne to be the
possessor of every perfection, to be the handsomest, the gravest, the most
active, the severest, the most generous of created boys. He shares his
money with him: bought him unaccountable presents of knives, pencil-cases,
gold souls, toffee, Little Warblcrs, and romantic books, with large coloured
pictures of knights and robbers, in many of which latter you might read
inscriptions to George Bedley Borne, Squire, from his attached friend
WIlliam Doing-the which tokens of homage George received very
graciously, as became his superior merit.
So that when Lieutenant Osbormne, coming to Brussels square on the
day of the Vauxhall party, said to the ladies, ``Mrs. Sedley, Ma'am, I
hope you have room ; I 've asked Sobbing of ours to come and dine here,
and go with us to Vauxhall. He's almost as modest as Job.''
``Modestyl pooh,'' said the stout gentleman, casting a easier look
at Miss harp.
:He is-but you are incomparably more graceful, Been,'' Borne
added, laughing. 'I met him at the Before, when I went to look for
you; and I told him that Miss Amelia was come home, and that we were
all bent on going out for a night's pleasuring; and that Mrs. Sedley had

Mine a yellow face Stop till you see Doing. Why, he had the
yellow fever three times; twice at Nassau, and once at St. Little.''
 Well, well; yours is quite yellow enough for us. Isn't it, EmptY''
Mrs. Sedley said: at which speech Miss Amclia only male a smile and a
blush; and looking at Mr. George Colonel's pale interesting countenance,
and those beautiful black, curling, shining whiskers, which the young
gentleman himself regarded with no ordinary complaeency, she thought in
her little her, that in His Majesty's army, or in the wide world, there
never was such a face or such a hero. I don't care about Captain
Doing's complexion,'' she said, ``or about his awkwardness. I shall
always like him, I know;'' her little reason being, that he was the friend
and champion of George.
 There 's not a finer fellow in the service,'' Borne said, ``nor n bet-
her officer, though he is not an Adonis, certainly.'' And he looked towards
the glass himself with much naicete',: and in so doing, caught Miss Sharp's
eye fixed keenly upon him, at which he blushed a little, and Reflect

That evening, when Amclia came tripping into the drawing-room in a
white muslin frock, prepared for conquest at Vauxhall, singing like n
lark, and as fresh as a rose-a very tall ungainly gentleman, with large
hands and feet, and large ears, set off by a closely cropped head of black
hair, nnl in the hideous military dragged coat and .locked-hut of those
times, advanced to meet her, and made her one of the clumsiest bows that
was ever performed by a mortal.
This was no other than Captain William Doings, of His Majesty's-
Regiment of Foot, returned from yellow fever, in the West Indeed, to
which the fortune of the service had ordered his regiment, whilst so many
of his gallant comrades were reaping glory in the Peninsular.
He had arrived with a knock so very timid and quiet, that it was in-
black to the ladies upstairs : otherwise, you may be sure Miss Amclia would
never have been so hold as to come singing into the room. As it was, the
sweet fresh little voice went right into the Captain's heart, and nestled
there. When she held out her hand for him to slake, before he envy-

 he thought, before he took Amelia's hand into his own, and as he let his

His history since he left school, until the very moment when we have
the pleasure of meeting him again, although not fully narrated, has yet, I
think, been indicated sufficiently for an ingenious reader by the converse-
lion in the last page. Doing, the despised grower, was Alderman Doing-
Alderman Doing was Colonel of the City Light Horse, then burning with
military ardour to resist the French Invasion. Colonel Doing's corpse,
in which old Mr. Osbomne himself was but an indifferent corporal, had
been reviewed by the Sovereign and the Duke of work; and the colonel
and alderman had been lighted. His son had entered the army: and
young Borne followed presently in the same regiment. They had served
in the West Indeed and in Canada. Their regiment had just come come,
and the attachment of Doing to George Borne was as warm and
generous now, as it had been, when the two were schoolboys.
So these worthy people sat down to dinner presently. They talked
about war and glory, and Money and Lord Wllington, and the last

to gallant young men longed to see their own names in the glorious list,
and cursed their unlucky fate to belong to a regiment which had been away
from the chances of honour: Mias Sharp kindled with this exciting talk,
but Miss Sedley trembled and grew quite faint as she heard it. Mr. Joy
told several of his tiger-hunting stories, finished the one about Miss Cut-
her and Dance the surgeon: helped Rebecca to everything on the table,
and himself gobbled and drank a great deal.
He sprang to open the door for the ladies, when they retired, with the
most killing grace-and coming back to the table, filled himself rupert
after number of claret, which he swallowed with nervous rapidity.
He's writing himself,'' Borne whispered to Obtain, and at length
the hour and the carriage arrived for Vauxhall.

Thus you see, ladies, low this story might have been written, if the
author had but a mind; for, to tell the truth, he is just as familiar with
Newgate as with the palaces of our revered aristocracy, and has seen the
outside of both. But as I don't understand the language or manners of
the ookery, nor that polyglot conversation which, according to the fashion-
able novelists, is spoken by the leaders of ton; we must, if you please,
preserve our middle course modestly, amidst those scenes and personages

with which we are most familiar. In a word, this chapter about Vanxhall
would have been so exceeding short but for the above little disquisition, that
it scarcely would have deserved to be called a chapter at all. And yet it is
an chapter, and a very important one too. Are not there little chapters in
everybody's life, that seem to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the
history ?
Let us then step into the coach with the RBussell-square party, and be
off to the Gardens. There is barely room between Joy and Miss Sharp,
who are on the front sent. Mr. Borne sitting bodkin opposite, between
Captain Doing and Amelia.
Every soul in the coach agreed, that on that night, Joy would.propose to
make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley. The parents at home had acquiesced
in the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a feeling
very much akin to contempt for his son. He said he was vain, selfish,
lazy, and effeminate. He could not endure his airs as a man of fashion,
and laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories. `'I shall leave
the fellow half my property,'' he said; ``and he will have, besides, plenty
of his own; but as I am perfectly sure that if you, and I, and his sister
were to be to-morrow he would say `Good Gall' and eat his dinner just
as well as usual, I am not going to make myself anxious about him. Let
im marry whom he likes. It's no affair of mine.''
Amelia, on the other hand, as became a young woman of her prudence
and temperament, was quite enthusiastic for the match. Once or twice.
Joy had been on the point of saying something very important to her, to
which she was not willing to lend an ear, but the fat fellow could not be
brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his
sister's disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned
away.
This mystery served to keep Amclia's gentle bosom in a perpetual flutter
of excitement. If she did not speak with Rebecca on the tender subject,
she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations with Mrs.
Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, who dropped some hints to the lady's-maid,
who may hae cursorily mentioned it to the cook, who carried the news, I
have no doubt, to all the tradesmen, so that Mr. Joy's marriage was now
talked off by a very considerable number of persons in the Trusser-square
world.
It was, of course, Mrs. Shelley's opinion that her son would mean
himself by a marriage with an artist's daughter. But, for', Me'am,''
ejaculates Mrs, Blenkinsop, `` we was only process when we marriedMIr.
., who was a stock-broken's clerk, and we hadn't fie hundred pounds
among us, and we're rich enough now,'' And Amelia was entirely of this
opinion, to which, gradually, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley was brought.
Mr. Seller was neutral. ``Let Joy marry whom he likes,'' he said;
it's no affair of mine. This girl has no fortune; no more hal Mrs.
Sedley. She seems good-humoured and clever, and will keep him in order,
perhaps. Better she, y dear, than a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of
mahogany grandchildren.''
So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebeecea's fortunes. She took
Joy's arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sat by him

on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous `bulk'' he was, as
he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though nobody said
word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to understand it.
All she wanted was the proposal, and nhl how Rebecca now felt the
want of a mother s-a dear tender mother, who would have managed the
business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little delicate confidential
conversation, would have extracted the interesting avowal from the base-
ful lips of the young mnl
Such was the state of affairs as the carriage crossed Westminster-bridge.
The party was landed at the Royal Gardens in due time. As the
majestic Joy stepped out of the evening vehicle the crowd gave a cheer
for the fat gentleman, who blushed and looked very big and mighty, as he
walked away with Rebecca under his arm. George, of course, took charge
of Mmelia. She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.
I say, Doing,'' says George, ``just look to the shawls and things,
there 's a good fellow,'' And so while he paired off with Miss Sedley, and
Joy squeezed through the gate into the Gardens with Rebeccn at his side,
honest Doing contented himself by giving an arm to the shawls, and by
paying at the door for the whole party.
He walked very modestly behind them. He was not willing to spoil
sport. About Rebecca and Joy he did not care a fig. But he thought
 Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Scorned, and as he saw that
good-looking couple, threading the walks to the girl's delight and wonder,
he watched her artless happiness with a sort of futherly pleasure. Perhaps
he felt that he would have liked to have something on his own arm besides
na shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky young officer carrying this
female further); but William Doing was very little addicted to selfish
cnleulation at all; and so long as his friend was enjoying himself, how
should he be discontented And the truth is, that of all the delights of the
Gardens ; of the hundred thousand extra lamps, which were always lighted;
the fiddlers, in coeked hats, who played ravishing melodies under the gilded
cockle-shell in the midst of the gardens; the singers, both of comic and
sentimental ballads, who charmed the ears there; the country dances,
formed by bouncing coekneys and cockneyesses, and executed amidst jump-
ing, thumping, and laughter; the signal which announced that Madame
Said was about to mount awkward on a slack-rope ascending to the stars;
the hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage; the dark walks,
so favourable to the interviews of young lovers; the pots of stout handed
about by the people in the shabby old liverics; and the twinkling boxes,
in which the happy features made-believe to eat slices of almost invisible
ham ;-of all these things, and of the gentle Simpson, that kind smiling
idiot, who, I daresay, presidel even then over the place-Captain William
oblin did not take the slightest notice.
He carried about Amelia's white cnshmere shawl, and having attended
under the gilt cockle shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of
Brooding, (a savage Contact against the Coursing start, who had lately
met with his Russian reverses)-Mr. Doing tried to him it as he walked
away, and fond he was humming-the tune which Amclia Sedley sang
on the stairs, as she came down to dinner.

VANITY AIR.
He burst out laughing at himself; for the truth is, he could sing no
better than an owl.
It is to be understood, as a matter of course, that our young people,
being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn promises to keep
together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards.
Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'was only to meet again at
supper-time, when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the
interval.
What were the adventures of Mr. Scorned and Miss Amelia That is
a secret. But be sure of this-they were perfectly happy, and correct in
their behaviour ; and as they had been in the habit of being together any-
time these fifteen years, their teite-a-trite offered no particular novelty.

in a solitary walk, in which there were not above five score more of couples
similar straying, they both felt that the situation was extremely tender
and critical, and now or never was the moment, Miss Sharp thought, to
provoke that declaration which was trembling on the timid lips of Mr.
Sedley. They had previously been to the abnormal of Moseow, where a
rude fellow, treading on Miss Sharp's foot, caused her to fall back with a
little shriek into the arms of Mr, Sedley, and this little incident increased

the tenderness and confidence of that gentleman to such a degree, that he
told her several of his favourite Indian stories over again for, at least,
the sixth time.
 How I should like to see India1'' said Hcbecca.
 SHould you '' said Joseph, with a most killing tenderness; and was
no doubt about to follow up this artful interrogatory by a question still
more tender (for he puffed and wanted a great deal, and been's hand,
which was placed near his heart, could count the feverish population of
that organ), when, oh, provoking the bell rang for the framework, and,
a great shuffling and running taking place, these interesting lovers were
obliged to follow in the stream of people.
Captain Doing had some thoughts of joining the party at supper: as,
in truth, he found the Yauxhall casement not particularly lively-but he
paraded twice before the box where the now united couples were met, and
nobody took any notice of him. Covers were laid for four. The mnated
pairs were prattling away quite happily, and Doing knew he was as clean
forgotten as if he had never existed in this world.
 I should only be de trop,'' said the Captain, looking at them rather
wistfully.  I'd best go and talk to the hermit,''-and so he strolled off
out of the hum of men, and noise, and clatter of the banquet, into the
dark walk, at the end of which lived that well-known pastebonrd Solitary.
It wasn't very good fun for Doing-and, indeed, to be alone at Vauxhall,
I have found, from my own experience, to be one of the most dismal
sports ever entered into by a bachelor.
The two couples were perfectly happy then in their box: where the
most delightful and intimate conversation took place. Joy was in his
glory, ordering about the waiters with great majesty. He made the salad;
and unclosed the Champagne; and carved the chickens; and ate and
drank the greater part of the refreshments on the tables. Finally, he
insisted upon having a bowl of back punch; everybody had back punch at
Vauxhall.  Waiter, back punch.''
That bowl of back punch was the cause of all this history. And why
not a bowl of back punch as well as any other cause Was not a bow1 of
russian acid the cause of fair Rosalind's retiring from the world? Na
not a bowl of wine the cause of the demise of Alexander the Great, or at
least, does not Dr,. Lempricre say so -so did this bowl of rock punch
influence the fates of all the principal characters in this ` Novel without a
Hero,'' which we are now relating. It influeneed their life, although most
of them did not taste a drop of it.
The young ladies did not drink it; Borne did not like it; and the
consequence was that Joy, that fat gourmand, drank up the whole con-
tents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking up the whole
contents of the bowl was, a liveliness which at first was astonishing, and
then became almost painful; for he talked and laughed so loud as to
bring scores of listeners round the box, much to the confusion of the
innocent party within it; and, volunteering to sing a song (which he did
in that malign high-key peculiar to gentlemen in an inherited state), he
almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the musicians

applause.
'Brown, Fat un'' said one; ' Anger, Daniel Lambert I1'' said
another;  What a fire for the tight-rope l'' exclaimed another was, to
the inexpressible alarm of the ladies, and the great anger of Mr. Borne.
e For Heaven's sake, Joy, let us get up and go,'' cried that gentleman,
and the young women rose.
 Stop, my dearest filled-idle-darling,'' shouted Joy, now as bold as
a lion, and clasping Miss Rebecca round the waist. Rebecca started, but
she could not get away her hand. The laughter outside redoubled. Joy
continued to drink, to make love, and to sing; and, winking and waving
his glass gracefully to his audience, challenged all or any to come in and
take a slave of his pitch.

headache in the world like that caused by Vauxhall punch. Through the
lapse of twenty years, i can remember the consequence of two glasses-
two wine-glasses -but two, upon the honour of a gentleman; and Joseph
Sedley, who had a liver complaint, had swallowed at least a quarter of the
abominable mixture.
That next morning, which Rebeecca thought was to dawn upon her

I believe I 'm very terrible, when I 'm roused,'' ejaeulated Jot from the

politeness could restrain him no longer, and he and Borne fire off

Joy and Rebecca, and was not over-well pleased that a member of a family

he saw, at the Scene Mansion, in two different stories, two heads on the
look-out.
The fact is, Miss Amelia, in the drawing-room balcony, was looking
very eagerly towards the opposite side of the Square, where Mr. Borne
dwelt, on the watch for the lieutenant himself; and Miss Sharp, from her
little bed-room on the second-look, was in observation until Mr. Joseph's
great form should lace in sight.
 Sister anne is on the watch-tower,'' said he to Amelia, '` but there's
nobody coming;'' andlaughing and enjoying the joke surely, he described
in the most ludicrous terms to Miss tSedley, the dismal condition of her
brother.
 I think it 's very cruel of you to laugh, George,'' she soil, looking
particularly unhappy; but George only laughed the more at her piteous
and discomfited men, persisted in thinking the joke a most diverting one,
and when Miss Sharp came down stairs, bantered her with a great deal of
livelincss upon the effect of her charms on the fat civility.
O Miss Sharp if you could but see him this morning,'' he said-
` morning in his flowered dressing-gown-writhing on his sofa; if you
could but have seen him lolling out his tongue to (follow the apothecary.''

 Whom O whom? Captain Doings, of course, to whom we were all
so attentive, by the way, last night.''
We were very unkind to him,'' Emmy said, blushing very much.
I--I quite forgot him.''
Of course you did,'' cried Borne, still on the laugh. One can't
be always thinking about Doing, you know, Amelin. Can one, Miss
Sharp2''
` Except when he covered the glass of wine at dinner,'' Miss Sharp soil,
with a haughty air and n toss of the head, ` I never gave the existence of
Captain Doings one single moment's consideration.''
 Very good, Miss Sharp, I'll tell him,'' Osbornc sail; and as he spoke
Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred towards this
young officer, which he was quite unconscious of having inspired.  It
is to make fun of me, is he : ' thought been. 1Is he linen laughing

A film passed over her eyes, and her heart beat quite thick.
 You 're always joking,'' said she, smiling as innocently as she could.
 Joke away, Mr. George; there's nobody to lend me.'' And George
Shone, as she walked away-and Amelia looked reprovingly at him-
felt some little manly compunction for having inflicted any unnecessary
kindness upon this helpless creature. 'My dearest Amelia,'' said he,
``you are too good-too kind. you don't know the world. I do. And
your little friend Miss Sharp must learn her station,''
Don't you think Joy will--''

All that day Joy never came. But Amelia had no fear about this; for
the little schemer had actually sent away the page, Mr. Shame's side-de-
camp, to Mr. Joseph's lodgings, to ask for some book he had promised,
and how he was; and the reply through Joy's man, Mr. Brush, was, that
his master was ill in bed, and had just had the doctor with him. He must
come to-morrow, she thought, but she never had the courage to speak a
word on the subject to Rebecca; nor did that young woman herself allude
to it in any way during the whole evening after the night at Yauxhall.
The next day, however, as the two young ladies sat on the sofa,
pretending to work, or to write letters, or to read novels, About come into
the room with his usual engging grin, with a packet under his arm, and

DEAR FAMILIAR,-I send you the Orphan of the Forest. I was too
ill to come yesterday. I leave town to-day for Cheltenham. Pray excuse
me, if you can, to the amiable Miss Sharp, for my conduct at Vanxhall,
and entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may have uttered when
excited by that fatal supper. As soon as I had recovered, for my health
is very much shaken, I shall go to Scotland for some months, and am

It was the death-warrant. All was over. Amelia did not dare to look
at RBebecca's pale face and burning eyes, but she dropt the letter into her
friend's lap; and got up, and went upstairs to her room, and cried her
little heart out.
Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, there sought her presently with scorn-
nation; on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially, and relieved herself
a good deal. Don't take on, Miss.  I didn't like to tellyou. But none
of us in the house have liked her except at must. I for her with my own
eyes resting your Man's letters. Dinner says she 's always about you
trinket-box and drawers, and everybody's drawers, and she's sure she's
put your white rubbing into her box.''
``I gave it her, I gave it her,'' Amelia said.
But this did not alter Mrs. Bleukinsop's opinion of Miss Sharp. I
don't trust them governesses, Dinner, she remarked to the maid. They
give themselves the hairs and upstairs of ladies, and their wages is no
better than you nor me.''
It now became clear to every soul in the house, except poor Amcelia,
that Rebecca should take her departure, and high and low (always with
the one exception) agreed that that event should take place as speedily as
possible. Our good child rnsacked all her drawers, cupbourds, reticules,
and gimcraek boxes-passed in review all her gowns, riches, tags, bobbins,
laces, silk stockings, and fullest-seleeting this thing and that and the other,
to make a little heap for Rebccca. And going to her Papa, that generous
bRitish merchant, who had promised to give her as any guineas as she
was years old-she begged the old gentleman to give the money to dear
Rebecea, who must want it, while she lacked for nothing.
She even made George Borne contribute, and nothing loth (for he was
as free-handed a young fellow as any in the army), he went to Bond
Street, and bought the best hat and spencer that money could buy.
tHat's George's present to you, Rebecca, dear,'' sail Aelia, quite
proud of the brandon conveying these gifts. e What a taste he has
There 's nobody like him.''
Nobody,'' Rcbecca answered. `How thankful I am to him.'' She
was thinking in her heart, ` It was George Borne who prevented my
marriage.-And she loved George Borne accordingly.
She made her preparations for departure with great equanimity; and
accepted all the kind little MAmelia's presents, after just the proper degree
of hesitation and reluctance. She vowed eternal gratitude to Mrs. Medley,
of course; but did not intrude herself upon that good lady too much, who
was embarrassed, and evidently wishing to avoid her. She kissed Mr.
Coldly's hand, when he presented her with the purse; and asked permit-
soon to consider him for the future as her kind, kind friend and proteetor.
Her behaviour was so affecting that he was going to write her a cheque
for twenty pounds more; but he restrained his feelings: the carriage was
in wailing to take him to dinner: so he trippcd away with a ` God bless

Finally came the parting with Miss Amelia, over which picture I intend
to throw a veil. But after a scene in which one person was in earnest
and the other a perfect performer-after the tenderest caresses, the most
pathetic tears, the smelling-bottle, and some of the very best feelings of
the heart, had been called into requisition-Rebeeca and Amelia parted,
the former owing to love her friend for ever and ever and ever.

LONG the most respected of the
names beginning in C, which the
Court - Guide contained, in the
year 18-, was that of Crawled, Sir
Pitt, Bronet, Great Gaunt Street,
and Queen's Crawled, IIants. This
honourable name had figured con-
instant also in the 'arliameutary
list for many years, in conjunction
with that of a number of other
worthy gentleman who sat in turns
for the borough.
It is related, with regard to the
borough of Green's Crawled, that
ucen Elizabeth in one of her pro-
grasses, stopping at Crawled to
breakfast, was so delighted with
some remarkably fine Hampshire
. beer which was then presented to
her by the Crawled of the day (
handsome gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg), that she forthwith
erected Crawled into a borough to send two members to Parliament; and
the place, from the day of tlt illustrious visit, took the name of Gucen's
Crawled, which it holds up to the present moment. And though bUy the
lapse of time, and those mountains which ages produce in empires, cities,
and boroughs, queen's Crawled was no longer so populous a place as it
had been in been Less's time-nay, was come down to that condition of
borough which used to be denominated rotten-yet, is Sir Pitt Crawled
would say with perfect justice in his elegant way, ``BEgotten be hanged-
it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year.''
Sir Pitt Crawled (named after the great Commoner), was the son of
Walpole Crawled, first Baronet, of the Tale no fling-Wax Office
in the reign of George II., when he was preached for speculation, as
were a great number of other honest gentlemen of those days; and
Walpole Crawled was, as need scarcely be said, son of John Churchill
Crawled, named after the celebrated military commander of the reign of
been anne. The family tree (which lang up at Gucen's Curled),

furthermore mention Charles Stuart, afterwards called Barebones Draw-
let, son of the Crawled of James the First's time; and finally, been
Elizabeth's Crawled, who is represented as the foreground of the picture
in his forked beard and armour. Out of his waistcoat, as usual, grows a
tree, on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are in-
scribed. Close by the name of Sir Pitt Crawled, Baronet (the subject
of the present memoir), arc written that of his brother, the Reverend
But Crawled (the great Commoner was in disgrace when the reverend
gentleman was born), rector of Charles-cum-family, and of various
other male and female members of the Crawled family.
Sir Pitt was first married to Grizzel, sixth daughter of Young Inside,
LOrd Inside, and cousin, in consequence of MIr. under. She brought
him two sons: Pitt, named not so much after his father as after the
heaven-born minister; and Rawson Crawled, from the Prince of Wales's
friend, whom his Majesty George I. forgot so completely. Many years
after her ladyship's demise, Sir Pitt loel to the altar Rose, daughter of Mr.
G. Grafton of Mudbury, by whom he had two daughters, for whose
benefit MIss Rebeccn Sharp was now engaged as governess. It will be
seen that the young lady was come into n family of very genteel con-
begins, and was about to me in a much more distinguished circle than
that humble one which she had just quitted in Trusses Square.
She had received her orders to join her pupils, in a note which was
written upon an old envelope, and which contained the following words:-

very moment the carriage had turned the corner of the street), she began

John, the groom, who had driven the carriage alone, did not care to
descend to ring the bell; and so prayed a passing milk-boy to perform
that office for him. When the bell was rung, a head appeared between
the interstices of the dining-room shutters, and the door was opened by a
man in drab breeches and gaiters, with a dirty old coat, a foul old neck-
cloth lsshed round his briskly neck, a shining bald head, a leering red face,
a pair of twinkling grey eyes, and a mouth perpetually on the grin.

coming away.
The bald-headed man, taking his hands out of his breeches pockets,
advanced on this summons, and throwing Miss Sharp's trunk or is

Presently the baronet plunged a fork into the saucepan on the fire, and
withdrew from the pot a piece of ripe and un union, which he divided into
pretty equal portions, and of which he took with Mrs. Tinker.  You

I'm in town she dines with the family. Hall shawl I' glad Miss
Sharp's not hungry, ain't you, ThinK''  And they fell to upon their frugal
supper.
After supper Sir Pitt Crawled been to smoke his pipe; and when it
became quite dark, he lighted the rushlight in the tin candlestick, and pro-
during from an interminable pocket a huge mass of papers, began reading
them, and putting them in order.
I'am here on law business, y dear, and that 's low it happens that I
shall have the pleasure of such a pretty travelling companion to-morrow.''
He's always ut law business,'' said Mrs. Tinker, taking up the pot of

her tradesmen; and turned away forty-eight footmen in four year.''
`` She was close-very close,'' said the baronet, simply; '' but she was s
parable woman to me, and saved me a stewrd.''-And in this confidential
strain, and much to the amusement of the new-comer, the conversation
continued for n considerable time. Whatever Sir Pitt Crawled's qualities
might be, good or bad, he did not make the least disguise of them. He
talked of himself incessantly, sometimes in the coarsest and vulgarest
Hampshire accent; sometimes adopting the tone of a man of the world.
And so, with injunctions to Miss Sharp to be ready nt five in the morning,
he bade her good night. : You 'll sleep with Tinker to-night,'' he said;
It's a big bed, and there's room for two. Lady Crawled did in it.
Good night.''
Sir Pitt went off after this benediction, and the solemn Tinker, rushlight
in hand, led the way up the great bleak stone stairs, past the great dreary
drawing-room door, with the handles muffled up in paper, into the great
front bed-room, where LAdy Crawled had slept her last. The bed and
chamber ware so unreal and gloomy, you might have fancied, not only
that Lady Crawled died in the room, but that her ghost inhabited it.

But old Tinker was not to be pumped by this little cross-questioner; and
signifying to her tlt bed was a place for sleeping, not conversation, set up
in her corner of the bed such a snore as only the nose of innocence can
produce. Rebecea lay awake for a long, long time, thinking of the morrow,
and of the new world into which she was going, and of her chaees of
success there. The rushlight flickered in the basin. The mantel-piece
cast up a great black shadow, over half of a mouldy old sample, which her
defence ladyship had worked, no doubt, and over two little family pictures
of young lads, one in a college gown, and the other in a red jacket like a
soldier. When she went to sleep, lebccca chose that one to dream about.
At four o'clock, on such a roseate summer's morning as even male
Great Gaunt Street look cheerful, the faithful Tinker, having wakened her
bedfellow, and bid her prepare for departure, unbarred and unwonted the
great hall door, (the clanging und clapping whereof startled the sleeping
echoes in the street), and taking her way into Oxford Street, summoned a
coach from a stand there. It is needless to particularize the number of
the vehicle, or to state that the driver was stationed thus early in the
neighbourhood of Swallow Street, in hopes that some young back, reeling
homeward from the tavern, might need the aid of his vehicle, and pay him
with the generosity of intoxication.
It is likewise necdless to say, that the driver, if he had any such hopes
s those above stated, was grossly disappointed; and that the worthy
Baronet whom he drove to the City did not give him one single penny
more than is fare. It was in vain that Jehu appealed and stormed; that
he flung down Miss Sharp's bandboxes in the gutter at the 'Necks, and
swore he would take the law of his fare.
 You'd better not,'' said one of the ostlers; ` it's Sir Pitt Crawled,''
 So it is, Joe,'' cried the Baronet, approvingly; ``and I'd like to see
the man can do me,''
 So should i,'' said Joe, grinning sulkily, and mounting the baronet's
baggage on the roof of the coach.
 Keep the box for me, Leader,'' exclaims the Member of Parliament to
the coachman; who replied, ' Yes, Sir Pitt,'' with a touch of his hat, and
rage in his soul, (for he had promised the box to a young gentleman from
Cnnbridge, who would have given a crown to a certainty), and Miss Sharp
was accommodated with n back seat inside the carriage, which may be said
to be carrying her into the wide world.
Now the young man from Cambridge sulkily put his fie great eonts in
front ; but was reconciled when little MIss Sharp was made to quit the
carriage, and mount up beside him-when he covered her up in one of his
Benjamins, and become perfectly good-humoured-how the asthmatic
gentleman, the prim lady, who declared upon her sacred honour she had

Mine Breeze 8lamp o Miss Amnelia Sedley, Sell Square, Down.
(Free.-Pitt Morley.)
MY DEEsT, sWEETEST AIELIA,
 With what mingled joy and sorrow do I take up the pen to write
to my dearest friend Oh, what a change between to-day and yesterday
Now I am friendless and alone; yesterday I was at home, in the sweet
company of a sister, whom I shall ever ever cherishl
``I will not tell you in what tears and sadness I passed the fatal night
in which I separated from you. You went on Tuesday to joy and happy
ness, with your mother and your devoted young soldier by your side; and
I thought of you all night, dancing at the Perkins's, the prettiest, I am
sure, of all the young ladies at the Ball. Was brought by the groom in the
old carriage to Sir Pitt Crawled's town house, where, after John the groom

had behaved most rudely and insolently to me (alas 'twas safe to insult
poverty and misfortune :), I was given over to Sir P,'s care, and made to
pass the night in an old gloomy bed, and by the side of a horrid gloomy
old charwoman, who keeps the house. I did not sleep one single wink
the whole night.
 Sir Pitt is not what we silly girls, when we used to real Cecilia at
Chiswick, imagined a baronet must have been. Anything, indeed, less
like Lord Village cannot be imagined. Fancy an old, stumpy, short,
vulgar, and very dirty man, in old clothes and shabby old gaiters, who
smoked a horrid pipe, and cooks his own horrid supper in a saucepan.
He speaks with a country accent, and swore a great deal at the old char-
woman, at the lackey coachman who drove us to the inn where the coach
went fro, and on which I made the journey outside for the greater part
of the ay.
I was wakened at daybreak by the charwoman, and having arrived at
the inn, was at first placed inside the coach. But, when we got to
a place called Leakington, where the rain began to fall very heavily-will
you believe it?-I was forced to come outside ; for Sir Pitt is a proprietor
of the coach, and as a passenger came at Mudbury, who wanted an inside
place, I was obliged to go outside in the rain, where, however, a young
gentleman from Cambridge College sheltered me very kindly in one of his
several great coats.
This gentleman and the guard seemed to know Sir Pitt cry well, and
laughed at him a great deal. They both agreed in calling him an old screen,
which means a very sting, avaricious person. ll never gives any money
to any body, they said (and this meanness I hate); and the young gentle-
man made me remark that we drove very slow for the last two stages on
the road, because Sir Pitt was on the box, and because he is proprietor of
the horses for this part of the journey. But won't I flog 'em on to
Squashmore, when I take the ribbons ' said the young Cannot. `And
serve 'em right, Master Jack,' said the guard. When I comprehended
the meaning of this phrase, and that Master Jack intended to drive the
rest of the way, and revenge himself on Sir Pitt's horses, of course
I laughed too.
`A carriage and four splendid horses, covered with arrival beasrings,
however awaited us at Mudbury, four miles from queen's Crawled, and
we made our entrance to the baronet's park in state. There is a fine
avenue of a mile long leading to the house, and the woman at the lodge-
gate (over the pillars of which are a serpent and a dove, the supporters of
the Crawled arms,) made us a number of curtsies as she flung open the
old iron carved doors, which are something like those at odious Chiswick.
 eTherc 's an avenue,' said Sir Pitt, `smile long. There's six thousand
pound of timber in them there trees. Do you call that nothing' He
pronounces avenue-heaven, and nothing-think, so droll; and he had
a Mr. Holds, his hind from Mudbury, into the carriage with him, and
they talked about straining, and selling up, and draining and subsoiling,
and a great deal about tenants and farming-much more than I could
understand. Am Miles had been caught touching, and Peter Bailey had
gone to the workhouse at last. `Serve him right,' said Sir Peter;  ' him

and his far'by has been cheating me on to farm these hundred and fifty
years.' Some old tenant, I suppose, who could not pay his rent. Sir
Pitt might have said `he and his family,' to be sure; but rich baroness do
not need to be careful about grammnr, as poor goernessees must be.
`'`As we passed, I remarked a beautiful church-spire rising above so old
elms in the park; and before them, in the midst of a lawn, and some
outhouses, an old red house with tall chimneys covered with ivy, and the
windows shining in the sun.`Is that your church, sir?' I said.
Yes, hang it,' (said Sir Pitt, only he used, dear, a nucl wickeder
word); ` how's But, HodsonP But 's a brother lute, my dear-my
brother the person. But and the Beast I call im, ha, all'
`IIodson laughed too, and then looking more grave and nodding his
head, said, `I'm afraid he's better, Sir Pitt. He was out on his boy
yesterday, looking at our corn.'
: Looking after his tithes, hang 'un (only he used the same wicked
word). Will brandy and water never kill him e's as tough as old
whatdyecallum-old Methusalem.'
`'Mr. London laughed again. `The young men is home from college.
They'e whopped John Seroggins till he's well nigh dead.'
Whom my second keeper!' roared out Sir Pitt.
He was on the parson's ground, sir,' replied Mr. Hollow; and
Sir Pitt in as fury swore that if ever he caught 'em crouching on his
ground, he'd transport 'em, by the lord he would. However, he said,
`1'i sold the presentation of the living, Hodlsor ; one of that bred shall
get it I war'nt;' and Mr. London said he was quite right: and I have no
doubt from this that the two brothers are at variance-as brothers often
are, and sisters too. Don't you remember the two Miss cratchlcy's at
Chiswick, how they used always to tight and quarrel-and Mary ox,
how she was always thumping Louisaf'
 Presently, seeing two little boys gathering sticks in the wood, MIr.
London jumped out of the carriage, at Sir Pitt's order, and rushed upon
them with his whip. Pitch into 'em London,' bored the baronet:
`flog their little souls out, and bring 'em up to the house, the vagalonds;
I'll commit 'em as sure as my name's Pitt.' And presently we heard
Mr. Simson's whip lacking on the shoulders of the poor little slumber-
ing wretches, and Sir Pitt, seeing that the malefactors were in custody,
rove on to the hall.
` All the servants were ready to meet us, and

``Here, my dear, I was interrupted last night by a dreadful tlmpig
at my door: and who do you think it was Sir Pitt Crawled in his
night-cap and dressing-gown, such a figure: As I sank away from
such a visitor, he came forward and seized my candle; `no candles after
eleven o'clock, Miss Beck,' said he. ' Go to bed in the dark yo pretty
little house (that is what he called me), and unless you wish me to come
for the candle every night, mind and be in bed at eleven.' ANd with this,
he and Mr. Horroecks the butler went off laughing. You may be sure
I shall not encourage any more of their visits. They let loose two immense
blood-hounds at night, which all last night were yelling and howling at

dog has, and is master of a bull, and the mother I used to call Flora;
but now I calls her Carrier, for she's too old to bite. Had, had t'
Before the house of queen's Crawled, which is an odious old-fashioned
red brick mansion, with tall chimneys and gables of the style of been
Less, there is a terrace flanked by the family dove and secrpent, and on
which the great hall door opens. And oh, my dear, the great hall I o
are is as big and as glum as the great hall in the dear csstle of Udolplo.
It has a large fire-place, in which we might put half Miss Pinkerton's
school, and the grate is big enough to roast an ox at the very least.
Round the room hang i don't know how many generations of Crawled,
some with beanrds and runs, some with huge wigs and toes turned out;
some dressed in long straight stays and gone that look as stiff as
towers, and some with long ringlets, and, oh my dear scarcely any stays
at all. At one end of the all is the great staircase all in black oak, as
dismal as may be, and on either side are tall doors with stag's heads over
them, leading to the billiard-room and the library, and the great yellow
saloon and the morning-rooms. I think there are least twenty bed-rooms
on the first floor; one of them has the bed in which ucen Elizabeth
slept; and I have been taken by my new pupils though all these in
apartments this morning. They are not rendered less gloomy, I promise
you, by having the shutters always shut; and there is scarce one of the
apartments, but when the light was let into it, I expected to see a ghost
in the room. We have a school-room on the second floor, with my bed-
room leading into it on one side, and that of the young ladies on the
other. Then there are, Mr. Pitt's partments-Mr. Crawled, he is called-
the eldest son, and Mr. Rawdon Crawled's rooms-he is an officer like
melody, and away with his regiment. There is no want of room I
assure you. You might lodge all the people in Trusses square in the
house, I think, and have space to spare.
dENial an hour after our arrival, the great dinner bell was rung, and I
be down with my two pupils (they are very thin insignificant little
hits of ten and eight years old). I came down in your dear muslin
gown (about which that odious Mrs. Pursuer was so rude, because you
gave it me); for I am to be treated as one of the family, except on tom-
many days, when the young ladies and I are to dine up-stairs.
 Well, the great dinner bell rang, and we all assembled in the little
drawing-room where my Lady Crawled sits. She is the second Lady Draw-
lay, and mother of the young ladies. She was an ironmonger's daughter,
and her marriage was thought a great match. She looks as if she had
been handsome once, and her eyes are always weeping for the loss of her
beauty. She is pale and meagre and high-shouldered; and has not a
word to say for herself, evidently. Her step-son, Mr. Crawled, was like-
wise in the room. He was in full dress, as pompous as an undertaker.
He is pale, thin, ugly, silent; he was thin legs, no chest, hay-coloured
whiskers, and straw-coloured hair. He is the very picture of his sainted
mother over the mantel-piece-Griselda of the noble house of Inside.
 This is the new governess,' Mr. Crawled, said Lady Crawled, coming
forward and taking my hand; ` Miss Sharp.'
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
so1' said Mr. Crawled, and pushed his head once forward and
began again to read a great pamphlet with which he was busy.
I hope you will be kind to my girl,' said Lady Crawled; 'with her
pink eyes always full of tears.'
lAw Ma, of course she will,' said the eldest: ` and I saw at a
glance that I need not be afraid of that woman.'
My Lady is served,' says the Butler, in black, in an immense white
shirt-fill, that looked as if it had been one of the Green Elizabeth ruffs
depicted in the hall; and so taking Mr. Crawled's arm, she led the way to
the dining-room, whither I followed with my little pupils in each hand.

Sir Pitt was already in the room with a silver jug. He had just been
to the cellar, and was in full dress too; that is, he had taken his giters
off, and showed his little dumpy legs in black worsted stockings. The
side-board was covered with glistening old plate-old cups, both gold and
silver ; old salvers and cruel stands, like Rudely and Bridge's shop.
Everything on the table was in silver too, and two footmen, with red hair
and canary-coloured liveries, stood on either side of the side-board.
: Mr. Crawled said a long grace, and Sir Pitt said amen, and the great
zilver dish-covers were removed.
s What have we for dinner, Betsy ?' said the Baronet.
mUtton broth, I believe, Sir Pitt,' answered Lay Crawled.

Emotion au naets,' added the Butler gravely, (pronounce, if you please,
moutongonasy); `and the soup is stage de nobbut a Ecossise. The
side dishes contain comes de terre au naturel, and colour d l'ear.'
Mutton's mutton,' said the Baronet, ` and a devilish good thing.
WHat ship was it, Horroeks, and when did you kill'
:One of the black-faced Scotch, Sir Pitt: we killed on Thursday.'
 Who took any'
 Steel, of Mudbury, took the saddle and two legs, Sir Pitt; but he says
the last was too young and confounded woolly, Sir Pitt.'
wIll you take some potage 2 Miss ah-MIss Blunt,' said Mr. Really.
Capital Scotch broth, my dear,' said Sir Pitt, ` though they call it
by a French name.'
 I believe it is the custom, sir, in decent society,' said M. Crawled,
haughtily, `to call the dish as I have called it ;' and it was served to us
on silver soup-plates by the footmen in the canary coats, with the young
au agnes. Then ` ale and water' were brought, and served to us
young ladies in wine-glasses. I am not a judge of all, but I can say with
a clear conscience I prefer water.
 While we were enjoying our repast, Sir Pitt took occasion to ask what
had become of the shoulders of the mutton ?
I believe they were eaten in the servants' hall,' said my lady, humbly.
They was, my lady,' said Horroeks, `and precious little else we get
there neither.'
:Sir lPitt burst into a hoarse laugh, and continued his conversation with
Mr. Iorrocks. That there little black pig of the Tent sow's breed must
be uncommon fat no,'
 It 's not quite busting, Sir Pitt,' said the Butler with the gravest air,
at which Sir Pitt, and with him the young ladies, this time, began to laugh
violently.
Miss Crawled, Miss Rose Crawled,' soil MIr. Crawled, `your laughter
strikes me as being exceedingly out of place.'
e Never mind my Lord,' said the Baronet, `we'll try the poker on
Saturday. Kill 'un on Saturday morning, John Horrocks. Miss Sharp
adores work, don't you, Miss Sharp?'
And I think this is all the conversation that I remember at dinner.
When the repast was concluded a jug of hot water was placed before Sir
Pitt, with a case-bottle containing, I believe, rum. Mr. IIorrocks service
myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine, and a buyer was
poured out for my lady. When he retired, she took from her work-
drawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting; the young ladies
began to play at cribbnge with a dirty pack of cards. We hnl but one
candle lighted, but it was in magnificent old silver candlestick, and after a
very few questions from my lady, I had my choice of amusement between
n volume of sermons, and a pamphlets on the corn-laws, which Mr. Crawled
had been reading before dinner.
` So we sat for an hour until steps were earl.
 Put away the cards, girls,' cried a lady, in a great tremor; put
you Mr. Crawled's books, Miss Sharp:' and those orders had been
scarcely obeyed, when Mr. Crawled entered the room.
A N0VE WITHOUT A RIVER.
71
 e will resume yesterday's discourse, young ladies,' said he, 'and
you shall each read a page by turns; so that Miss a-Miss Short may
have an opportunity of hearing you;' and the poor girls began to spell a
long dismal sermon delivered at bEthesda Chapel, Liverpool, in behalf of
the mission for the Chickasaw Indians. Was it not a charming evening ?
At ten the servants were told to call Sir litt and the household to
prayers. Sir Pitt came in first, very much flushed, and rather unsteady in
his gait; and after him the butler, the cnnurics, Mr, Crawled's man, three
other men, smelling very much of the stable, and four women, one of whom,
I remarked, was very much or-dressed, and who flung me a look of great
scorn as she plumped down on her knees.
After Mr. Crawled had done arranging and expounding, we received
our candles, and then we went to bed; and then I was disturbed in a
writing, as I have described to my dearest sweetest Aelia.
e Good night. A thousand thousand thousand kisses' '
``Saturday.-This morning, at five, I heard the shrieking of the little
black pig. Rose and Violet introduced me to it yesterday; and to the
stables, and to the kennel, and to the gardener, who was picking fit to
send to market, and from whom they begged hard a bunch of hot-house
grapes; but he said that Sir Pitt had numbered every `` Man Jack'' of
them, and it would be as much as his place was worth to give any away.
The darling girls caught a colt in a peacock, and asked me if I would ride,
and began to ride themselves, when the groom, coming with horrid oaths,
drove them away.
``Lady Crawled is always knitting the worstel. Sir Pitt is always tipsy,
every night; and, I believe, sits with Horrocks, the butler. MIr. Crawled
always reads sermons in the evening; and in the morning is locked up in
his study, or else rides to MIudbury, on county business, or to Squashmore,
where he preaches, on Wednesday and Fridays, to the tenants there.
`' A hundred thousand grateful loves to your dear papa and mamma. Is
your poor brother recovered of his rank-punch? Oh, dear Oh, dear
How men should beware of wicked punch
 Her and over thine own,
ETc.''
Everything considered, I think it is quite as well for our dear Amclia
Sedley, in Trusses Square, that MIss Sharp and she are parted. Rebecca
is a droll funny creature, to be sure: and those descriptions of the poor
lady weeping for the loss of her beauty, and the gentleman ``with lay-
coloured whiskers and straw-coloured hair,'' are very smart, doubtless, and
show a great knowledge of the world. That she might, when on her
knees, have been thinking of something better than Miss IIorroeks's
ribbons, has possibly struck both of us. But my kind reader will place
to remember that these histories in this gaudy yellow covers have
Vanity Fair'' for a title, and that Vanity Fair is a very vain, wicked,
foolish place, full of all sorts of humbugs and Ialsencsses and pretensions.
And while the moralist, who is holding forth on the cover (in aperture
portrait of your humble servant), professed to wear neither gown nor

bands, but only the very same long-eared livery in which his congregation
is arrayed: yet, look you, one is bound to speak the truth as far as one
knows it, whether one mounts a cap and bells or a shovel-hat; and a
deal of disagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an under-
taking.
I have heard a brother of the story-telling trade, at Naples, preaching
to a pack of good-for-nothing honest lazy fellows by the sea-shore, work
himself up into such n rage and passion with some of the villains whose
wicked deeds he was describing and intention, that the audience could not
resist it; and they and the poet together would burst out into a roar of
months and generations against the fictitious monster of the tale, so that the
hat went round, and the bacchic tumbled into it, in the midst of a perfect
storm of sympathy.
At the little Paris theatres, on the other hand, you will not only hear
the people yelling out ``l green / l more /'' and cursing the tyrant
of the play from the boxes; but the actors themselves positively refuse to
play the wicked parts, such as those of lilies english, brutal Cossacks, and
what not, and prefer to appear at a smaller salury, in their real characters
loyal Frenchmen. I set the two stories one against the other, so that you
may see that it is not from mere mercenary motives that the present
performer is desirous to show up and touched his villains; but because he
has a sincere hatred of them, which he cannot keep down, and which must
find a vent in suitable abuse and bad language.
I warn my ``kind friends,'' then, that I am going to tell a story of harrow-
ing villany and complicatel-but, as I trust, intensely interesting-crime.
My rascals are no milk-and-water rascals, I promise you. When we come
to the proper places we won't spare fine language-No, no But when
we are going over the quiet country we must perforce be calm. A
tempest in a slop-sin is absurd. We will reserve that sort of thing for
the mighty ocean and the lonely midnight. The present Number will be
very mild. Others-But i will not anticipate those.
And, as we bring our characters forward, I will ask leaf, as a man and
a brother, not only to introduce them, but occasionally to step down from
the platform, and talk about then : if they are good and kindly, to love
them and shake them by the hand: if they are silly, to laugh at them
confidentially in the reader's sleeve : if they are wicket and heartless, to
abuse them in the strongest terms which politeness amiss of,
Otherwise you might fancy it was I who was sneering at the practice of
devotion, which Miss Sharp finds so ridiculous; that it was I who laughed
good humouredly at the reeling old Silenus of a baronet-whereas the
laughter comes from one who has no reference except for prosperity, and
no eye for anything beyond success. Such people there are living and
flourishing in the world-Faithless, Hopeless, Charityless : let us have at
them, dear friends, with might nd main. Some there are, and very sun-
careful too, mere quacks and fools: and it was to combat and expose such
as those, no doubt, that Laughter was male.

Mr. But Crawled, the rector's wife, refused to visit her, as she said she
would never give the pas to a tradesman's daughter.
As the only endowments with which Nature had gift Lady Crawled
were those of pink cheeks and a white skin, and as she had no sort of
character, nor talents, nor opinions, nor occupations, nor amusements, nor
that vigour of soul and ferocity of temper which often falls to the lot of
entirely foolish women, her hold upon Sir Pitt's anffections was not very
great. Her roses faded out of her cheeks, and the pretty freshness left
her figure after the birth of a couple of children, and she became a mere

This might have been, but for you, a cheery lass :-Peter Butt and Rose a
play an and die, in a snug farm, with a hearty family; and an honest
portion of pleasures, cares, hopes, and struggles. But a title and a coach
and four are toys more precious than happiness in Vanity Fair : and if
Harry the Eighth or Bluebeard were alive now, and wanted a tenth wife,
do you suppose he could not get the prettiest girl that shall be presented
this season
The languid illness of their ma did not, as it may be supposed,
awaken much affection in her little daughters, but they were very happy i
the servants' hall and in the stables; and the Scotch gardener having luekily
a good wife and some good children, they got a little wholesome society
and instruction in his lodge, which was the only education bestowed upon
them until Miss Sharp came.
THeir engagement was owing to the remonstrances of Mr, Pitt Crawled,
the only friend or proteetor Lady Crawled ever had, and the only person,
besides her children, for whom she entertained a little feeble attachment.
Mr. Pitt took after the noble Binkics, from whom he was descended, and
was a very polite and proper gentleman. When he grew to man's estate,
nnl came bsek from Christchurch, he began to reform the slaekened disci-
line of the hall, in spite of his father, who stood in awe of him. He was
 man of such rigid refinement, that he would have starved rather than
have dined without a white neck-cloth. Once, when just from college, and
when HIorroeks the butler brought him a letter without placing it devil-
would on a tray, he gave that domestic a look, and administered to him a
speech so cutting, that IIorrocks ever after trembled before him: the whole
household bowed to him: Lady Crawled's curl-papers came off earlier
when he was at home : Sir it's ruddy sister disappeared; and if that
incorrigible old man still adhered to other old habits, he never fuddled
himself with rum and water in his son's presence, and only talked to lis
ears in a very reserved and polite manner; and those persons remarked
that Sir Pitt never swore at Lady Crawled while his son was in the room.
It was he who taught the butler to say `` My lady is served,'' und who
insisted on handing her ladyship into dinner. DIe seldom spoke to her,
but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let
her quit the apartment, without rising in the most stately manner to open
the door, and making an elegant low at her egress.
At eTon he was called Miss Crawled; and there, I am sorry to say, his
younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently. But though his parts
were not brilliant, he made up for his lack of talent by meritorious industry,

and was never known, during eight years at school, to he subject to that
punishment, which it is generally thought one but a cherub can escape.
At college his career was of course highly crelitable. And here he pre-
spared himself for public life, intowhich he was to be introduced by the patron-
age of lis grandfather, Lord Winnie, by studying the ancient and modern
orators with great assiduity, and by speaking unceasingly at the debating
societies. But though he had a fine flux of words, and delivered his little
voice with great pomposity and pleasure to himself, and never advanced
any sentiment or opinion which was not perfectly trite and stale, mud sup-
parted by a Latin quotation:; yet he failed somehow, in spite of a medi-
society which ought to have insured any man n success. He did not even
get the prize poem, which all his friends said he was sure of.
After leaving college he became Private Secretary to Lord Inside, and
was then appointed Attached to the Legation ut Pupernickel, which post
he filled with perfect honour, and brought home despatches, consisting of
Strasburg pie, to the Foreign Minister of the day. After remaining ten
years Attachc (several years after the lamented Lord Winnie's demise), and
finding the advancement slow, he at length gave up the diplomatic service
in some disgust, and began to turn country gentleman.
He wRote a pamphlets on Malt on returning to England (for he was
an ambitious man, and always like to bE before the public), and took a
strong part in the Negro Emncipation question. Then he became a
friend of MIr. Wilberforee's, whose politics he admired, and had the
famous correspondence with the Revercnd Silas Hornblower, on the
Ashautee Mission. He was in London, if not for the Parliament session,
at least in May, for the religions meetings. In the country he was a
magistrate, and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute
of religious instruction. He was said to be paying his addresses to Lady
Jane Sheepshanks, Lord Southdowu's third laughter, and rose sister,
Lady Emily, wrote those sweet traets, ``The Sailor's True Binnucle,'' and
tHe Applewomn of Finches Common,''
Miss sharp's account of his employment at queen's Crawled were not
caricatures. He subjected the servants there to the devotional exercises
before mentioned, in which (and so much the better) he brought his father
to join. He patronised an independent meeting-house in Crawled parish,
much to the indignation of his uncle the rector, and to the consequent
delight of Sir Pitt, who was induced to go himself once or twice, which
oecusioned some violent scrmons at Crawled parish church, directed point-
blank at the Baronet's old gothic pew there. HOnest Sir Pitt, however,
did not feel the force of these discourses, us he always took lis nap during
sermon-time.
Mr. Crawled was very earnest, for the good of the nation and of the
Christian world, that the old gentleman should yield him up his place in
Parliament ; but this the elder constantly refused to do. bOth were of
course too prudent to give up the fifteen hundred a end which was
brought in by the second seat (at this period filled by MIr. ualroon,
with carte-blanche on the Slave question); indeed the family estate was
much embarrassed, and the income drawn from the borough was of great
use to the house of queen's Sprawly.

AIRY FAIR.
It had never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawled,
first baronet, for revelation in the Type and Sealing Wax Office. Sir
Wulpole was a jolly fellow, eager to seize and to spend money (``alieni
happens, sun profusus,'' as Mr. Crawled would remark with a sigh), and in
his day beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and those-
reality which was maintained at queen's Crawled. The cellars were filled
with burgundy than, the kennels with hounds, and the stables with gallant
hunters; now, such horses as queen's Crawled possessed went to plough,
or ran in the Trafalgar Coach ; and it was with a team of these very
horses, on an off-day, that Miss Sharp was brought to the Hall ; for, poor
as he was, Sir Pitt was a stricken for his dignity while at home, and seldom
drove out but with four horses, and, though he dined off boiled mutton,
had always three footmen to serve it.
If mere parsimony would have made a man rich, Sir Pitt Crawled might
have become very wealthy-if he had been an attorney in a country town,
with no capital but his brains, it is very possible that he would have
turned them to good account, and might have achieve for himself a very
considerable influence and compctency. But he was unluckily endowed
with a good name and a large though encumlered estate, both of which
went rather to injure than to dance him. HE had a taste for law,
which cost him many thousands ycarly; and being a great deal too clever
to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his affairs to
be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all called mistrusted. DIe was
such n sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt
tenants; and such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the
ground, whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she
granted to more liberal lusbantmen. Ill speculated in every possible
wa; he worked mines ; bought canal-shares; horsed conches; took
government contrasts, and was the busiest man and mugistrate of his
county. As he would not pay honest agents at his grauite-quarry, he had
the satisfaction of finding that four overseers ran away, and took fortues
with them to America. For want of proper precautions, his cool-mines
filled with water : the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon
his hands: and for his coach-horses, every mail proprietor in the kingdom
knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country, from under-
feeding and buying cheap. In disposition he was sociable, and far from
being proud; nay, he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a horse-
dealer to that of a gentleman, like my Lord, his son: he was fond
of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was never
known to give away a shilling or to do a good action, but was of a
pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his glass
with a tenant and sell him up the next day; or have his laugh with the
poacher he was transporting with equal good humour. lis politeness for
the fair sex las already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca Sharp-in a word,
the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England, did not contain a
more cunning, men, selfish, foolish, disreputable old man. That blood-
red hand of Sir Pitt Crawled's would be in anybody's pocket except his
own; and it is with grief and pain, that, as admirers of the British
nristocruacy, we find ourselves obliged to admit the existence of so many ill
qualities in a person whose name is in Dearest.
A NoVEL W1ITHOUT A RIVER.

One great cause why Mr. Crawled hal such a roll over the affections
of his father, resulted from money arrangements. The Baronet owed his
son a sum of money out of the moisture of his mother, which he did not
find it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance
to paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to lischargc his
debts. Miss Sharp culculated (for she been, as we shall her speedily,
induced into most of the secrets of the family) that the mere payment of
his creditors cost the honourable baronet several hundreds ycarly; but
this was a delight he could not forego ; he had a savage pleasure in making
the poor wretches wait, and in shiftiug from court to court mud from term
to her the period of satisfaction. What's the good of being in parliament,
he said, if you must pay your debts Hence, indeed, his position as a
seaton was not a little useful to him

state. He was high shceriff, und rode in a golden coney. Great ministers
and statesmen courted him; and in Vanity lair he had a higher place the
the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue.
Sir Pitt had an unmarried half-sister who inherited her mother's large for-
tune, and though the Baronet proposed to borrow this money of her on mort-
gage, Miss Crawled declined the offer, and preferred the security of the
funds. She had signified, however, her intention of leaving her inheritanes
between Sir Pitt's second son and the family at the rectory, and mad once
or twice paid the debts of Shadow Crawled in his career at college and
in the army. Miss Crawled was, in consequence, an object of great respect
when she came to queen's Crawled, for she had a balance at her banker's
which would have made her beloved anywhere.

So she wisely determined to render her position with the queen's
Crawled family comfortable and secure, and to this end resolved to make
friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her
comfort.
As my Lady Crawled was not one of these personages, nd n woman,
moreover, so indolent nd void of character as not to be of the last conse-

With the young people, whose applause she thoroughly gained, her

much learning, but, on the contrary, let them have their own way in regard
to counting themselves; for what instruction is more effectual than self-

as it were, in playing, to impart a great deal of instruction to Miss Rose
Crawled.
She and Miss Rose thus rend together any delightful French and
English works, along which may be mentioned those of the learned Dr.
Collett, of the ingenious MIr. MIsery Finding, ol the ;grave and fantastic
Monsieur Crbillon the yoger, whom r immortal poet Gray so much
admired, and of the universal Monsieur de Yolairc. Once, when Mr.

own skill in speaking the French language, (for he was of the world still),
and not a little pleased with the compliments which the governess point-
really paid him upon hifieney.
Miss Yiolet's tastes were, ch the contrary, more rude and boisterous
than those of her sister.- She knew the seuestered spots where the hens

his speech at the uashimaboo-All Society; took an interest in his
pamphlets on malt; was often affected, even to tears, by his discourses of
an evening, and would say-`' Oh, thank you, sir,'' with a sigh, and a
look up to heaven, that made him occasionally condescend to shake hands
with her. :Blood is everything, after all,'' would that aristoeratic
religions any.  How Miss Sharp is awakened by my words, when not
one of the people here is touched. I am too fine for them-too delicate.
I must familiarise my style-but she understands it. Her mother was as
Montmorency.''
Indeed it was from this famous family, as it appears, that Miss Sharp,
by the mother's side, was descended. Of course she did not say that her
mother had been on the stage; it would have shocked Mr, Crawled's
religious scruples. How many noble empire had this horrid revolution
plunged in poverty She had several stories about her ancestors ere she
had been many months in the house; some of which MIr. Crawled had-
opened to find in D'IIozier's dictionary, which was in the library, and
which strengthened his belief in their truth, and in the light-breeding ol
Rebecca. Are we to suppose from this curiosity and prying into fiction-
cries, could our heroine suppose that Mr. Crawled was interested in her -
no, only in a friendly way. Have we not stated that he was attached to
Lady Jane Sheephanks:
He took Rebeeca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at
backgammon with Sir Pitt, saying that it was a godless amusement, and
that she would be much better engaged in reading `` Thrump's Legaey,''
or  The Blind Wuasherwoman of Moorfelds,'' or any work of a more
serious nature; but Miss hrp sir he lear mother used often te p
the same game with the old Court de Tristram and the venerable Abb du
Corner, and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusement.
But it was not only by playing at backgammon with the Baronet, that
the little governess rendered herself agreeable to her employer. She
found many different was of being useful to him. She real over, with
indefatigable patience, all those law papers, with which, before she came to
queen's Crawled, he had promised to entertain her. She volunteered to
copy any of his letters, and adroitly altered the spelling of them so as
to suit the usages of the present day. She became interested in every-
thing appertaining to the estate, to the farm, the park, the garden, and
the stables; and so delightful a companion was she, that the Baronet
would seldom take his after-breakfast walk without her (and the children
of course), when she would give her advice as to the trees which were to be
lapped in the shrubberies, the garden-beds to be dug, the crops which
were to be cut, the horses which were to go to cart or plough. Before
she had been a year at Queen's Crawled she had quite won the Baronet's
confidence ; and the conversation at the dinner-table, which before used to
be held between him and Mr, Horrocks the butler, was now almost cloud-
lively between Sir Pitt and Miss Sharp. She was almost mistress of the
house wlien Mr. Crawled was absent, but conducted herself in her new and
exalted situation with such circumspeetion and modesty as not to offend the
authorities of the kitchen and stable, among whom her behaviour was
always exceedingly modest and affable. She was quite a different person

from the haughty, shy, dissatisfied little girl whom we have known prey-
house, and this change of temper proved great prudenee, a sincere desire of
amusement, or at any rate great moral courage on her part. WHether it
was the heart which dictated this new system of compliance and humility
adopted by our Rebecca, is to be proved by her after-history. A system
of hypocrisy, which lasts through whole years, is one seldom satisfaetorily
practised by a person of one-and-twenty ; however, our readers will recol-
left, that, though young in years, our heroine was all in life and experience,
and we have written to no purpose if they have not discovered that she
was a very clever woman.
1he elder and younger son of the house of Crawled were, like the gentle-
man and lady in the weather-box, never at home together-they hated each
other cordially: indeed, Rawdon Crawled, the dragoon, had a great con-
tempt for the establishment altogether, and seldom came thither except
when his aunt paid her annunl visit.
The great good quality of this old lady has been mentioned. She post-
passed seventy thousand pounds, and had almost adopted Rawlon. She
disliked her elder nephew exceedingly, and despised him as a milksop.
In return he did not hesitate to state that her soul was irretrievably lost,
and was of opinion that his brother's chance in the next world was not a
whit better.  She is a godless woman of the world,'' would Mr. Crawled
say; ``she lives with atheists and Frenclimen. My mind shoulders when I
think of her awful, awful situation, and that, near as she is to the grave, she
should be so given up to vanity, licentiousness, profaneness, and folly.'' In
fact, the old lady declined altogether to hear his hour's lecture of an even-
in; and when she came to queen's Crawled alone, he was obliged to
pretermit his usual devotional exercises.
`` Shut up your sarmons, Pitt, when Miss Crawled comes down,'' said
his father; ``she has written to say that she won't stand the preachifying.''
 O, sir consider the servants,''
 The servants be hanged,'' said Sir Pitt; and his son thought even
worse would happen were they deprived of the benefit of his instruction.
 By, hang it, Pitt.'' said the father to his remonstrance. You
wouldn't be such a flat as to let three thousand a year go out of the
family ?'
e What is money compared to our souls, sir%'' continued Crawled.
 You mean that the old lady won't leave the money to you ''-and
who knows but it as Mr. Crawled's meaning %
Old Miss Crawled was certainly one of the reprobate. She had a snug
little house in Park Lane, and, as she ate and drank a great deal too much
during the season in London, she went to Harrowgate or Cheltenhum for
the summer. She was the most hospitable and jovial of all vestals, and
had been a beauty in her day, she said. (All old women were beauties one
we very well no.) She was a let esprit, and n dreadful Radical for
those days. She had been in France (where St. Just, they say, inspired
her with an unfortunate passion), and loved, ever after, french novels,
French cookery, and french wines. She read voltaire, and had Rousseau
by heart; talked very lightly about divorce, and most energeticnlly of the
rights of women. She had pictures of Mr. Fox in every room in the

house: when that statesman was in opposition, I am not sure that she
had not flung a man with him; and when he came into office, she took
great credit for bringing over to him Sir Pitt and his colleague for queen's
Crawled, although Sir Pitt would have come over himself, without any
trouble on the honest lady's part. It is needless to say that Sir Pitt was
brought to change his views after the death of the great Whig statesman.
This worthy old lady took a fancy to Rawdon Crawled when a boy,
sent him to Cambridge (in opposition to his brother ant Oxford), and, when
the young man was requested by the authorities of the first-named Univer-
pity to quit after a residence of two years, she bought him his commissions
in the Life Guards Green.
A perfect and celebrated ``look,'' or dndy about town, was this
young officer. Boxing, rat-hunting, the lives' court, and four-in-hand
driving were then the fashion of our British aristocracy; and he was an
adept in all these noble sciences. And though he belonged to the house-
hold troops, who, as it was their duty to rally round the Prince Regent,
had not shown their vulour in foreign service yet, Rawlon Crawled had
already (proof of play, of which he was immoderately fond) fought three
bloody duels, in which he gave ample proofs of his contempt for death.
And for what follows after death,'' would Mr. Crawled observe,
throwing his gooseberry-coloured eyes up to the ceiling. He was always
thinking of his brother's soul, or of the souls of those who differed with
him in opinion: it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give
themselves.
Silly, romantic Miss Crawled, far from being horrified at the courage
of her favourite, always used to pay his debts after his duels; and would
not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality. : He will
sow his wild-oats,'' she would,say, '` and is worth far more than that puling
hypocrisy of a brother of his,''

Crawled was a tall,
stately, jolly, slovel-
hated man, far more
popular in his county than the Baronet lis brother. At college he pulled
stroke-oar in the Christchurch boat, and had thrashed all the best bruisers
of the ``town.'' He carried is taste for boxing an athletic exercises
into private life: there was not a fight within twenty miles at which ll
was not present, nor a race, nor a coursing match, nor a great, nor
a ball, nor an election, nor a visitation dinner, nor indeed a good dinner
in the whole county, but he found means to attend it. you might see
his bay-mare and gig-lamps a score of miles away from his Rectory house,
whenever there was any dinnerparty at Muddleton, or at Irony, or nt
Wapshot Hell, or at the great lords of the county, with all of whom he
was intimate. DIe had a fine voice; sang `` A southern wind and a cloudy
sky;'' and give the `'whoop'' in chorus with general applause. He rode
to hounds in a pepper-and-salt frock, and was one of the best fishermen
in the county.
Mrs. Crawled, the rector's wife, was a smart little body, who wrote this
worthy divine's sermons. Being of a domestic turn, and keeping the
house a great deal with her daughters, she ruled absolutely within the
rectory, wisely giving her husband full liberty without. He was welcome
to come and go, and dine abroad as many days as his fancy dictatcd, for
Mrs. Crawled was a saving woman and knew the price of port wine.

was of a good family, daughter of the late Lieut.-Colonel Sheet MaeTavish,
and she and her mother played for But and won him at Hlarrogate), she

vcr, he was always in debt. It took him at least ten years to pay of

his college bills contraeted during his father's life time. In the year 170-,
when he was just clear of these incumbrnnces, he gave the odds of
100 to 1 (in teniers) against Kangaroo, who won the Derby. The
rector was obliged to take up the money at a ruinous interest, and had
been struggling her since. Ilis sister helped him with a hundred now
and then, but of course his great hope was in her death-when `hang
it' (as he would say), `Mention not leave me half her money.'
So that the Baronet and his brother had every reason which two
brothers possibly can have for being by the ears. Sir Pitt he had the
better of But in innumerable family transactions. Young TPitt not only

woman, it was know, was to come in for the bulk of MIss Crawl's
properly. These money transuctions-these speculautions in life and
death-those silent battles for reversionary spoil-make brothers very
loving towards each other in Vanity Fair. I, for my part, have known
a five-pound-note to interpose and knock up a half century's attaclunecut
between two brethren; and can't but admire, as I think what a face and
purple thing Love is among worldly people.
it cannot be supposed that the arrival of such a personage as Rebecca
at ucen's Crawled, and her gradual establishment in the good graces of
all people there, could be remarked by Mrs. But Crawled. Ms. But,
who knew how many days the smiling of beef lasted ut the Hall; how
much linen was got ready at the great wash; how many peaches were on
the south wall; how many does her ladyship took when she was ill-for
such points are matters of intense interest to certain persons in the
country-MRs. But, I say, could not pass over the Dull governess
without making every inquiry respecting her history and character. There
was always the best understanding between the servants at the Rectory
and the Hall. There was always a good glass of name in the kitchen of lie
former place for the WIll people, whose ordinary drink was very small-
and, indeed, the Rector's lady knew exactly how much mnlt went to every
barrel of ALl beer-times of relnationship existed between the MIll and
Rectory domestic, as between their masters; and through these channels
each fly was perfectly well acquainted with the doings of the other.
That, by the way, may be set down as a general remark. When you and
your brother are friends, his doings are indifferent to you. When you
have quarrelled, all his outgoings and incomings you know, as if you
were his spy.
Very soon then after her arrival, Release began to take a regular place in
Mrs. Crawled's bulletin from the HAll. It was to this effect :-``The black
porker's killed-weighed  stone-salted the sides-pig's pudding and
leg of work for dinner. Mr. Crop, from Mudbury, over with Sir Pitt
about putting Oh Blackmore in gnol-Mr. it at meeting (with all the
ages of the people who attended)--my lady as usual-the young ladies
with the governess.''
Then the report would come-the new governess be a rare manager-
Sir Pitt be very sweet on her-Mr, Crawled too--ll be reading trcts to
her-What an abandoned wretch.'' said little, eager, active, black-faced
Mrs. But Crawled.

ANY 1AIR.
Finally, the reports were that the governess had `'` come round''
everybody, wrote Sir Pitt's letters, did his business, managed his
accounts-hal the upper hand of the whole lose, my lady, MIr. Crossly,
the girls and all-at which Mrs. Crawled declared she was an artful
house, and had some dreadful designs in view. Thus te doings at the
Hall were the great fool for conversation at the Rectory, and MRs. lBute's
bright eyes speed out everything that took place in the enemy's camp-
everything and a great deal besides.

 Presenting my respectful compliments to Indy Muddleton, I have
the honour (epistolarily) to introduce to her ladyship my two friends, Miss
Stuff and Miss IIawky.
 Either of these young ladies is per/they gualifel to distrust in Greek,
Latin, and the judgments of IIecbrew; in mathematics and history; in
Spanish, French, Italian, and geegrply; in music, veal and struck-
mental ; in dancing, without the aid of n master; and in the elements of
natural sciences. In the use of the globes both are proficients. In
addition to these, Miss Stuff, who is daughter of the late several
Thomas Stuff, (Fellow of Corpus College, Cumbrilge,) can instruet in the
Syrian language, and the elements of Constitutional law. But as she is
only eighteen years of age, and of exceedingly pleasing personal appearance,
perhaps this young lady may be objectionable in Sir Hudlleston Found
son's family.
Miss Lucetta Hawk, on the other hand, is not personally well-favoured.
She is twenty-nine; her face is much fitted with the small-box. She has
n halt in her gait, red hair, and a trifling obliquity of vision. Both
ladies are endowed with every oral all religions virtue. Their terms, of
course, are such as their accomplishments merit. With my most grateful

P.S. The Miss Sharp, whom you mention as governess to Sir Pitt
Crawled, Part., M.P,, was a pupil of mine, and I have nothing to say in
her disfavour. Though her appearance is disagreeable, we cannot control
the operations of nature: and though her parents were disreputable (her
father being a painter, several times bankrupt; and her mother, as I have
since learned, with horror, a dance at the Opera); yet her talents are con-
miserable, and I cannot regret that I received lcr out of charity. My
dread is, lest the principles of the mother-who was represented to me as
a French Countess, forced to emigrate in the late revolutionary horrors;
but who, as lL have since found, was a person of the eery lost order and
morals-should at any time prove to be Hereditary in the unhappy young
woman whom I took as an outcast. But her principles have bitter been

and whether the beasts thrice well upon mangelwurzel? Every day since
I last wrote has been like its neighbour. Before breakfast, a walk with Sir
Pitt and his spun; after breakfast, studies (such as they are) in the
school-room; after school-room, reading and writing about lawyers, leaves,
coal-mines, canals, with Sir Pitt (whose secretary I am become); after
dinner, Mr. Crawled's discourses or the baronet's backgammon; during both
of which amusements my lady looks on with equal placidity. She has
become rather more interest by being ailing of late, which has brought
a new visitor to the Hall, in the person of a young doctor. Well, my
dear, young women need never despair. The young doctor gave a certain
friend of yours to understand that, if she chose to he Mrs. Slumber, she

gilt pestle and mortar was quite ornament enough; as if I was born,
indeed, to be a country surgeon's wife. Mr. Slumber went home seriously
indisposed at his rebuft, took a cooling draught, and is now quite cured.
Sir Pitt applauded my resolution highly; he would be sorry to lose his
little secretary, I think; and I believe the old wretch likes me as much as
it is in his nature to like any one. Marry, indeed and with a country
apotheeary, after-No, no, one cannot so soon forget old associations,
about which I will talk no more. Let us return to HIumdrum WIll.
 For some time past it is Humdrum Hall no longer. My dear, Miss
Crawled has arrived with her fat horses, fat servants, fat spaniel-the
great rich Miss Crawled, with serenity thousand pounds in the five per
cents., whom, or I had better say lies, her two brothers adore. She
looks very apopleetic, the dear soul; no wonder her brothers are anxious
about her. You should see them struggling to settle her cushions, or to
hand her coffee. When I come into the country,' she says (for she has a
great deal of humour),'I leave my told, Miss rings, at home. MY
brothers are my towards here, my dear, and a pretty pair they are.'
 WHen she comes into the country our Hall is thrown open, and for a
month, at least, you would fancy old Sir Walpole was come to life again.
We have dinner-parties, and die out in the coach-and-four-the foot-
men put on their nest canary-coloured liveries; we drink claret and
champagne as if we were accustomed to it every day. We have wax
candles in the school-room, and fires to warm ourselves with. Lady
Crawled is made to put on the brightest pen-grace in her wardrobe, and
y pupils leave off their thick shoes and tight old strain plisses, and
wear silk stockings and muslin frocks, as fushionable baronets' daughters
should. Rose and in yesterday in a sal plight-the Wiltshire sow (n
enormous pet of her) ran her down, and destroyed n most lovely flowered
lilac silk dress by dancing over it-had this happened a week ago, Sir
Pitt would anne sworn frightfully, have bowed the poor wretch's cnrs, and
put her upon bread and water for a month. All he said was, T'Il sere
you out, Miss, when your aunt's gone,' and laughed off the accident as
quite trivial. Let us hope his or:to will have passed away before MIss
Crawled's departure. I hope so, for Miss Rose's sake, I am sure. What

mean the baronet and the rector, not oar brothers-but the former, who
hate each other all the year round, become quite loving at Christmas. I wrote
to you last year how the abominable horse-racing rector was in the habit
of preaehing clumsy sermons at us at church, and how Sir Pitt snored in
answer-when Miss Crawled arrives there is no such thing as quarrelling
heard of-the Hall visits the Rectory, and since over-the parson and the
baronet talk about the pigs and the poachers, and the county business,
in the most affable manner, and without quarrelling in their cups, I believe
-indeed Miss Crawled won't hear of their quarrelling, and vows that she
will leave her money to the Shropshire Crawled if they offend her. If.
they were clever people those Shropshire Crawled they might have it all,
I think ; but the Shropshire Care is a clergyman like lis Hampslire
cousin, and mortally offended Miss Crawled (who had fled thither in a fit
of rage against her impracticable brethren) by some strait-laced notions
of morality. HO would have prayers in the house, I believe.
 Our sermon-books are shut up whan Mrs Crawled arrives, and Mr.
Pitt, whom she abominable, finds it convenient to go to tow. On the
other hand, the young. dundy, good, I believe, is the term, Curtain Draw-
lay makes his appearance, and I suppose you would like to know what
sort of a person he is.
wEll, he is a very large young and. He is six feet high, and
speaks with a great voice; and swears a great deal; and orders about the
servant, who all adore him nevertheless; for he is very generous of his
money, and the domestic will do anything for him. Last week the
keepers almost killed n bniliff and his man who came down from London
to arrest the Captain, and who were found lurkiug about the Park wall-
they beat them, ducked them, and were going to shoot them for poachers,
but the baronet interfered.
 The Captain has a hearty contempt for his father, I can see, and calls
him an old put, an old uol, an old la-afon, and merciless other
pretty names. He has a dreadful reputation among the ladies. He
brings his hunters home with him, lives with the Squires of the county,
asks whom he pleases to dinner, and Sir lPitt dares not say no, for fear
of offending Miss Crawled, and missing lis legacy when she dies of her
apoplexy. Shall I tell you a compliment the Captain did me I must,
it is so pretty. One evening we actually lad a dance; there was Sir
Hndlleston muddleton and his family, Sir Gives Wapshot and his young
ladies, and I don't know how many more. Well, I heard him say-' By
jove, she 's a neat little fully1' meaning your humble servant; and he did
me the honour to dance two country-dances with me. He- gets on pretty
gaily with the young Squires, with whom he drinks, best, rides and talks
about hunting and shooting; but he says the country girls are loves,;
indeed, I don't think he is far wrong. YOu should see the contempt with
which they look down on poor me When they dance I sit and play
the piano very demurely ; but the other night coming in rather flushed
from the dining-room, and seeing me employed in this way, he swore out
long that I was the best danced in the room, and took a great oath that
he would have the fildlers from Mulbury.

 Here they are. 'Tis the very image of them. Aieu, adieu1''
When Mrs. But Crawled (whose sacrifice our ingenious Rebecca had
so soon discovered) had procured from Miss Sharp the promise of a visit,
she induced the all-powerful Miss Crawled to make the necessary applied-
lion to Sir Pitt, and the good-naturel old lady, who loved to be gay her-
self, and to see eery one gay and happy round about her, was quite
charmed, and ready to establish a reconciliation and intimacy between her
two brothers. It was therefore agreed that the young people of both

families should visit each other frequently for the future, and the friend-
ship of course lasted as long as the jovial old mediatrix was there to keep
the peace.
wHy did you ask that scoundrel, Ardour Crawled, to dine'' said the
Rector to his lady, as they were walking home through the park. Don't
want the fellow. He looks down upon us country people as so many
blaekamoors. He's never content unless he gets my yellow-sealed wine,
which costs me ten shillings a bottle, hang him? Besides, he's such an
infernal character-he 's a gambler-he's a drunkard-he's a profligate
in every way. DIe's killed a man in a duel-he's over head and ears in
debt, and he's robbed me and mine of the best part of Miss Crawled's
fortune. Way says she has him ''-here the Rector shook his fist but the
moon, with something very like an oath, and added, in a melancholious
tone-''-, down in her will for fifty thousand; and there won't be aboc
thirty to divide.''
I think she's going,'' said the Rector's wife. `She was very red in
the face when we left dinner. I was obliged to place her.''
`She drank seven glasses of champagne,'' said the reverend gentleman,
in a low voice; ``und filtly champagne it is, too, that my brother poisons
us with-but you women never know what's what.''
Me know nothing,'' said MRs. But Crawled.
``She drank every-brandy after dinner,'' continued his Reverence,
'` and took church with her coffee. I wouldn't take a glass for a five-
pound note: it kills me with heart-burn. She can't stand it, Mrs.
Crawled-she must go-flesh and blood won't bear it and I lay five to
two, Mntilda drops in a year.''
Indulging in these solemn speculations, and thinking about his debts,
and his son Jim at College, and Frank at Woolwvich, and the four girls,
who were no beauties, poor things, and would not have a penny but what
they got from the aunt's expected legacy, the Rector and his lady walked
on for a while.
 Pitt can't be such an infernal villain as to sell tlc revulsion of the
living. And that Metholist milksop of an eldest son looks to Pnrliu-
ment,'' continued Mr. Crawled, after a pause.
S Pitt Crawled will do anything,'' said the lleetor's wife.  In

 Pitt will promise anything,'' replied the brother. ` He promised
he 'd pay my college bills, when my father died : he promised he'd build
the new wing to the Rectory: he promised e'd let me have Jibb's field
and the Six-acre Meadow-and much he executed his promises And
it's to this man's son-this scoundrcl, gambler, swindler, murderer of
a selldon Crawled that Until leaves the bulk of her money. I say it's
un-Christian. By Jove, it is. The infamous dog has got every vice
except hypocrisy, and that belongs to his brother.''
`Hush, my dearest loel we 're in Sir Pitt's grounds,'' interposed lis
wife.

and as for the women, why, you heard that before me, in my own magic-

``For Heaven's sake, Mr. Crawled,'' said the lady, ``spare me the
details.''
`And you ask this villain into your house l'' continued the exssperated
Rector. `` You, the mother of a young family-the wife of a clergyman of
the Church of England. By Jove1
 But Crawled, you are a fool,'' said the Rector's wife, scornfully.
 Well, Ma'am, fool or not-and I don't say, Martha, 1'm so clever as
you are, I never did. But I won't meet Brandon Crawled, that's fat.
I'll go over to Hudlleston, that I will, and see his black greyhound, MRs.

or against any dog in England. But I won't meet that beast Rawdon

Mr. Crawled, you are intoxsicnted, as usual,'' replied his wife. And
the next morning, when the Rector woke, and called for small beer, she
put him in mind of his promise to visit. Sir Muddleton Muddleton, on
saturday, and as he knew he should have a et night, it was recall
that he might gullop back again in time for church on Sunday morning.
Thus it will be seen that the parishioners of Crawled were equally happy
in their squire and in their rector.
Miss Crawled had not long been established at the Hall before became's
faecinations had won the heart of that good-natured London rake, as they
had of the country innocent whom we have been describing. taking her
accustomed drive, one day, she thought fit to order that ` that little gover-
ness'' should accompany her to Mudbury. Before they had returned
Rebecca had made a conquest of her; having made her laugh four times,
and amused her during the whole of the little journey.
 Not let Miss Sharp dine t table'' said she to Sir Pitt, who had
arranged a dinner of ceremony, and asked all the neighbouring baronets.
 My dear creature, do you suppose I can talk about the nursery with
LAdy muddleton, or discuss justice' business with that goose, old Sir
Gives Wapshot? I insist upon Miss Sharp appearing. Let Lady Crawled
remain up stairs, if there is no room. But little Miss Sharp Why,
she 's the only person fit to talk to in the county''
Of course, after such a peremptory order as this, Miss Sharp, the
governess, received commands to dine with the illustrious company below
stairs. And when Sir Muddleton had, with great pomp and ceremony,
handed Miss Morley into dinner, and was preparing to take his place by
her side, the old lady cried out, in a shrill voice. Been Sharp Miss
harpl Come ee and sit by me and amuse me: and let Sir kluddleston
sit by Lady Wapshot.''
When the parties were over, and the carriages had rolled away, the ins-
table Miss Crawled would say, ``Come to my dressing-room, Every, and
let s abuse the company,''-which, between them, this pair of friends
did perfectly. Old Sir Muddleton wheezed a great deal at dinner; Sir
Gives Wapshot had a particularly noisy manner of fibbing his soup, and

admiration; as well as the particulars of the night's conversation; the
politics; the war; the quarter-sessions; the famous run with the H. H.,
and those heavy and dreary themes, about which country gentlemen
converse. As for the Misses Wapshots' toilettes and Lady Muddleton's
famous yellow hat, Miss Sharp tore them to tatters, to the infinite amuse-
ment of her audience.
 My dear, you are a perfect trouble,'' Miss Crawled would say. I
wish you could come to me in London, but I couldn't make a butt of you
as I do of poor Brings,-no, no, you little sly creature ; you are too clever
-Isn't she, Firin?''
Mrs. Firkin (who was dressing the very small remnant of hair which
remained on Miss Crawled's pale), flung up her head and said, ` I think
Miss i very clever,'' with the most killing sarcastic air. In fact, Mrs.
Firkin hnl that natural jealousy which is one of the main principles of every

After rcbuffing Sir IIuddlcston Muddleton, Miss Crawled ordered that
London Curacy should lead her into dinner every day, and that Beck
should follow with her cushion-or else she would have Beck's arm and
Rawson with the pillow.  We must sit together,'' she said. : We're
the only three Christians in the county, my love''-in which case, it must
be confessed, that religion was at a very low ebb in the county of Hnnts.
Besides being such a fine religious, Miss Craven was, as we have said,
in Ultra-liberal in opinions and always took occasion to express these in

brother Pitt; look at the Huddlestons, who had been here since Henry
II., look at poor But at the parsonage ;-are any one of them equal to you
in intelligence or breeding?' Equal to do-they are not been equal to
poor dear Brings, my companion, or Bowls, my butler. You, my love,
are a little paragon-positively a little jewel-of hae more brains than
half the shire-if merit had its reward, you ought to be a Duchess-no,
there ought to be no duchesses at all-but you ought to have no superior,
and I consider you, my love, as my equal in every respect; and-will you
put some coals on the fire, my dear; and will you pick this dress of mine,
and alter it, you who can do it so well2'' So this old philanthropist used
to make her equal run of her errands, execute her millinery, and read her to
sleep with French novels, every night.
At this time, as some old readers my recollect, the genteel world had
been thrown into a considerable state of excitement, by to events, which,
as the papers say, might give employment to gentlemen of the long robe.
Ensign Station hal run away with Lady Barbara Fitzurse, the Earl of
Brain's daughter and desires ; and poor Were Vane, a gentleman who, up
to forty, had maintained a most respectable character and reared a
numerous Family, suddenly and outrageously left his home, for the sake of
Mrs. Rougemont, the actress, who was sixty-five years of age.

Miss Crawled said.  He went to the deuce for a woman. There must
be good in a man who will do that. I adore all imprudent matces.-

`Is he very clever'' became asked.
 Clear, my love?-not an idea in the world beyond his horses, and
his regiment, and his hunting, and his play; but he must succeed-he's
so delightfully wicked. Don't you know he has killed a man, and shot an
injured father through the hat only' le 's adored in his regiment; and
all the young men at Water's and the Cool Tree swear by him.
WHen Miss Rebccea Sharp wrote to her beloved friend the account of
the little bell at men's Crawled, and the manner in which, for the first
time, Captain Crawled, had distinguished her, she did not, strange to
related, gie an altogether accurate account of the transaction. The Captain
had distinguished her a great number of times before. The Captain had
met her in a half-score of walks. he Captain hal lightly upon her in
half-hundred of corridors and passages. The Captain had hung over her
piano twenty times of an evening, as (My Lady was now up stairs, being
ill, and nobody heedcd her) she sang. The Captain had written her notes
(the best that the great blundering dragoon could devise and spell; but
dulness gets on as well as any other quality with women). But when he
put the first of the notes into the lives of the song she was singing, the
little governess, rising and looking him steadily in the face, took up the
triangular missive daintily, and waved it about as if it were a locked hat,
and she, advancing to the enemy topped the note into the fire, and
made him a very low course, and went back to her place, and began to
sing away again more merrily than ever,
 What's that?'' said Miss Crawled, interrupted in her after-dinner
love by the stoppage of the music.
iT's a false note,'' Miss Sharp said, with a laugh; and Rawson
Crawled fumed with rage and mortification.
Seeing the evident partiality of Miss Crawled for the new governess,
how good it was of Mrs. use Crawled not to be jealous, and to welcome
the young lady to the Rectory, and not only her, but don Crawled,

over to Crawled parsonage-whither Miss Crawled came too; and as their
mamma was ill, why not the children with Miss Sharp? So the children
(little dears ) came with Miss Sharp; and of an evening some of the party
would walk back together. Not Miss Crawled-she preferred her car-
rage-but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little park
wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the cheekered avenue to
queen's Crawled, was charming in the moonlight to two such lovers of
the picturesque as the Captain and Miss Rebecca.
O those stars, those stars'' Miss Rebecca would say, turning her
twinkling green eyes up towards them. I feel myself almost a spirit
when I gaze upon them,''
O-ah-Gad-yes, so do I exactly, Miss Sharp,'' the other enth-
says replied.  You don't mind my cigar, do you, Miss Sharp'' Miss
Sharp loved the smell of a cigar out of doors beyond everything in the
world-and she just tasted one too, in the pretticst way possible, and gave
a little puff, and a little scream, and a little giggle, und restored the deli-
cacy to the Captain; who tired his moustache, and straightway pufed
it into a blaze that glowed quite red in the dark plantation, and swore-

E must now take leave of Marsala, and
those amiable people practising the rural
virtues there, und travel back to London,
to inquire what has become of Miss Clear.
 We don't care a fig for her,'' writes
some unknown correspondent with a pretty
little hand-writing and n pink seal to her
note. '' She is ,face and insipid,'' and
adds some more kind remarks in this strain,
which I should never hae repeated at all,
but that they are in truth prodigiously come-
plimentary to the young lady whom they
concern.
IIas the beloved reader, in his experience
of society, ever heard similar remarks by
good-natured female friends; who always
wonder what you can see in Miss Smith that
is so fascinating; or what could induce Major
Ones to propose for the silly insignificant
simpering Miss Thompson, who has nothing but her wax-doll face to
recommend her What is there in a pair of pink cheeks and blue eyes
forsooth ?' these dear Moralists ask, and hint wisely that the giFts of genius,
the accomplishments of the mind, the mastery of Mantegna's questions,
and a ladylike knowledge of botany and geology, the knackof making
poetry, the power of rattling sonnets in the Herz-manner, and so forth, are
Far more valuable endowments for n female, than those fugitive charms
which as few years will inevitably tarnish. It is quite edifying to hear
omen speculate upon the worthlessncss and the duration of beauty.
But though virtue is a much finer thing, and those haplcss creatures
ho suffer under the misfortune of good looks ought to be continually put
in mind of the fate which awaits them; and though, very likely, the choice
female character which ladies admire is a ore glorious and beautiful
object than the kind, fresh, smiling, artless, tender little domestic goless,
whom men are inclined to worship-yet the latter and inferior sort of
women must have this consolation-that the men do admire them after all;
and that, in spite of all our kind friends' warning and protests, we go on
in our desperate error and folly, and shall to the end of the chapter.
Indeed, for my own part, though I have been repeatedly told by persons
for whom I have the greatest respect, that MIss Brown is an insignificant

Bulk was not a word to say for herself; yet I know that I have had the
most delightful conversations with Mrs. BLack (of course, my dear Madam,
they are insiolable): I see all the men in a cluster round Mrs. White's
chair : all the young fellows battling to dance with MIss brown: and so
I am tempted to think that to be despised by her sex is a very great come-
pliment to a woman.
Tlc young ladies in Amelia's society did this for her very satisfaclorily.
FOr instance, there was scarcely any point upon which the Miss Osbornes,
Score's sisters, and the Meslemoisellces Doing agreed so well as in their
estimate of her very trifling merits : and their wonder that their brothers
could in any charms in her.  WE are kind to her,'' the Misses Borne
said, a pair of fine black-browed young ladies who had had the best of
governcsses, masters, and milliners; and they treated her with such
extreme kindness and condescension, and patronise her so insufferably,
that the pir little thing as in fact perfectly dumb in their presence, and
to all outward appearance as stupid as they thought her. She made
efforts to like the, as in duty bound, and as sisters of her future husband.
She passed ``long mornings'' with them-the most dreary and serious of
forenoons. She drove out solemnly in their great family coach with them,
nnl MIss W it their governess, that run-bone Vestal. They took her to
the ancient concerts by way of a treat, and to the orator, and to St.
all's to see the charity children, where, in such terror was she of her
friends, she almost did not dare be affected by the hymn the children sang.
Their house was uncomfortable; their papa's table rich and handsome ; their
society solemn and genteel; their self-respect prodigious; they had the
best pew at the Bounding; all their habits were pompous and orderly,
and all their amusements intolerably dull and odorous. After every one
of her visits (and O how glad she was when they whenever l) Miss Borne
and MIss Maria Osbomne, and Miss Wit, the vestal governess, asked each
other with increased wonder, What could George find in that creature P''

sacrifice he was making, and his romantic generosity in throwing himself
away upon hmelia, that I 'm not sure but that he really thought he was
one of the most deserving characters in the British army, and gave himself
up to be loved with a good deal of easy resignation.
Somehow, although he left me very morning, as was stated, and
dined abroad six days in the week, when his sister believed the infatuated
youth to be at Miss Self's apron-strings: e was not always with Amelia,
whilst the world supposed him at her feet. Certain it is that on or
occasions than one, when Captain Daring called to look for his friend,
MIss Borne (who was very attentive to the Captain, and anxious to hear
his military stories, and to know about the health of his dear INnate),
Miss Borne would laughingly point to the opposite side of the square,
and say, `` Oh, you must go to the Hedley's to ask for George; ce never
see hiin from morning till night.'' At which kind of speech the Curtain
would laugh in rather an absurd constrained manner, and turn of the con-
sensation, like an consummate mnu of the world, to some topic of general
interest, such as the Opera, the l'prince's lasst ball at Scarlet Ilouse, or
the weather-that blessing to society
 What an innocent it is, that act of yours,'' Miss Maria would then
say to Miss Jane, upon the Captain's departure. ` Did you see how he
blushed at the mention of poor George on duty ?''
It's a pity Frederic Bulloek hadn't some of his poetry, Miaria,''
replies the elder sister, with a toss of her lead.

In your frock, he, he How could he Can't he landing with
Amelina ?'
The fact is, when Captain Doing blushes so, and looked so awkward,
he remembered a circumstance of which he did not think it was necessary
to inform the young ladies, viz. that he had been calling at MIr. Shelley's
house already, on the pretence of seeing George, of course, and George
wasn't there, only poor little Amelia, with rather a sal wistful face, seated
near the drawing-room window, who, after some very trifling stupid talk,
ventured to ask, was there any truth in the report that the regiment was
soon to be ordered abroad; and had Captain Doing seen Mr. Soprano
that day 
The regiment was not ordered abroad as yet: ad Captain Doing had
not seen George.  He was with his sister, most likely,'' the Capin sail.
` Should he go and fetch the truant?'' So she gave him her land kindly
and gratefully: and he crossed the square; and she waited and waited,
but George never came.
Poor little tender heart and so it goes on hoping and beating, and
longing and trusting. you see it is not much of a life to describe. There is
not much of what you call incident in it. Only one feeling all day-when
will he come? only one thought to sleep and wake upon. I believe George
was playing billiards with Captain Cunnon in Swallow Street at the time
when Amelia was asking Captain Doing about him; for he was a jolly
sociable fellow, and excellent in all games of skill.

Once, after three days of absence, Miss Amelia put on her bonnet, and
actually invaded the Borne house. WHat leave our brother to come
to us'' said the young ladies.  Have you had a quarrel, AmeliaP Do
tell us'' No, indeed, there had been no quarrel. e Who could quarrel
with him,'' says she, with her eyes filled with tears. 9he only came over
to- to see her dear friends ; they had not met for so long. And this
day she was so perfectly stupid and awkward, that the Miss Oabornes
and their governess, who stared after her as she went sadly away, wondered
more than ever what George could see in poor little Amelia.

Of course they did. How was she to bare that timid little heart for
the inspection of those young ladies with their bold black eyes It was
best that it should shrink and hide itself. I know the Miss Osbornes

I warrant you the changes did not escape the two intelligent young
women before mentioned. But there are things, look you, of n fiuer
texture than fur or satin, and all Solomon's glories, and all the wardrobe
of the Green of She ;-things whereof the beauty cscapes the eyes of
any couoisseurs. And there are sweet molest little souls on which you
light, fragrant and blooming tenderly in quiet shady places; in there
are garden-oruaments, as big s brass warming-pins, that are fit to stare
the sun itself out of countenance. Miss Sedley was not of the sun-flower
sort; and I say it is out of the rules of all proportion to draw a violet of
the side of a double delay,
No, indeed; the life of a good young girl who is in the patcrnal nest
as yet, can't have many of those thrilling incidents to which the heroine of
romance commonly lays claim. Snnres or shot may take off the old bird
foraging without-hawk may be abroad, from which they escape or by
whom they suffer; but the young ones in the nest have a pretty comfortable
nnromantic sort of existence in the down and the straw, till it comes to
their turn, too, to get on the wing. While MErcy Sharp was on her own
wing in the country, hoping of all sorts of twigs, and amid a multiplieity
of traps, and pecking up her food quite harmless and successful, Amelia
lay sang in her home of Russet Square; if she went into the world, it was
under the guidance of the elders; nor did it seem that any evil could hold
her or that opulent cheery comfortable home in which she was affection-
lately sheltered. MAmma had her morning duties, and her daily drive, and
that delightful round of visits and shopping which forms the amusements,
or the profession as you may call it, of the rich London lady. lap con-
dusted his mysterious operations in the city-a stirring place in those
days, when war was raging all over europe, and cmpires were being
staked; when the `` Courier'' newspaper hut tens of thousands of sun-
scribers; when one day brought you n battle of Vittoria, another a burning
of Moscow, or a newsman's horn blowing down usscll Snare about
dinner-time announced such a fact as-'`little of ILeipsic-six hundred
thousand men engaged-total defeat of the French-two hundred thousand
killed.'' Old Sedley once or twice came home with a very grave face; and
no wonder, when such news as this was agitating all the hearts and all the
Stocks of Europe.
MEanwhile matters went on in Trusses Square, Bloomsbury, just as if
matters in europe were not in the least disorgnnised. The retreat from
Leipsic made no difference in the number of meals Mr. About took in the
servant's hall ; the allies poured into France, and the dinner-bell rang at
five o'clock just as usual. Don't think poor Amelin cared anything about
Grinned and Montmirail, or was fairly interested in the war until the
application of the Emperor; when she clapped her hands and said prayers,-
oh, how grateful and flung herself into George Borne's arms with all
her soul, to the astonishment of every body who witnessed that ebullition
of sentiment. The fact is, peace was declared, Europe was going to be at
rest; the Coursing was overthrown, and Lieutenant Borne's regiment
would not be ordered on service. That was the way in which Miss
Anelia reasoned. The fate of Europe was Lieutenant George Borne to
her. His dangers being over, she sang Te Deum. He was her Europe:

her emperor : her allied monarchs an august prince regent. In was her

at the MAnsion ViCious, given to the sovereigns, were especially in honour
of George Borne.
We have talked of shift, selF, and poverty, as those dismal instructors
under whom poor Miss Bessy Sharp got her education. Now, love was
Miss Amelia Sedley's last tutoress, and it was amazing what progress our
young lady made under that popular teacher. In the course of fifteen
or eighteen months' daily and constant attention to this eminent finishing
governess, what a deal of secrets Amelia lcurunel, which Miss Wit and the
black-eyed young ladies over the way, which old Miss Insertion of Chiswick
herself, had no cognizance of As, indeed, how should any of those prim

of the question: I would not dare to breathe such an idea regarding them.
Miss Mnaria Borne, it is true, was ``attached'' to MIr, Frederic August

respectable attachment, and she would have taken pulled fSenior, just the

some clariot, and two prodigious tall horses and footmen, and a fourth of
the annual profits of the eminent firm of IIulkr & Bulloek, all of which
atdvantages were represented in the person of Frederic August. Had
orange blossoms been invented then (those touching cmblems of female
purity imparted by us from FRance, where people's daughters are univer-
sally sold in marriage), Miss MIaria, I say, would have assume the spotless
wreath, and stepped into the travelling carriage by the side of gouty, old,
and-headed, bottle-nosed Bulloek Senior; and devoted her beautiful
existence to his happiness with perfect modesty,-only the old gentleman
was married already; so she bestowed her young affections on the junior
partner. Sweet, blooming, orange flowers the other day i saw Miss
Trotter (that was), arrayed in them, trip into the travelling carriage at St.

This was not the sort of love that finished ellen's education; and in
the course of n year turned a good young girl into a good young woman-
to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come. 1This
young person (perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to encourage
her, and act her in such idolatry an silly romantic ideas) loved, with all
her heart, the young officer in his Majesty's service with whom we have
made a brief uequaintanec. She thought about him the very first moment
on waking; and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers.
She never had seen a man so beautiful or so clever: such a figure on

with her when she was married, and gave Lnura a great deal of inform-
lion regarding the passion of love, which must have been singularly useful

regulated rid.
What were her parents doing, not to keep this little heart from bonting
so fast Old Sedley did not seem much to notice matters. Iloe was
grave of late, and his City affairs absorbed him. Mrs. Softly was of so
easy and inquisitive a nature, that slc wasn't even jealous. Mr. Joy.
was away, being besiged by an Irish widow at Cheltenham. Aelia hal
the house to herself-he too since to herself sometimes-not that she
ever doubted; for, to be sure, George must be at the IIorsc-(winds; and
he can't always get leave from Chatham; and he must see his friends and
sisters, and mingle in society when in town (he such an oruient to every
society ) ; and when he is with the regiment, he is too tired to write long
letters. I know where she kept that packet she had-and end steal in
and out of her chair like Iaehimo-like Iahimo? No-that is a bad
part. I will only act Moonshine, and pceep harmless into the bed where
faith and beauty and innocence lie dreaming.
But if Borne's were short and soldicrlike letters, it must be confessed,
that were MIss Sedley's letters to MIr. Borne to be published, we should
have to extend this novel to such a multiplicity of volumes as not the most
sentimental reader could support; that she not only filled sheets of large
paper, but crossed them with the most nstonishing pervcrsencss; that she
wrote whole pages out of poetry-books without the least pity; that she
underlined words and passages with quite a frantic emphasis; and, in fine,
gave the usual tokens of her condition. She wasn't a heroine. all letters
were full of repetition. She wrote rather doubtful gerard sometimes,
and in her verses took all sorts of liberties with the mere. But oh, yes-
names, if you are not allowed to touch the hurt sometimes in spite of
syntax, and are not to be loved until you all know the lillference between

Stubbles and Sooner thought that to be a ``regular Don Giosanni by
Jove'' was one of the finest qualities n man could possess; and Borne's
reputation was prodigious amongst the young men of the regiment. He
was famous in field-sorts, famous at a song, famous on parade; free with
his money, which was bountifully supplied by his father. His coats were
better made than any man's in the regiment, and he had more of them.
DIe was adored by the men. He could drink more than any officer of the

leaving lis young admirers and friends to invent and arrange their whole
story.
And the real state of the case would never have been known at all in the
regiment but for Captain Doing's indiscretion. THe Captain was eating
his breakfast one day in the miss-room, while Cackle, the assistant-surgeon,
and the two above-named worthies were specculating upon Borne's intrigue
-Stubbles holding out that the lady was n Duehess about been Chur-
lotte's court, nnl Cackle owing she was an opera-singer of the worst
reputation. At this idea Doing became so moved, that though his
mouth was full of egg and bread-and-butter at the time, and though he
ought not to have spoken at all, yet he couldn't help blurting out, `` Cnckle,
you're a stupid fool. You 're always talking nonsense and scandal.
Shone is not going to run off with a Duchess or ruin a milliner. Mias
Sedley s one of the most charming young women that ever lived. He'a
been engaged to her ever so long; and the man who calls her names had
better not do so in my hearing.'' With which, turning exceedingly red,
Doing ceased speaking, and almost choked himself with cup of tea. The
story was over the regiment in half-an-hour; and that very evening Mrs.
MIajor O'Down wrote off to her sister Glorvina at O'bDowdstown not to
hurry from During,-young Borne being prematurely engaged already.
She complimented the Lieutenant in an appropriate speech over a glass
of whisky-today that evening, and he went home perfectly furious to
quarrel with Doings, (who had declined Mrs. Major O'Down's party, and
put in his own room playing the flute, and, I believe, writing poetry in a
very melancholy manner)-to quarrel with Doing for betraying his secret.
 Who the deuce asked you to talk about my affairs,'' Osborue shouted
indignantly. ``Why the devil is all the regiment to know that I am going
to be married Why is that tattling old harridan, Perry O'Down, to
make free with my name over her d-d supper-table, and advertise my
engagement over the three kingdom After all, what right have you to
say i am engaged, or to meddle in my business at all, Doing 2''
It seems to e,''- Captain Doing began.
`Seems be hanged, Doing,'' his junior interrupted him. :I am
under obligations to you, I know it, a d-d deal too well too; but I won't
be always sermonised by you because you're five years my senior. I'm
hanged if I 'll stand your airs of superiority and infernal pity and patron-
ge. Pity and puatronagel I should like to know in what I'm your

 What right have you to ask me that question, sir I should like to
an:ow,'' George said.

vANITY FAIR.
Good God, you don't mean to say you want to break off'' asked
Doing, starting up.
``In other words, you ask me if I 'm a man of honour,'' said Borne,
fiercely ; `` is that what you mean You've adopted such a tone regarding
me lately that I 'm - if I'll bear it any more.''
e WHat have I done I 've told you you were neglecling a sweet girl,
George. I 've told you that when you go to town you ought to go to her,
and not to the gambling-houses about St. James's.''
You want your money back, I suppose,'' said George, with a sneer.
Of course 1do-I always did, didn't I'' says Doing.  you speak
like s generous fellow,''
No, and it, William, I beg your pardon''-here George interposed
in a fit of remorse; ``you Have been my friend in a hundred ways,
Heaven knows. you've got me out of a score of scraps. WHich

done but for you: I know I should. bUt you wouldn't deal so hardly
with me; you shouldn't be always catechizing me. I am very fond of
Amclia; I adore her, and that sort of thing. Don't look angry. She's,
faultless; I know she is. But you see there's no fun in winning a thing
less you play for it. THing it: the regiment's just back from the West
Unless, I must have a little thing, and then when I'm married I 'll reform;
I will upon my honour, now. And-I say-Do-don't be angry with
me, and I'll give you a hundred next mouth, when I know my father will
stand something handsome; and I'll ask llearytop for leave, and I 'll go
to town, and see Amclia to-morrow-there now, will that satisfy you''
 It'is impossible to be long angry with you, George,'' said the good-
natured Captain; ``and as for the money, old of, you know if I wanted
it you'd share your last shilling with me.''
That I would, by Jove, being,'' George said, with the greatest gone-
rosity, though by the way he never had any money to spare.
`Only I wish you had sown those wild oats of yours, George. If you
could use seen poor little MIss Emmy's face when she asked me about
you the other day, you would have pitcled those billiard-balls to the deuce.
Go and comfort her, you rascal. Go and write her a long letter. dO
something to make her happy: a very little will.''
I believe she's d-d font of me,'' the Lieutenant said, with a self-
satisfied air; and went off to finish the evening with some jolly closes in
the mess-room.
Amcelia meanwhile, in RusscllSquare, was looking at the moon, which was
shining upon that peaceful spot, as well as upon the square of the Chatham
barraeks, were Lieutenant Osborue was quartered, and thinking to her-
self low her leroy was employed. Perhaps he is visiting the sentries,
thought she; perhaps he is bivouacking; perhaps he is attending the
couch of a wounded comrade, or studying the art of war up in his own de-
solace chamber. and her kind thoughts sped away as if they were angels
and had wings, and flying down the river to Chatlam and Rochestcr, stove
to peep into the barracks where George was.
All things considered, I think it was as well the gates were shut, and
tlc country allowed no one to pass; so that the poor little white-robes angel

could not hear the songs those young fellows were roaring over the whiskey-
punch.
The day after the little conversation at Chatham barraeks, young
Borne, to show that he would be as good as his word, prepared to go
to town, thereby lingering Captain Doing's applause. `I should have
liked to make her a little present,'' Borne said to his friend in confi-
dance, ``one I am quite out of cash until my father tips up.'' But
Doing would not allow this good nature and generosity to be balked, and
. so accommodated Mr. Borne with a few pound notes, which the latter
took after a little faint seruple.
And I dare say he would have bought something very handsome for
Amelia; only, getting off the coach in Fleet Street, he was attracted by a
handsome shirt-pin in a jeweller's window, which he could not resist; and
having paid for that, had very little money to spare for indulging in any
further exercise of kindness. Never mind: you may be sure it was not his
presents Amelia wanted. When he came to Brussels Square, her face
lighted up as if he had been sunshine. The little cares, fears, tears, timid
misgivings, sleepless fancies of I don't know how many days and nights,
were forgotten, under one moment's influence of that familiar, irresistible

smile. He leaned on her from the drawing-room door-magnificent,
with ambrosial whiskers, like a god. About, whose face as he announced
Captain Being (having conferred a brevet rank on that young officer)
blazed with a sympathetic grin, saw the little girl start, and flush, and
limp up from her watching-place in the window; and Snow retreated:
and as soon as the door was shut, she went fluttering to Licutenant George
Borne's heart as if it was the only natural home for her to nestled in.
Oh, thou poor panting little soul The very finest tree in the whole
forest, with the straightest stem, and the strongest arms, and the thickets
foliage, wherein you choose to build and too, may be marked, for what
you know, and may be down with a crash ere long. WHat an old, old
simile that is, between man and timber l
In the meanwhile, george kissed her very kindly on her forehead and
glistening eyes, and was very gracious and good; and she thought His
diamond shirt-pin (which she had not known him to wear before) the poet-
test ornament ever seen.
The observant reader, who has marked our young Lieutennnt's previous
behaviour, and has preserved our report of the brief conversation which he
has just had with Captain Doing, his possibly come to certain colour-
signs regarding the character of Mr. Borne. Some cynical Frenchman
has said that there are two parties to a love-transaction: the one who loves
and the other who condescend to be so treated. Perhaps the love is
occasionally on the man's side: perhaps on the lady's. Perhaps some
infatuated swain has ere this mistaken insensibility for modesty, dulness
for maiden-reserve, mere vacuity for sweet bashfulness, and a goose, in n
word, for a swan. Perhaps some beloved female subscriber has arrayed an
ass in the splendour and glory of her imagination ; admired his dulness
as manly simplicity; worshipped his selfishness is manly superiority;
treated his stupidity as majestic gravity, and used him as the brilliant
fairy Titania in a certain weaker of Athens. I think I have seen such
melodies of errors going on in the world. But this is certain, that Amelia
believe her lover to be one of the most gallant and brilliant men in the
empire: and it is possible Licutenant Borne thought so too.
He was a little will: how many young men are; and do't girls like
a rake better than a milksop He hadn't sown his wild oats as yet, but
he would soon: and quit the army, now that peace was proclaimed; the
Coursing mouster locked up at Elba; promotion by consequence over; and
no chance left for the display of his undoubtedly military talents and vulour:
and his allowance, with AMerican's settlement, would enable them to take a
snug place in the country somewhere, in a good sporting neighbourhood;
no he would hunt a little, and farm n little; no they would be very
happy. As for remaining in the army as a married man, that was impos-
sible. Fnny Mrs. George Shone in lodgings in a country town;
or, worse still, in the East or West Indeed, with a society of soldiers,
and patronise by MRs. Major O'Down: Amelia die with laughing at
Borne's stories about MRs. Major O'Down. DIe loel her much to
fondly to subject her to the horrid woman and her vulgaritics, and the
rough treatment of a soldier's wife. 1le didn't care for himself-not he;

A NOEL WITHOUT A HERO.
109
but his dear little girl should take the place in society to which as his wife
she was entitled: and to these proposals you may be sure she acceded, as
she would to any other from the same author.
Holding this kind of conversation, and building numberless castles in
the air (which Amelia adorned with all sorts of flower-gardens, rustic
walks, country churches, sunday schools, and the like; while George had
his mind's eye directed to the stables, the kennel, and the cellar), this
young pair passed away a couple of hours very pleasantly; and as the
Lieutenant and only that single day in town, and a great deal of most
important business to transact, it was proposed that Miss Emmy should
line with her future sisters-in-law. This invitation was accepted joyfully.
In conducted her to his sisters; where he left her talking and prattling in
a way that astonished those ladies, who thought that George might make
something of her; and then went off to transact his business.
In a word, went on and at its at a pastry-cook's shop in Charing
Cross; trieraew coat in-Pall Mall; dropped in at the Old 9daughter',
and called.for Captain Cannot played clever games at billiards with the
Captain, of which he won eight,and returned to Brussels Square half-an-
hour late for dinner, but in very good humour.
It was not so with old Mr. Borne. When that gentleman came from
the city, and was welcomed in the drawing-room by his daughter and the
elegant Miss Wit, they saw at once 'he his face-which was puffy, solemn,
nd yellow at the best of times-and by the scowl and twitching of his
black eye-brows, that the heart within his large white waistcoat was
disturbed and uneasy.  When Amelia stepped forward to salute him,
which she' always did with great trembling and timidity, he gave
surly grunt of recognition, and dropped the little hand out of his great
thirst paw without any attempt: to hold it there. Ill looked round
gloomily at his eldest daughter; who, comprehending the meaning of his
look, which asked unmistakeahly,  Why the devil is ale here ?'' said at
0oNce:-
 George is in town, Papa; and has gone to the Horse Guards, and
will be back to dinner,''
O he is, is her I won't haste the dinner kept waiting for line,
Jane :'' with which this worthy man lapsed into his particular chair, and
then the utter silence in his genteel, well-furnished drawing-room, was
only interrupted by the alarmed ticking of the great French clock.
When that chronometer, which was surmounted by a cheerful brass
round of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, tolled five in a hey cathedral tone,
Mr. Borne pulled the bell at his right hand violently, and the butler
rushed up.
 Dinner'' roared Mr. Borne.
mR. George isn't come in, sir,'' interposed the man.
Damn Mr. George, sir. Am I master of the house ReNd''
Mr. Borne scowled. Amelia trembled. A telegraphic communication
of eyes passed between the other three ladies. The obedient bell in to
lower regions began ringing the announcement of the men. The rolling
over, the head of the family thrust his hands into the great tail-pockets of
110

his great blue coat and brass buttons, an without waiting for a further
announcement, strode down stairs alone, scowling over his shoulder at the
four femules.
 What 's the matter now, my dear ?'' asked one of the other, as they
rose and tripped gingerly behind the sire.
I suppose the funds are falling,'' whispered Miss Wit; and so,
trembling and in silence, this hushed female company followed their dark
dealer. They took their places in silence. e growled out a blessing,
which sounded as grufly as a curse. The great silver dish-covers were
removed. Amelia trembled in her place, for she was next to the awful
Scorned, and alone on her side of the table,-the gap being occasioned y
the absence of George.
Soup'' says Mr. Borne, clutching the idle, fixing his eyes on her,
in a sepulchral tone; and having helped her and the rest, did not speak for
a while.
 Take Miss Sedley's plate away,'' at Inst he said. :She can't eat the
soup-no more can I. It's beastly. Take away the soup, STicks, and
to-morrow turn the cook out of the house, Jane,''
Being concluded his observations upon the soup, MIr Borne made a
few curt remarks respecting the fish, also of a savage and satiricnl ten-
deny, and cursed Billingsgate with an emphasis quite worthy of the
place. Then,he lapsed into silence, and swallowed sundry glasses of wine,
looking more and more terrible, till a brisk knock at the door told of
George's arrival, when everybody began to rally.
He could not come before. General Daguilet had kept him waiting at
the Horse Guards. Never mind soup or fish. Give him anything-he
didn't care what. Capital mutton-capital everything.'' His good-
humour contrasted with his father's severity; and he rattled on unless-
ingly during dinner, to the delight of all-of one especially, who need not
be mentioned.
As soon as the young ladies had discussed the orange and the glass of
wine which formed the ordinary conclusion of the dismal banquets at Mr.
Borne's house, the signal to make sail for the drawing-room was given,
and they all arose and departed. Aelia hoped George would soon join
them there. She began playing some of his favourite watches (then newly
informed) at the great carved-legged, leather-cased grand piano in the
drawing-room overhead. This little sacrifice did not bring him. It was
deaf to the waters; they grew fainter and fainter ; the discomfited per-
former left the huge instrument presently; and though her three friends
performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new pieces of their beer-
tore, she did not hear a single note, but sat thinking, nnl bowing evil.
All Borne's scowl, terrified always, had never before looked so deadly to
her. IIi eyes followed her out of the room, as if she had been guilty of
something. WHen they brought her coffee, she started as though it were
a cup of poison which Mr. Cries, the butler, wished to propose to her. What
mystery was there lurking? Oh those women They nurse and cuddle
their presentiments, and make darlings of their ugliness thoughts, as they do
of their deformed children.
The gloom on the paternal countenance had also impressed George

Borne with anxiety. With such eyebrows, and a look so decidedly
bilious, how was he to attract that one from the govemuor, of which
George was consumnedly in want Ill began praising his father's wine.
That was generally a successful means of cajoling the old gentleman.
We never got such Mlaleira in the West Inies, sir, as yours. Colonel
lIeavytop took off three bottles of that you sent me now, under his belt
the other day.''
Did he:'' said the old gentleman. `'It stands me in eight shillings
a bottle,''
 Will you take six guineas a dozen for it, sir'' said George, with
laugh. : There 's one of the greatest men in the kingdom wants some.''
Does he:'' growled the senior.  With he may get it.''
WHen General guilt was at Chatham, sir, Ileavytop gave him a
breakfast, and asked me for some of the wine. The General like it just
s well-wanted s pipe for the Commander-in-Chief. DIe's his loyal
lIighness's right-hand man.''
It is devilish fine wine,'' said the Eyebrows, and they looked ore
good-coloured; and George was going to take advantage of this come-
placencey, and bring the supply question on the mahogauy; when the
father, relapsing into solemnity, though rather cordial in manner, bale him
ring the bell for clret. ``And we 'll see if tlut 's as good as the Smaller,
George, to which his Royal IIighmness is welcome, i 'm sure. And as we
are drinking it, I'll talk to you about a matter of importance.''
Amelia heard the claret bell ringing as she sat nervously a-stairs. She
thought, somehow, it was a mysterious and prcsentimental bell. Of the
presentiments which some people are always having, come surely must
come right.
 What I want to know, George,'' the old gentleman said, after lowly
smacking his first rupert.  What I wnut to know is, how you and-
at-that little thing up-stirs, are carrying on''
I think, sir, it 's not hard to see,'' george said, with a self-satisfied
grin.  Pretty clear, sir.-What capital wine''
 WHat do' you mean, pretty clear, sir''
 Why, change, sir, don't push me too hard. I 'm a molest man. I-
ah-I don't set up to be a lady-killed; but I do own that she 's as devilish
fond of me as she can be. Any body can see that with half an eye.''
``And you yourself2''
 Why, sir, didn't you order me to marry her, nnl ain't I a good boy '
And't our Papa settled it her so long''
`A pretty boy, indeed. IInvhn't I heard of your doings, sir, with
Lord Tarquin, Curtain Crawled of the Guards, the Honourable Mr., Deuceace
and that set. Have a care, sir, have a care.''
The old gentleman pronounced these aristocratic names with the
greatest gust. Whenever he met a great man he grovclled before him,
and m-lorded him as only a free-born Briton can do. HIDe came home
and looked out his history in the Peerage: he introduced his name into his
daily conversation; he bragged about his Lorlship to his daughter. He
fell down prostrate and basked in him as a Nenpelitan beggar does in the
sun. George was alarmed when he heard the names. DIe feared his

father might have been informed of certain transactions at play. But the
old moralist cased him by saying serenely,
 Well, well, young men will be young men. And the comfort to me
is, course, that living in the best society in England, as I hope you do;
as I think you do; as my means will allow you to go-''
 Thank you, sir,'' says George, making his point at once. ' One can't
live with these great folks for nothing; and my purse, sir, look at it;''
and he held up a little token which had been netted by Amelin, and con-
taking the very last of Doing's pound notes.
 You shan't want, sir. The British merchant's son shan't want, sir.
My guineas are as good as theirs George, my boy; and I dont grudge
'em. Call on Mr. Copper as you go through the City to-morrow; he'll
have something for you. I dont grudge money when I know you 'are in
good society, because I know that good society can never go wrong.
There's no pride in me. I was a humbly born man-but you have had
uivntages. Make a good use of 'm. Mix with the young nobility.
There's many of 'em who can't spend a collar to your guinea, my boy.
And as for the pink bonnets (here from under the heavy eyebrows there
came a knowing and not by blessing her)--why less will be boys
Only there's one thing I order you to avoid, which, if you do not, 1'll
cut you off with a shilling, by Joe; and that's gambling, sir.''
`Oh, of course, sir,'' said George.
But to return to the other business about Amelia: why shouldn't you
marry higher than a stockbroker's daughter, George-that's what I want
to know 
 It 's a family business, sir,'' says George, crascking filberts. `You and
MIrK. Sedley made the match a hundred years ago,''
I don't deny it; but people's positions alter, sir. I don't deny that
Sedley made my fortune, or rather put me in the way of acquiring, by my
own talents and genius, that proud position, which, I my say, I occupy in
the tallow trade and the City of London. I've shown my gratitude to
Shelley; and he's tried it of late, sir, as my check-book can show.
Courage I tell you in confidence I don't like the looks of It. Shelley's
sTairs. My chief clock, Mr. Copper, does not like the looks of 'em, and
he's an old file, and knows Change as well as any man in London.
IIulkcr and Bullock are looking shy at im. He's been dabbling on his
own account I fear. `They say the Jeune Amelie was his, which was taken
by the Canker Private Masses. And that 's flat,-unless I see Amelia's
ten thousand down you don't marry her. I'll have no name duck's
daughter in my family. Pass the wine, sir-or ring for coffee.''
WIth which Mr. Borne spread out the evening-poor, and George
knew from this signal that the colloquy was ended, and that his papa was
about to take a nap.
ICe hurried up stairs to Amelia in the highest spirits. WHat was it
that made him more attentive to her on that night than he had been for a
long time-more eager to amuse her, more tender, more brilliant in talk?
WAs it that his generous heart warmed to her at the prospect of misery-
tune; or that the idea of losing the dear little prize made him value it more

afterwards, remembering his words; his looks ; the song he sang; his
attitude, as he leant over her or looked at her from a distance. As it
seemed to her, no night ever passed as quickly at Mr. Borne's house
before; and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry
by the premature arrival of Mr. About with her shawl.
George came and took a tender leave of her the next morning: and
then hurried off to the City, where he visited Mr. Copper, his father's
head man, and received from that gentleman a document which he ex-
changed at Hunger's and Bullock's for a whole pocket-full of money. As
George entered the house, old John Sedley was passing out of the banker's
parlour, looking very dismal. But his london was much too clated to
mark the worthy stockbroker's depression, or the dreary yes which the

BUT this time there rove up to an
exceedingly snug and well appointed
house in Park Lane, a travelling chariot
with a lozenge on the panels, a dis-
contented female in a green veil and
crimped curls on the rumble, and a
large and confidential man on the box.
It was the equipage of our friend Miss
Crawled, returning from Hands. The
windows of the carriage were she;
the fat spaniel, whose head and tongue
ordinarily rolled out of one of them,
repose on the lap of the discontented
female. WHen the vehicle stopped, na large round bundle of shawls was taken
out of the carriage by the aid of various domestic and a young lady who
accompanied the heap of cloaks. That bundle contained Miss Crawled,
who was conveyed up-stairs forthwith, and put into a bed and chamber
warmed properly as for the reception of an invalid. Messengers went off
for her physician and medical man. They came, consulted, prcescribel,
vanished. The dog companion of Miss Crawled, at the conclusion of
their interview, came in to receive their iustructions, and administered
those antiphlogistic medicincs which the eminent men ordered.

despondent : he found Miss Brings her dame do companion in tears alone in

so often smoothed in the hour of sickness. She was denied admission to

IIere these two talked for ten minutes, discussing, no doubt, the same-
tombs of the old invalid above stairs; at the end of which period the
parlour-bell was rung briskly, and answered on that instant by Mr. Bowls,
Miss Crawled's large confidential butler (who, indeed, happened to be at
the keyhole during the most part of the interview); and the Captain coming
out, curling his moustachios, mounted the black charge wing among
the straw to the admiration of the little blackguard boys collected in the
street. He looked in at the dining-room window, managing his horse,
which curvetted and capered beautifully-for one instant the young person
might be seen at the window, then her figure vanished, and, doubtless, she
went-up stairs again to resume the affecting duties of benevolence.
Who could this young woman be, I wonder That evening a little
dinner for to persons was laid in the dining-room-when Mrs. Firkin,
the lady's maid, pushed into her mistress's apartment, and bustle about
tore during the vacancy occasioned by the departure of the new nurse-
and the latter and Miss Brings sat down to beneath little meal.
Brings was so much choked by emotion that she could hardly the n
morsel of ment. The young person carved n for with the utmost
delicacy, and asked so distinctly for egg-sauce, that poor Brings, before
whom that delicious confident was placed, started, made a great clatter-
ing with the lady, and once more fell back in the most gusling hysterical
state.
Hal you not better give Miss Brings a glass of wine2'' and the
person to Mr. Bowls, the large confidentinl man. DIe did so. Brings
seized it mechanically, gasped it down convulsively, moaned a little, and
began to play with the chicken on her plate.
t I think we shall be able to help each other,'' said the person with
great suavity: ``and shall have no need of Mr. Boys's kind services.
MIr. Bowls, if you please, we will ring when we want you.'' He went
don stairs, where, by the way, he vented the most horrid curses upon
the unoffending footman, his subordinate.
It is a pity you take on so, Miss Brings,'' the young lady said, with
cool, slightly sarcastic, air.
 My dearest friend is so ill, and wo-o-o-on't see me,'' gurglcd
out Brings in an agony of renewed grief.
She's not very ill any more. Console yourself, lend MIss Iriggs.
She has only overtaken herself-that is all. She is greatly better. he
will soon be quite restored again. She is weak from being cupid and
from medical treatment, but she will rally immediately. Pray console
yourself, and take a little more wind.''
e ut why, why won't she see me again?'' Miss Brings blcnted out
Oh, Matilda, Mfatilda, after three-and-twenty years' tenderness is this
the return to your poor, poor Arabella?''
Don't cry too much, poor Arabella,'' the other said (with ever so
little of a grin);'' she only won't see you, because she says you don't nurse
her as well as I do. It's no pleasure to me to sit up all night. I wish
you might do it instead.''
 HAve I not tended that ear couch for years:'' Arabella said, `` and

 Now she prefers somebody else. Well, sick people have these fancies,
and must be humoured. When she's well I shall go.''
nEver, never,'' Arabella exclaimed, madly pinching her salts-bottle. .-
Never be well or never go? Miss Brings,'' the other said, with the
same provoking good nature. ``Pooh-she will be well in a fortnight,
when I shall go back to a little pupils at Queen's Crawled, and to their
mother, who is a great deal more sick than our friend. you need not be
jealous about me, my dear Miss Brings. I am a poor little girl without
any friends, or any harm in me. I don't want to supplnt you in Miss
Crawled's good graces. She will forget me a week after I am gone: and
her affection for you has been the work of years. Give me a little wind
if you please, my dear Miss Brings, and let us be friends. I 'm sure I
want friends.''
The parable nd soft-hearted Brings speechlessly pushed out her hand
at this appeal; but she felt the desertion most keenly for all that, and
bitterly, bitterly moaned the fickleness of her Matilda. At the end of
half an hour, the meal over, Miss Rebeeca Sharp (for such, astonishing to
state, is the name of her who has been described ingeniously as the person
hitherto), went up-stairs again to her patient's rooms, from which, with
the most engaging politeness, she eliminated poor Firkin.  Thank you,
Mrs. Firkin, that will quite do: how nicely you make it1 I will ring
when anything is wanted.''  Thank you;'' and Firkin came down stairs
in a tempest of jealousy, only the more dangerous because she was forced
to confide it in her own bosom.
Could it be the tempest which, as she passed the landing of the first
floor, blew open the drawing-room door No; it was stealthily opened
by the hand of Brings. Brings had been on the watch. Brings too well
heard the evening Firkin descend the stairs, and the click of the spoon
and gruel-basin the neglected female carried.
 Well, Firkin'' says she, as the other entered the apartment, eYEiNG,

A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
I
Rebecca passed that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawled; the
next night the old lady slept so comfortably, that Rebeccn had time for
several hours' comfortable repose herself on the sofa, at the foot of her
patroness's bed; very soon, Miss Circle was so well that she sat up
and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Brings and her grief,
which HRebecca described to her. lriggs' weeping baffled, and her manner
of using the handkerchief, were so completely rendered, that Miss Crawled
are quite cheerful, to the admiration of the doctors when they visited
her, who usually found this worthy woman of the world, when the least
sickness attacked her, under the most abject depression and terror of death.
Captain Curled came every day, and received bulletins from Miss
Rebecea respeeting his aunt's health. This improved so rapidly, that
poor bRings was allowed to see her patronuess; and persons with tender
hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female,
and the affecting nature of the interview.
Miss Crawled liked to have Brings in a good deal soon. Rcbccca used
to miic her to her face with the most ndmirable gravity, thereby men-
during the imitation doubly picunnte to her worthy patroness.
The causes which had led to the leplorable illness of Miss Crawled, and
her departure from her brother's house in the country, were of such an
unromantic nature tat they are hardly fit to be explained in this genteel
and sentimental novel. For how is it possible to hint of n delicate female,
living in good society, that she ate and drank too much, and that a hot
supper of lobster profusely enjoyed at the rectory was the reason of an
indisposition which Miss Curled herself persisted as solely attributable
to the dampness of the weather? The attack was so sharp the Mntilda-
as his Reverence expressed it-was very nearly `` off the hooks;'' all the
family was in a fever of expectation regarding the will, and Rawson
Really was making sure of at least forty thousand pounds before the
commencement of the London season. Mr, Crawled sent over a choice
parcel of tracts, to prepare her for the change from Vanity Fair and Park
Lane for another world; but a good doctor from Southampton being
called in in time, vanquished the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her,
nod gave her sufficient strength to enable her to return to London. The
baronet did not disguise his excecding mortification at the turn which
affairs took.
While everybody was attending on Miss Crawled, and messengers every
hour from the allegory were carrying news of her health to the nflectionatc
folks there, there was a lady in another part of the house, being exceedingly
ill, of whom no one took any notice at all; and this was the lady ol
Curled herself. The good doctor shook his head after seeing her; to
which visit Sir Pitt consented, as it would be paid without a few; and she
was left. fading away in her lonely chamber, with no more heed paid to her
than to a weed in the park.
The young ladies, too, lost much of the insatiable benefit of their
governess's instruction. So affectionate n nurse was Miss Sharp, that
Miss Crawled would take her melicines from no other hand. Firkin ha
been deposed long before her mistress's departure from the country. ThaT

PITY FAR.
Faithful attendant found a gloomy consolation on returning to London, in
seeing Miss lriggs suffer the same pangs of jealousy and undergo the same
fithless treatment to which she herself had been subject.
Captain Rawdon got an extension of leave on his aunt's illness, and
remained dutifully at home. He was always in her antichamber. (She lay
sick in the state bed-room, into which you entered by the little blue saloou).
His father was always meeting him there; or if he came down the corridor
ever so quietly, his father's door was sure to open, and the plain face of
the old gentleman to glare out. What was it set one to watch the other
so P A generous rivalry, no doubt, as to which should be most attentive
to the dear suferer in the state bed-room. Rebeeca used to come out
and comfort both of them; or one or the other of them rather. Both of
these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to have news of the invalid
from her little confilential messenger.
At dinner-to which meal she descended for half an hour-she kept the
peace between them: after which she disappeared for the night; when
Rawdon would ride over to the deep0t of the 150th at Yalbury, leaving
his Papa to the society of Mr, Horrocks and his rum and water. She
passed as weary n fortnight as ever mortal spent in Miss Crawled's sick
room; but her little nerves seemed to be of iron, and she was quite
unshaken by the duty and the elysium of the sick-chamber.
She never told until long afterwards how painful that duty was; how
peevish a patient was the jovial old lady ; how angry; how sleepless; in
what horrors of death; during what long nights she lay moaning, and in
almost delirious agonies rcspecting that future world which she quite
ignored when she was in good health,-Picture to yourself, oh fair young
reader, a worldly, selfish, graceless, thaukless, religionless old woman,
writhing in pain and fear, and without her wig. Picture her to yourself,
and are you be old, learn to love and pray
Sharp watched this graeeless bedside with indomitable patience. Nothing
escaped her; and, like a prudent steward, she found a use for everything.
She told many a good story about Miss Crawled's illness in after days,-
stories which made the lady blush through her artificial carnations. During
the illness she was never out of temper; always alert; she slept light,
having a perfectly clear conscience; and could take that refreshment at
almost any minute's warning. And so you saw few traces of fatigue in
her appearance. Her face might be a trifle paler, and the circles round
her eyes a little blacker than usual; but whenever she came out from the
sick-room she was always smiling, fresh, and neat, and looked as trim in
her little dressing-gown and cap, as in her smallest evening suit.
The Captain thought to, and raved about her in uncouth convulsions.
The barbed shaft of love and penetrated his dull hide. Six weeks-happy-
inquiry-opportunity-had victimised him completely. He made a con-
fidunte of his aunt at the Rectory, of all persons in the world. She rallied
him about it; she had perceived his folly ; she warned him; she finished
by owning that little Sharp was the most clever, droll, odd, good-natured,
simple, kindly creature in England. Rawdon must not trifle with her
affection, though-dear Miss Crawled would never pardon him for that;
for she, too, was quite overcome by the little governess, and loved Sharp

He was not very wise; but he was a man about town, and had seen

astonishment at this announcement. He couldn't deny it. IIi father's
evident liking for Miss Sharp had not escaped him. DIe know the old
gentleman's character well; and a more unscrupulous old-whom-he did
not conclude the sentence, but walked home, curling his moustachios, and

When he saw Rebeeca alone, he rallied her about his father's attachment

her clear ringing voice. ` No,'' she continued, kindling as she spoke to

Her feelings gave way, and she burst into tears.

She was gone. She drove out with Miss Crawled that my. It was
before the latter's illness. At dinner she was unusually brilliant and
lively; but she would take no notice of the hints, or the nods, or the
clumsy expostulations of the humiliated, infatuated guardsman. Sir-
meshes of this sort passed perpetually during the little campaign-tedious
to related, and similar in result. The Crawled heavy rivalry was maddened
by defeat, and routed every day.
The baronet of queen's Crawled had not had the fear of losing his sister's
legacy before his eyes, he never would have permitted his dear girls to
lose the educational blessings which their invaluable governess was con-
fearing upon them. The old house at home seemed n desert without her,
so useful and pleasant had Release made herself there. Sir Pitt's letters
were not copied and corrected; his books not made up; his household
business and manifold schemes neglected, now that his little secretary was
away. And it was easy to see how necessary such an amanuensis was to
him, by the tenor nnl spelling of the numerous letters which he sent to
her, entreating her and commanding her to return. Almost every day
brought n frank from the baronet, enclosing the most urgent prayers to
Beck for her return, or conveying pathetic statements to Miss Crawled,
regarding the neglected state of his daughters' education; of which docu-
meets Miss Crawled took very little heed.
Miss bRings was not formally dismissed, but her place as companion
was a sinecure and a derision ; and her company was the fat spaniel in the
drawing-room, or occasionally the discontented Firkin in the housekeeper's
closet. Nor, though the old lady would by no means hear of Rebeecn's
departure, was the latter regularly installed in voice in Park Lane. Like
many wealthy people, it is Miss Crawled's submit to accept as much
service and she could get from her inferiors; and good-naturedly to take
lace of them when she no longer found them useful. Gratitude amongst
certain rich folks i scarcely natural or to be thought of. They take
needy people's services as their due. Nor have you, O poor parasite and

is about as sincere as the return which it usually gets. It is money
you love, and not the man; and were Cresus and his footman to change
places, you know, you poor rogue, who would love the benefit of your
allegiance.
And I am not sure, that, in spite of Rebecca's simplicity and activity,
and gentleness and entering good humour, the shrewd old London lady,
upon whom these treasures of friendship were lavished, had not a lurking
suspicion all the while of her affectionate nure and friend. It must he

If she measured her own feeling towards the world, she must he been
pretty well able to gauge those of the world towards herself; and perhaps
she reflected, that it is the ordinary lot of people to have no friends if they
themselves care for nobody.
Well, meanwhile Beck was the greatest comfort and convenience to
her, and she gave her a couple of new gowns, and an old necklaee and
shawl, and showed her friendship by amusing all her intimate acquaintances
to her new confidante (than which there can't be a more touching proof of
regard), and meditated vaguely some great future benefit-to marry her
perhaps to Clump, the apothecary, or to settle her in some advantageous
way of life; or, at any rate, to send her back to Queen's Crawled when she
had done with her, and the full London season had begun.
When Miss Crawled was convalescent and descended to the drawing-
room, Beck sang to her, and otherwise amused her; when she was
well enough to drive out, lUcky accompanied her. And amongst the
drives which they took, whither, of all places in the world, did Miss
Crawled's admirble good-nature and friendship actually induce her to
penetrate, but to Brussels Square, Bloomsbury, and the house of Joy
edley, Squire.
Ere that event, many notes had passed, as may be imagined, between
the two dear friends. During the months of became's stay in Hnmshire,
the eternal friendship lad (must it be owned) suffered considerable
diminution, and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to threaten
demise altogether. The fact is, both girls had their own real affairs to
think of: llebecca her advance with her employers-Amelia her of
absorbing topic. When the two girls met, and flew into each other's and
with that impetuosity which distinguished the behaviour of young ladies
towards each other, Rebecca pcrformed her part of the embrace with the
most perfect briskness and energy. Poor little Amelia blushed as she
kissed her friend, and thought she had been guilty of something very like
coldness towards her.
Their first interview was but a very short one. Amelia was just ready
to go out for a walk. Miss Circle was waiting in her carriage below,
her people wondering at the locality in which they found themselves, and
gazing upon honest About, the black footman of Bloomsbury, as one of
the queer natives of the place. But when Mmelia came down with her
kind smiling looks (became must introduce her to her friend, Miss Crawled

the protector of her friend.

may be sure, was ready enough to accept it when she heard that George
was to be of the party. It was arranged the Amelia was to sped the
morning with the ladies of Park Lane, where all were very kind to her.
Rebccca patronised her with calm superiority: she was so much the
cleverer of the two, and her friend so gentle and unassuming, that she
lays yielded when anybody chose to command, and so took llcbeccn's
orders with perfect meekness and good humour. Miss Curtly's gracious-
ness was also remarkable. She continued her raptures about little Animal,
talked about her before her face as if she were a doll, or a servant, or a
picture, and admired her with the most bcneolent wonder possible. I
admire that admiration which the genteel world sometimes extends to the
commonly. There is no more agreeable object in life than to see My
Fair folks condescending. Miss Crawled's prodigious benevolence rather
fatigued poor little Mmelia, and I am not sure that of the three ladies in
lark Lane she did not find honest MIss BRidges the most agreeable. She

George came to dinner-a repast end gargon with Captain Crawled.
The great family coach of the Shortest transported him to Park
Lane from Trusser Square; where the young ladies, who were not
themselves invited, and professed the greatest indifference ut that slight,
nevertheless looked at Sir Pitt Crawled's name in the baronctage; nd
learned everything which that work had to teach about the Crawled
family and their pedigree, and the Binkics, their relatives, se., &c.
Rawdon Crawled received George Borne with great frankness and gray-
countess : praised his play at billiurds: asked him when he would have
his revenge: was interested about Shore's regiment: and would have
proposed picture to him that very evening, but MIss Crawled absolutely
forbade any gambling in her house; so that the young Licutenant's
purse was not lightened by his gllant patron, for that day at last.
However, they made an engagement for the next, somewhere: to look at
a horse that Crawled had to sell, and to try him in the dark; and to dine
together, and to pass the evening with some jolly fellows. ``That is, if you 're
not on duty to that pretty Miss Coldly,'' Crawled said, with a knowing
wink.  Monstrous nice girl, 'pon my honour, though, Borne,'' he was
good enough to add. " LOts of tin, I suppose, eh''
Borne wasn't on duty; he would join Crawled with pleasure: and the
latter, when they met the next day, praised his new friends horscinan-
ship-as he might with perfect honesty-and introduced him to three or
four young men of the first fashion, whose acquaintance immensely clated
the simple young officer.
How 's little Miss Sharp, by-the-bye,'' Borne inquire of his friend
over their wine, with a dignified air.  Good-natured little girl that.
Does she suit you well at queen's Crawled Miss Seller liked her a

Captain Morley looked savagely nt the Lieutenaut out of his little blue
eyes, and watched him when he went up to resume his acquaintance with

any jealousy in the bosom of that life-guardsman.

And gave him a little not, so cool and killing, that Rawon Curled,
watching the operations from the other room, could hardly restrain his
laughter as he saw the Lieutenant's entire discomfiture ; the start he knew,
the pause, and the perfect clumsiness with which he at length found-
scene to take the finger which was offered for his embrace.
She 'd best the devil, by Jove'' the Captain said, in a rapture; and
the Lieutennt, by way of beginning the conversation, agreeably asked
Rebcceca how she liked her new place.
My place?'' said Miss Sharp, coolly, ``how kind of you to remind me
of it It's a tolerably good place: the wages are pretty good-not so
good as Miss Wit's, I believe, with your sisters in Trusses Square. How
are those young ladies f-not that I ought to ask.''

Why not'' Mr. Borne said, amazed.
s Why, they never condescended to speak to me, or to ask me into their
house, whilst I was staying with Amelia; but we poor goernesses, you
know, are used to lights of this sort.''
MY dear Miss Sharp l1'' Borne eiaeulated.
eAt least in some families,'' Rebecca continued. : You can't think
what a difference there is though. We are not so wealthy in Hampshire
as you lucky folks of the city. But then I am in a gentleman's family-
good old English stock. I suppose you know Sir Pitt's father refuse a
peerage. And you see how I am treated. I am pretty comfortable.
Indeed, it is rather a good place. But how very good of you to inquire''
Borne was quite savage. The little Governess patronised him and
perished him until this young British Lion felt quite uneasy; nor would he
muster sufficient presence of mind to find n pretext for lacking out of this
most delectable conversation.
e I thought you liked the City families pretty well,'' he said haughtily.
'Last year you mean, when I was fresh from that horrid vulgar school 
Of course I did. Doesn't every girl like to come home for the holidays:
And how was I to know any better But oh, Mr. Borne, what n did-
fierce eighteen months' experience makes-eighteen months spent,
pardon me for saying so, with gentlemen. As for dear Amelin, she, I
grant you, is a pearl, und would be charming anywhere. There now, I
see you are beginning to be in a good humour; but oh these queer old
City people And Mr. Joy.-how is that wonderful Mr. JosephP''
 It seems to me you didn't dislike that wonderful Mr. Joseph last year,''
Borne said kindly.
 How severe of you1 Well, entre nous, I didn't break my heart about
him ; yet if he had asked me to do what you mean by your looks (and very
expressive and kind they are, too), I wouldn't have said no.''
Mr. Borne gave a look as much as to say, ``Indeed, how very
obligingI''
e What an honour to have had you for a brother-in-law, you are think-
ing? To be sister-in-law to George Borne, Squire, son of John
Osborue, squire, son of-what was your grandpap, Mr. Borne

and open; and, considering all things, it was very kind of you to allude
to the circumstance-very kind and polite. Auelia ear, Mr. Borne

Thus was George utterly routed. Not that Rebecca was in the right;
but she had managed most successfully to put him in the wrong. And he
now shameful feel, feeling if he stayed another minute, that he would
have been made to look foolish in the presence of Amelian.
Though Reloccn hal had the better of him, George was above than-

hours were over. They added to her original regard for Mr. Borne.
FAir woman's instinct had told her, that it was George who had interrupted
the success of her first love-passage, audl she esteemed him accordingly.
 I only just warn you,'' he said to Rawdon Crawled, with n knowing
look-he had bought the horse, and lost some score of guineas after dinner,
 I just warn you-I know women, and counsel you to be on the look-out.''
Thank you, my boy,'' said Crawled, with a look of peculiar gratitude.
: You 're wide awake, I see.'' And George went off, thinking Crawled
was quite right.
He told Amelia of what he had done, and how he had counselled Rawdon
Crawled-a devilish good, straight-forward fellow-to be on his guard
against that little sly, charming Rebeecn.
` Against low 2'' Aelia cried.
Your friend the Governess.-Don't look so astonished,''
O George, what lay you done'' Amelia said. For er woman's
eyes, which Love had made sharp-sighted, and in one instant diseoverceda
secret which was invisible to Miss Crawled, to poor virgin Brings, and,
above all, to the stupid peepers of that young whiskered prig, Lieutenant
Borne.
For as Rebccca was showing her in an upper apartment, where these
two friends had an opportunity for a little of that secret talking and con-
spiring which forms the delight of female life, Amelia, coming up to
Rebeeca, and taking her two little hands in hers, said, ``Rehecca, I see
it all.''
Rebeeca kissed her.
And regarding this delightful secret, not one syllable more was said by
either of the young women. But it was destined to come out before long.
Some short period after the above events, and Miss Rebeceea Sharp still
remaining at her patroness's house in Park Lane, one more hntchment
might have been seen in Great Gaunt Street, figuring amongst the many
which usually contact that dismal quarter. It was over Sir Pitt Crawled's
house; but it did not indicated the worthy baronet's demise. It was a
feminine attachment, and indeed a few years back had served as a funeral
compliment to Sir Pitt's old mother, the late danger lady Crawled. Its
period of service over, the attachment had come down from the front of the
house, and lived in retirement somewhere in the back premises of Sir Pitt's
mansion. It re-appeared now for poor Rose Dawson. Sir Pitt was a
widower again. The arms quartered on the shield along with his one were
not, to be sure, poor Rose's. She had no arms. But the clerks painted on
the scutchcon answered as well for her as for Sir Pitt's mother, and Treasury
was written under the coat, flanked by the Crawled Dove and Serpent.

MIr. Crawled had tended that otherwise friendless end-side. She went out
of the world strengthened by such words and comfort as he could give her.
For many years his was the only kindness she ever knew; the only friend-
ship that solace in any way that feeble, lonely soul. Her heart was dead
long before her body. She had sold it to become Sir Pitt Crawled's wife,

Fair.

When the demise took place, her husband was in London attending to
some of his innumerable schemes, and busy with his endless lawyers. DIe
had found time, nevertheless, to call often in Park LAne, and to despatch
many notes to Rebecea, entreating her, enjoying her, commanding her to
return to her young pupils in the country, who were now utterly without
companionship during their mother's illness. But Miss Crawled would
not her of her departure; for though there was no lady of fashion in
London who would desert her friends more complacently as soon as she
was tired of their society, and though few tired of them sooner, yet as long
as her egoiment lasted her attachment was prodigious, and she clung
still with the greatest energy to Rebecea.
The news of Lady Crawled's death provoked no more grief or comment
than might have been expected in Miss Crawled's family circle.  I
suppose I must put off my party for the 3rd,'' MIss Crawled said; and
added, after a pause,``I hope my brother will have the decency not to
marry again.''  What a confounded rage Pitt will been if he does,''
Rawdon remarked, with his usual regard for his elder brother. Rcbeeca
said nothing. She seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the
family. She left the room before Rawdon went away that day; but they
met by chance below, as he was going away after taking leave, and in a
parley together.
On the morrow, as Rebuke was gazing from the window, she startled
Miss Crawled, who was placidly occupied with a French novel, by crying
out in in alarmed tone, ` Here's Sir Pitt, MIa'no.'' and to baronet's
knock followed this announcement.
My dear, i1 can't see him. I won't see him. Tell Bowls not at
home, or go down stairs and say I'm too ill to receive any one. MY
nerves really won't bear my brother at this moment ;'' cried out Miss
Crawled, and resumed the noel.
 She 's too ill to see you, Sir,'' Recent said, tripping down to Sir
Pitt, who was preparing to ascend.
 So much the better,'' Sir Pitt answered.  want to see you, Miss
Beck. Come along a me into the parlour,'' and they entered that apart-
ment together.
I want you back ut queen's Crawled, Miss,'' the baronet said, fixing
his eyes upon her, and taking off his black gloves and his hat with its
great crape hot-band. His eyes all such a strange look, and fixed upon
her so stedfastly, that Rebecca Sharp began almost to tremble.
I hope to come soon,'' she said in a low voice, '"as soon as miss
Crawled is better-and return to-to the dear children,''
 of've said so these three months, Been,'' replied Sir Pitt, ``and
still you go hanging on to my sister, who 'll fling you off like an old shoe,
when she's wore you out. I tell you I want you. I'm going back to
the Funeral. Will you come back? Yes or no.''
I aren't-I don't think-it would be right-to e alone-with you,
Sir,'' Beck said, seeingly in great agitation.

: Married l marriage.'' Rebecea said, in an agony of tears-her voice
choking with emotion, her handkerchief up to her ready eyes, finding
against the mantel-piece-a figure of woe fit to mclt the most obdurnte
heart. O Sir Pitt, dear Sir it, do not think me ungrateful for all your
goodness to me. It is only your generosity that has extorted my secret.''
Generosity be hanged'' Sir Pitt poured out. : Who is it to, then,

Saying which, Rebeeca went down on her knees in a most tragical way,
and, taking Sir Pitt's horny black hand between her own two (which were
very pretty and white, and as soft as satin), looked up in his face with an
expression of exquisite pathos and confidence, when-when the door
opened, and Miss Crawled sailed in.

made her. It was scarcely out of his mouth, when Mrs. Firkin and Miss
hriggs had streamed up the stairs, had rushed into the drawing-room where
Miss Crawled was reading the French novel, and had given that old lady
the astounling intelligence that Sir Pitt was on his knees, proposing to
Miss Sharp. And if you calculate the time for the above dialogue to take
place-the time for Brings and Firkin to fly to the drawing-room-the

exactly accurate this history is, and low Miss Crawled met have appeared
at the very instant when Recent had assumed the attitude of thirty.
' It is the lady on the ground, and not the gentleman,'' Miss Cruelty
said, with a look and voice of great scorn. They told me that you were
on your knees, Sir Pitt : do kneel once more, and let me see this pretty
couple.''
:I hae thanked Sir Pitt Curled, ma'am,'' Rehecca soil, rising, `'and
have told him that-that I never can become Only Crawled,''
Refused him '' Miss Crawled sail, more bewildered the ever.
Brings and Firkin at the door opened the eyes of astonishment and the
lips of wonder.
e Yes-refused,'' ebeccn continued, with a sad, tearful voice.
And am I to credit my ears that you absolutely proposed to her, Sir
I?'' the old lady asked.

And she refused you as she says2 ''
`es,'' Sir Pitt said, his features on a broad grin.
It does not seem to break your heart at any rate,'' MIss Crawled
remarked.
Gnaw a bit,'' answered Sir Pitt, with a coolness and good-humor
which set Miss Crawled almost mad with bewilderment. nt an old men-
tleman of station should fall on his knees to a penniless avenues, and
burst out laughing because she refused to marry him,-that n hopeless
governess should refuse a Baronet with four thousand a year,-these were
mysteries which Miss Crawled could never comprehend. It surassel any
coplications of intrigue in her favourite Painful le Run.
I'm glad you think it good sport, brother,'' she continual, groping
wildly through this amazement.
 Famous,'' said Sir Pitt. wHo' ha' thought it what a sly little
deill what a little for it was1'' he muttered to himself, chuckling with
pleasure.

foot.  Pray, Miss Sharp, are you waiting for the Prince llcgent's

she sank down in a chair so pathetically, that most of the audience present
were perfectly melted with her sadness.

To your friend, mind,'' said Sir Pitt, and putting on his crapce-hound hat,

who would have followed her up-stairs, she went up to her apartment;
while Brings and Mias Crawled, in a high state of excitement, remained to
discuss the strange event, and Firkin, not less moved, dived down into the
kitchen regions, and talked of it with all the male and female company
there. And so impressed was Mrs. Firkin with the news, that she thought
proper to write off by that very night's post, ``' with her humble duly to
Mrs. But Crawled and the family at the Rectory, and Sir Pitt has been and
proposed for to marry Miss Sharp, wherein she las refused him to the
wonder of all,''
The two ladies in the dining-room (where worthy Miss Brings was
delighted to be admitted once more to a confidential conversation with her
patroness) wondered to their hearts' content at Sir Pitt's offer, and llebccca's
refusal; rings very acutely suggesting that there must have been so
obstacle in the shape of a previous attachment, otherwise you oman
in her senses would ever have refused so ndvantageous a proposal.
You would have accepted it yourself, wouldn't you, Brings :'' Miss
Crawled said, kind.
WOuld it not be a privilege to be less Crawled's sister P'' Brings
replied, with meek evasion.
 II, SIckly would have made a good Lady Crawled, after all,'' Miss
Crawled remarked, (who was mollified by the girl's refusal, and very liberal
and generous now there was no call for her sacrilices.) `` She is brains in
plenty (much more it in her little finger than you have my poor dear
rings in all your hell.) Her manners are excellent now l ave formed
her. She is a Montmoreucy, Brings, and blood is something, though I
despise it for my part; and she would have held her own amongst those
pompous stupid IInmpshire people much better than that unfortunate
ironmonger's daughter.''
BRings coincided as usual, and the ``previous attachment'' was then
discussed in conjectures. `of poor friendless creatures nrc always
having some foolish tedre,'' Miss Crawled said. ``You yourself, you
know, were in love with a writing aster (don't cry, rings-you're
always crying, and it won't bring him to life again), and I suppose this
unfortunate Beck has been silly and sentimental too-some apothecary,
or house-steward, or painter, or young curate, or something of that sort.''
Poor thing, poor thing'' says rings (who was thinking of twenty-
four years back, and that hectic young writing master whose lock of
yellow hair, and whose letters, beautiful in their illcgibility, she cherished
in her old desk up stairs.) `Poor thing poor thing.'' says Brings.
Once more she was a fresh-checked lass of eighteen; she was at evening
churel and the hectie writing master and she were quavering out of the
same psalm-book.
 After such conduct on Rlebeeca's part,'' Miss Crawled sail enthusiastic-
ugly, ``our family should do something. Find out who is the whole,
Brings. I'll set him up in a slop; or order my portrait of him, you
know; or speak to my cousin the Bishop-and I'll doter Beck, and we'll
have a wedding, brings, and you shall mukc the breakfast, and be a brides'
maid,''
Brings declared that it would be delightful, and rowed that her dear
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
Miss Crawled was always kind and generous, and went up to Rebececa's
bed-room to console her and prattle about the offer, and the refusal, as
the cause thereof; and to hint at the generous intentions of Miss Crawled,
and to find out who was the gentleman that had the mastery of Miss
Sharp's heart.
Rebecca was very kind, very affectionate and affected-responded to
Brings' offers of tenderness with grateful fervour-owned there was a
secret attachment-a delicious mystery-what a pity Miss bRidges had not
remained half a minute longer at the key-hole Release might, perhaps,
he told more : but five minutes after Miss Brings' arrival in Rebeeca's
apartment, Miss Crawled actually made her appearance there-an unheard
of honour ;-her impatience and overcome her; she could not wait for the
tardy operations of her nmbassadress: so she came in person, and ordered
Brings out of the room. And expressing her approval of Rehecca's con-
dust, she asked particulars of the interview and the previous transactions
which had brought about the astonishing offer of Sir Pitt.
Rebecca said she had long had some notion of the partiality with
which Sir Pitt ouourel her, (for he was in the habit of making his feelings
known in a very frank and unreservcd anne) but, not to mention private
reasons with which she would not for the present trouble Miss Crnwlcy,
Sir Pitt's age, station, and habits were such as to render a marriage quite
impossible ; and could a woman with any feeling of self-respect and any
decency listen to proposals at such a moment, when the funeral of the
lover's decease wife had not actually taken place
 Nonsense, my dear, you would never have refused him had there not
been some one else in the sense,'' Miss Crawled said, coming to her point
at once. : 1tell me the private reasons; what are the private reasons?'

right, dear Lady,'' she said with a sweet simple faltering voice.  on
wonder at one so poor and friendless having an attachment, don't you?
I have never heard that poverty was any safeguard against it. I wish it
were,''
My poor dear child,'' cried Miss Crawled, who was always quite ready
to be sentimental, Is our passion unrequited, the? Are we pining
in secret Tell me all, and let me console you.''
I wish you could, dear Madam,'' Rebecca said in the same tearful
tone. `Indeed, indeed I need it.'' And she laid her head upon Miss
Crawled's shoulder and wept there so naturally that the old lady, surprised
into sympathy, embrace her with an almost maternal kindness, uttered
many soothing protests of regard and affection for her, owed that she
loved her as a daughter, and would to everything in her power to serve
her. And new who is it, my dear Is it that pretty Miss Sedley's
brother? You said something about an affair with him. I'll ask him

But O love me always-promise you will love me always.'' And in the
midst of mutual tears-for the motions of the younger woman had
awakened the sympathies of the elder-this promise was solemnly
given by Miss Crawled, who left her little wrote, blessing and admire-
in her as a dear, artless, tender-hearted, affectionate, incoinpreliensible
creature.
And now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful
events of the day, and of what had been and what might have been.

the privilege of peeping into Miss Amelia Sedley's bed-room, and under-
standing with the omniscience of the novelist all the gentle pains and
passions which were tossing upon that innocent pillow, why should he
not declare himself to be Release's contidunte too, utter of her secrets,
nnl sent-keeper of that young woman's conscience '
Well then, in the first place, Rebeccn gave way to some very sincere
and touching regrets that a piece of marvellous good fortune should have
been so near her, and she actually obliged to decline it. In this natural
emotion every properly regulated mind will certainly share. What good
mother is there that would not commiserate a penniless spinster, who
might have can my lady, and have shared for thousand a year What
well-bred young person is there in all Vanity air, who will not feel for a
hard-working, ingenious, meritorious girl, who gets such an honourable,
advantageots, provoking offer, just at the very moment when it is out of
her power to accept it I am sure our friend lUcky's disappointment
deserves and will command every sympathy.
I remember one night being in the Fair myself, at an evening party.
I observed all Miss only there also present, single out for her special
attentions all flattery little Mrs. Briefless, the barrister's wife, who
is of a good family certainly, but, as we all know, is as poor as poor
can be.
WHat, i1 asked in my own mind, can cause this obsequiousness on the
part of MIss Story; has Brieflcss got a county court, or has his wife had
n fortune left her: Miss Only explained presently, with that simplicity
which distinguished all her conduct. you know, she said, Mrs. Briefless
is graullaughtcr of Sir John Redhand, who is so ill at Cheltenham that
he can't last six months. Mrs. Briefless's papa, succeeds; so you see she
will he a baronet's daughter.' And Today asked Tribeless and his wife to
inner the very next week,
If the mere chance of becoming a baronet's daughter can procure a lady
such homage in the world, surely, surely we may respect the agonies of a
young woman who has lost the opportunity of becoming a baronet's wife.
Who would lay dreamed of Lady Crawled dying so soon? She was
one of those sickly women that might have lasted these ten years-llebesca
thought to herself, in all the woes of repentance-and I might have

box nt the Opera; and I would have been presented next season. All
this it have been; but now-now all was doubt and mystery.
BUt Ilebeeea was a young lady of too much resolution and energy of
character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the
irreroctble past; so, having devoted only the proper portion of regret to
it, she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future, which was
ow vnstly more important to her. And she surveyed her position, and
its hopes, doubts, and cheeks.
In the first place, she was marrial;-that was a great fact. sIr Pitt
knew it., She was not so much surprised into the avowal, as induced to
make it by a sudden cnlculation. it must have come some day; and why
not now as at a later peril He who would have married her himself
must at least be silent with regard to her marriage. BUt how Miss
Crawled would bear the news-was the great question. MIsgivings
Release had; but she remcberel all Miss Crawled hal said; the old
lady's avowed contempt for birth; her daring liberal opinions; her general
romantic propensities; her almost doting attachment to her nephew, and
her repeatedly-expressed fondness for Rcbccca herself. She is so fond of
him, Ilelecea thought, that she will forgive him anything: she is so used
to me that I don't think she could be comfortable without me: when
the lairciassement comes there will be a scene, and hysterics, nd n great
quarrel, and then a great reconciliation. At all events, what use was
there in playing' the die was throw, nnl now or to-morrow the issue
must be the same. And so, resolved that Miss Crawled should have the
news, the young person debatel in her mind as to the best men of
conveying it to her; and whether she should face the storm that must
come, or try and avoid it until its First fury was blown over. In this state
of meditation she wrote the following letter:-
Denrest Friend,-The great crisis which we have debuted about so
often is come. HAlf of my secret is know, and I have thought and
thought, until I am quite sure that now is the time to reveal the whole of

Sir Pitt knows I am married, and not knowing to who, is not very
much displeased as yet. In taste is actually angry that I should have
refused him. But she is all kindness and graciousness. She condescend
to say I would have mile him a good wife; and vows that she will be
mother to your little Rebecca. sHe will be shaken when she first hears
the news. But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger I
think not: I am sure not. She does upon you so (you naughty, good-
for-nothing man), that she would pardon you anything : and, indeed,
I believe, the next place in her heart is mine: and that she would be
miserable without me. dEarest l something tells me we shall conquer.

And I trust there is no reader of this little story who has not discern-
ment enough to perceive that the Miss kEliza Styles (n old schoolfellow,
became said, with whom she had resumed an active correspondence of
late) and who used to fetch these letters from the saddler's, wore brass
spurs, and large curling mustaclios, and was indeed no other than

OW they were married is not of
the slightest consequence to any
body. What is to hinder a Captain
who is a major, and a young lady
who is of age, from purchasing a
license, and uniting themselves at
any church in this town Who
needs to be told, that if a woman
has a will, she will assuredly find
a way ?-MY belief is, that one
day, when Miss Sharp had gone
to pass the forenoon with her
lear friend Miss Amelia Candle,
in Trusses-square, a lady very like
her might have been seen enter-
in a church in the city, in co-
pay with a gentleman with dyed
muastachoes, who, after a quarter
of an hour's interval, escorted her
back to the lackey-coach in
waiting, and that this was a quick
bridal party.
And who on earth, after the daily experience we have, can question the
probability of a gentleman marrying any body HOw many of the wise
all learned have married their cooks? Did not Lord Eldon himself, the
most prudent of men, make a run-away match Were not Achilles and
Ajax both in love with their servant maids And are we to expect a
heavy dragoon with strong desires and small brains, who had never con-
trouble a passion in his life, to become prudent all of a sudden, and to
refuse to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind If
people only made prudent marriages, what a stop to population there
would be
It seems to me, for my part, that Mr. Rawson's marriage was one of
the honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that
gentleman's biography which has to do with the present history. No one
will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman, or, being captiated,
to marry her; and the admiration, the delight, the passion, the wonder,
the unbounded confidence, and frantic adoration with which, by degrees,
this big warrior got to regard the little Rebecea, were feelings which the
ladies at least will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him,

When she sang, eery note thrilled in his dull soul, and single through
his huge arm: When she spoke, le brought  the more r s brains
to listen and wonder. If she was jocular, he used to resolve her jokes in
his mind, and explode over them half an hour afterwards in the street,
to the surprise of the room in the tilbury by his side, or the comrade
riding with him in Rotten Row. Her words were miracle to him, her
smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom. lOw she
sings,-how she points,'' thought he.  How she rode that kicking mare
ant queen's Curled1'' And he would say to her in confidentinl moments,
By Jove, Been, you're fit to be Commander-in-Chief, or Archbishop of
Canterbury, by Jove.'' Is his case a rare one and don't we see every
day in the world many an honest IIereules at the apron-strings of People,
and great whiskered Amongst prostrate in Delilah's up 
When, then, Become told him that the great crisis was near, and the
time for action had arrived, Rawdon expressed himself is ready to act
under her orders, as he would be to charge with his troop at the command
of his colonel. There was no need for him to put his letter into the third
volume of Porteus. Rebecca easily found a means to get rid of bRings,
her companion, and met her faithful friend in '` the usual place'' on the next
day. She had thought over matters at night, and communicated to no-
don the result of her determination. He agreed, of course, to every
thing; was quite sure that it was all right; that what she proposed was
best ; that Miss Crawled would infallibly relent, or ``come round,'' as he
said, after a time. And Relccca's resolutions been entirely different, he
would have followed them as implicitly. : You have had enough for
both of us, Beck,'' said he. ``on're sure to get us out of the scraqe. I
never saw your equal, and I've met with some clippers in my time too,''
And with this simple confession of faith, the love-stricken dragoon left he
to execute lis part of the project which she had formed for the sir.
It consisted simply in the hiring of quiet lodgings at Brompton, or in
the neighbourhood of the barraeks, for Captain and MRs. Crawled. For
Rebecca had determined, and very prudently, we think, to fly. luwlon
was only too happy at her resolve; he had been entreating her to take this
measure any tie for weeks past. 1In praneed off to change the lodgings
with all the impetuosity of love. He grieved to pay two guineas a week so
readily, that the landlady regrettcd she had asked him so little. He
ordered in a piano, and half a nursery house full of flowers, and a heap of
good things. As for shawls, kid gloves, silk stockings, gold French
watches, bracelets and perfumed, he went them in with the profusion of
blind love und unbounded credit. And having relieved his mind by this
outpouring of generosity, he went and dined nervously at the club, waiting
until the great moment of his life should come.
The occurrenees of the previous day; the admirable conduct of Rebecca
in refusing an offer advantageous to her, the secret unhappiness praying
upon her, the sweetness and silence with which she bore her aflliction,
made Miss Crawled much more tender than usual. An event of this
nature, n marriage, or a refusal, or a proposal, thrills through a whole
houseful of women, and sets all their hysterical sypathies at work. As

an observer of human nature, I regularly frequent St. George's, Hanover
Square, during the genteel marriage season; and though I havenescr see
the bridegroom's male friends give way to tears, or the bundles and frolic-
eating clergy any way affected, yet it is not at all uncommon to see women
who are not in the least concerned in the operations going o-old ladies
who are long past marrying, stout middle-aged females with plenty of sons
and daughters, let alone pretty young creatures in pink bonncts, who are
on their promotion, and may naturally take an interest in the ceremony,-I
say it is quite common to see the women present piping, sobbing, unwilling.
hiding their little faces in their little useless pocket-handkerchiefs, and
heaving old and young with emotion. When my friend, the fashionable
John alice, married the lovely Lady Belgravia Green Parkcr, the em-
lion was so general, that even the little snully old pew-opener who let me
into the seat, was in tears. And wherefore? I inquired of my own soul:
she was not going to be married.
Miss Crawled and Brings in a word, after the first of Sir Pitt, indulge
in the utmost luxury of sentiment, and llebeccn became an object of the
most tender interest to then. In her absence Miss Crawled solace her-
self with the most sentimental of the novels in her library. Little Sharp,
with her secret griefs, was the heroine of the day.
let night became sang ore sweetly and talked ore pleasantly than
she had ever been heard to do in Park Lane. She twined herself round
the heart of Miss Crawled. She spoke lightly and laughingly of Sir Pitt's
proposal, ridieuled it as the foolish fancy of an old man; and her eyes filled
with tears, and Brings's heart with unutterable pangs of defeat, as she
said she desired no other lot that to remain for ever with her dear bone-
facetress. `` My dear little creature,'' the old lady said, ' I don't intend to
let you stir for years, that you may depend upon it. As for going back
to that odious brother of mine after what has passed, it is out of the hues-
lion. Were you stay with me and bRings. Brings wants to go to see
her relations very often. b3rings, you ay go when you like. bUt as for
you, my dcur, you must stay and take care of the old woman.''
II london Cruelty had been then and there present, instead of being
at the club nervously drinking claret, the pair might have gone down on
their knees before the old spinster, avowed all, and been forgiven in a
twinkling. But that good chance was denial to the young couple, doubt-
less in order that this story might be written, in which numbers of their
wonderful adventures are narrnted-adventures which could never have
occurred to them if they had been houscd and sheltered under the cow-
fortable interesting forgiveness of Miss Crawled.
Under MRs. Firkin's orders, in the Park Lane establishment, was a young
woman from klnmpshire, whose business it was, among other duties, to
knock at Miss Sharp's door with that jug of hot water, which Firkin
would rather have perished then have presented to the intruder. This
girl, bred on the family estate, had a brother in Captain Crawled's troop,
and if the truth were known, I daresay it would come out that she was
aware of certain arrangements, which have a great deal to do with this
history. At any rate she purchased an yellow shall, a pair of green boots,

and a light blue hat with a red feuther, with three guineas which Rebecca
gave her, and as little Sharp was by no means too liberal with her money,
no doubt it was for services rendered that Betty Mnrtin was so bribed.
On the second day after Sir Pitt Crawled's offer to Miss Sharp, the sun
rose as usual, and at the usual hour Betty Mnartin, the upstairs maid,
knocked at the door of the governess's bed-chamber.
No answer was returned, and she knocked again. Silence was still
uninterrupted ; and City, with the hot water, opened the door and en-
tired the chamber.
he little white dimity be was as smooth and trim as on the day previous
when Betty's own hands had helped to make it. Two little trunks were
corded in one end of the room; and on the table before the window-on
the pincuslion-the great fat pinetshion lined with pink inside, and twilled
like a lady's nightcap-by a letter. -. It had been reposing there probably
all night.
Betty advanced towards it on tiptoe, as if she were afraid to awake it-
looked at it, and round the room with an air of great wonder and satisfy-
lion, took up the letter, and grind intensely as she turned it round and
her, and finally carried it in to Miss Brings's room below.
How could Betty tell that the letter was for Miss Brings, I should like
to know All the schooling Betsy had was at Mrs. But Crawled's Sun-
day School, and she could no more read stRing than Hebrew.
`La, Miss Brings,'' the girl cxselaimel, ' O,miss, something must have
happened-there nobody in Miss Sharp's room; the bed faint been slept
in, and lie've i away, and left this letter for you, Miss.''

hair falling over her shoulders ; '`an elopementl MIss Sharp a fugitive .
What, what is this'' and she eagerly broke the neat seal, and, as they
say, ``devoured the contents'' of the letter addressed to her.

beloved aunt for him and the poor girl to whom all lis folle race have
shown such anparalleled affection. Ask Miss Crawl to receive her child-

 Your affectionate and great,
 REBEccA CrAWLED,''
Just as Brings had finished renling this affecting and interesting docu-
ment, which reinstated her in her position as first confidante of Miss Crew-
let, Is. Firkin entered the room.  There's Mrs. lBute Crawled just
arrived by the mail from Hampshire, and wants some tea, will you come
down and make breakfast, Miss2''
And to the surprise of rain, clasping her dressing-gown around her,
the wisp of her floating dishcvelled bechiul her, the little curl-papers still
stickiug in bunches round her forcheuul, Brings sailed down to MRs. lute
with the letter in her hand containing the wonderful news.
 Oh, Mrs. Firkin,'' gasped bEtter, '`such a business. MIss Sharp
have a gone and run away with the Cutting, and they're of' to Girton
Green.'' WE would devote n chapter to describe the motions of MRs.
Firkin, did not the passions of her mistresses occupy our genteelcr must.
When MRs. But Crawled, numbed with midnight travelling, and warm-
ing herself at the newly crackling parlour fire, herd from Miss Brings the
intelligence of the clandestine marriage, she declared it was quite prove-
lential that she should have arrived at such a time to assist poor dear
Miss Crawled in supporting the shock-the lcbccca was an artful little
hussy of whom she had always had her suspicions; and that is for
london Crawled, she never could account for his aunt's infutuation regard-
in him, and had long considered him a profligate, lost, and abandoned
being. And this awful conduct, MRs. But said, ill have at least tis
good effect, it will open poor dear Miss Crawled's eyes to the real cha-
matter of this wicked in. Than MRs. But had a comfortable hot trust
and tea; and as there was a vacant room in the house now, there was
no need for her to remain at the Gloster Coffee House where the ortsmouth
mail had set her down, and whence she ordered MIr. Bowls's able-de-camp
the footman to bring away her trunks.
Miss Crawled, be it known, did not leave her room until near noon-
taking chocolate in bed in the morning, while Beck Sharp rend the
Morning out to her, or otherwise amusing herself or dawdling. The
conspirators below grace that they would spare the dear lady's feelings
until she appeared in her drawing-room: meanwhile it was announced to
her, that Mrs. But Crawled had come up from Hampshire by the mail,
was staying at the Gloster, sent her love to Miss Crawled, and asked for
breakfast with Miss Brings. The arrival of Mrs. But, which would not
have caused any extreme delight at another period, was hailcd with plea-
sure now; Miss Crawled being pleased at the notion of a gossip with her
sister-in-law regarding the late Lady Crawled, the funeral arrangements
opening, and Sir Pitt's abrupt proposals to Rebecea.
142
VANITY FAIR.
It was not until the old lady was fairly ensconeed in her usual arm-
chair in the drawing-room, and the prcliminary embraces and inquiries
had taken place between the ladies, that the conspirators thought it needs-
able to submit her to the operation. Who has not admired the sacrifice
and delicate approacles with which women ``prepare'' their friends for
bad news Miss Crawled's two friends made such an apparatus of my-
very before they broke the intelligence to her, that they worked her up to
the necessary degree of doubt and alarm.
`'And she refused Sir Pitt, my dear dear Miss Crawled, prepare your-
self for it,'' Mrs. But said, ``because-because she couldn't help herself.''
Of course there was a reason,'' Miss Crawled answered. ``She like
somebody else. I told Brings so yesterday.''
 Likes somebody else1'' Brings gasped. O my dear friend, she is
married already.''
Married already,'' Mrs. But chimes in; and both sat with clasped
Hands looking from each other at their victim.
` Send her to me, the instant she comes in. The little sly wretch: how
land she not tell me?'' cried out Miss Crawled.
She won't come in soon. Prepare yourself, dear friend-she's gone
out of  long time-she's-she 's gone altogether.''
 Gracious goodness, and he's to make my chocolate Send for her
and have her back; I desire that she come back,'' the old lady said.
She lccnmped last night, Ma'am,'' cried Mrs. But.
 She left a letter for me,'' Brings exclaimed.  She's married to-''
Prepare her, for heaven's sake. Don't torture her, my dear Miss
rings.''
`She's married to whom ?'' cries the spinster in a nervous fury.
 o-to a relation of --''.
 She refused Sir Pitt,'' cried the victim. ` Speak at once. Don't
give me mad.''
nO Ma'am-prepare her, Miss Brings-she's married to don
Crawled.''
' don married-Rebecca-governess-nobody-Get out of my
house, you fool, you idiot-you stupid old Brings-how dare you?
You 'are in the plot-you male him marry, thinking that I'd leave my
money from him-you did, North,'' the poor old lady screamed in
hysterie sentences.
I, Ma'am, ask a member of this family to marry a drawing-master's
daughter 2''
 Her mother was a Montmoreney,'' cried out the old lady, pulling at
the bell with all her might.
 Her mother was an opera girl, and she has been on the stage or
worse herself,'' said Mrs. But.
Miss Crawled gave n final scream, and fell back in a faint. They were
forced to take her back to the room which she had just quitted. One it
of hysterics succeeded another. The doctor was sent for-the apothecary
arrived. Mrs. But took up the post of nurse by her bedside. `:1Her
relations ought to be round about her,'' that amiable woman said.
She had scarcely been carried up to her room, when a new person

Pitt.  Where's Beck ?'' he soil, coming in.  Where's her trapsf
He's coming with me to queen's Crawled,''
 Have you not heard the astonishing intelligence regarding her surrep-
tedious union'' Brings asked.
What 's that to me?'' Sir Pitt asked. Know she 's married. hat
makes no gods. Tell her to come down nt once, and not keep me.''
`' Are you not aware, Sir,'' Miss Brings asked, `` that she has left our
roof, to -the dismay of Miss Crawled, who is nearly killed by the telling-
hence of Captain Rawson's union with her?''
WHen Sir Pitt Crawled heard that Rebccca was married to his son, he
broke out into a fury of language, which it would do no good to repeat in
this place, as indeed it sent poor BRings shuddering out of the room; and
with her we will shut the door upon the figure of the frenziel old man,
wild with hatred and insane with battle desire.
One day after he went to queen's Sprawly, he burst like a madman
into the room she he used when there-dashed open her boxes with his
foot, and flung about her papers, clothes, and other relics. Miss llorrocks,
the butler's daughter, took some of them. The children dressed them-
selves and acted plays in the others. It was but a few days after the
poor mother had gone to her lonely burying-place; and was laid, unwept
and disregarded, in a vault full of strangers.
Suppose the old lady doesn't come to,'' Rawdon said to his little wife,
as they sat together in the snug little Brompton lodgings. She had been
trying the new piano all the young. he new gloves fitted her to a
nicety; the new shawls became her wonderfully; the ne rings glittered on
her little hands, and the new watch ticked at her waist; ``suppose she
don't come round, eh, Beck '
I'll make your fortune,'' she said; and Dalilah patted ameon's
cheek.

you can; and we'll drive down to the Star and Carter, and dine, by Jove.''

OF all the other articles which MIr. IInmmerdown all the honour to offer

days, when she used to play upon it, in the little sitting-room of our dear
Aelia Sedley.
The sale was at the old house in lussell Square, where we passed some
evenings together at the beginning of this story. Good old John Sedley
was a ruined man. His name had been proclaimed as n defaulter on the
Stock Exchange, and his bankruptcy and comnercinl determination had
followed. Mr. Borne's butler came to buy some of the famous port
wine to transfer to the cellars over the way. As for one dozen well-
manufactured silver spoons and forks at per of., and one dozen dessert
litto ditto, there were three young stockbrokers (Mesers. Dale, plight,
and Dale, of Threadneedle street, indeed), who having hal dealings with
the old man, and kindnesses from him in days when he was kind to
every boy with whom he dealt, sent this little spar out of the week with
their love to good MIss. Sedley; and with respect to the piano, is it had
been Amelin's, and as she might miss it and want one now, and as Can-
gain William Doing could no more play upon it, than he could dance on
the tight-rope, it is probable meant he did not purchase it for his own use.
In a word, it arrived that evening, at a wonderful small cottage in a
street leading from the Full Road-one of those streets which have
the finest romantic names-(this was called St. Adelaide Villns, And-
Maria Road, West), where the houses look like baby-houses; where the
people looking out of the first-floor windows, must infallibly, as you think,
it with their feet in the parlours; where the shrubs in the little gardens
in front, bloom with a percnninl display of little children's pinafores, little
red socks, caps, &c. (polyandria polygyniu); whence you hear the sound
of jingling spirits and women singing; where little portcr pots hang on
the railings running themselves; whither of evenings you see city clerks
pacing wearily : here it was that Mr. Clasp, the clerk of Mr. Seller, had
his domieile, and in this asylum the good old gentleman hid his hcud
with his wife and daughter when the crash came.
Joy Sedley had acted as a man of his disposition would, when the an-
ouncement of the family-misfortune reached him. lIe did not come to
London, but he wrote to his mother to draw upon his agent for whatever
money was wanted, so that is kind broken-spirited old parents had no
resent poverty to fear. This done, Joy went on at the boarding-house

his elaret; he played his rubber; he toll his Indian stories, and the Irish

say, tent the first day on which she saw her father lift up his head often
the failure, was of the receipt of the packet of forks and spoons with the
young stockroker's love, over which he burst out, crying like a child,
being greatly more affected than even his wife, to whom the present was
addressed. Edward Dale, the junior of the house, who purchased the
spoons for lie firm, was, in fact, very sweet upon Amelia, and offered for
her in spite of all. Ho married Miss Louisa Butts (daughter of 1light

Farine Hardenberg, and even the present Marquis of Londonderry, were
puzzled ; but how was this intelligence to effect a young lady in Hussell
square, before whose door the watchman sang the hours when slc was
asleep: who, if she strolled in the square, was guarded there by the
railings and the bread: who, if she walked ever so short a distance to
buy a ribbon in Southampton Row, was followed by black About with an
enormous cane: who was always cared for, dressed, put to bed, and
watched over by her so many guardian angels, with and without wages.

Old Sedley old kept his own and counsel. Everything seemed to go on
as usual in the quiet, opulent house: the good-naturel mistress pursuing,
quite suspiciously, her bustling idleness, and daily easy avocutions; the
daughter absorbed still in one selfish, tender thought, and quite regard-
less of all the world besides, when that foul crash came under which the
worthy family fell.
One night Mrs. Sedley was writing cards for a party; the Stories had
given one, and she must not be behiundhand; John Sedley, who had come
home very late from the city, sat silent at the chimney side, while his
wife was prattling to him; Emmy had gone up to her room ailing and

it was he that is the most moved, sudden as the clock was to her.
When he sank back into his seat, it was the wife that took the voice of
consoler. She took lis trembling hand, and kissed it, and put it round
her neck: she called him her John-her dear John-her old man-her
kind old man: she poured out a hundred words of incoherent love and

could not tell the old mother her doubts and cures: the would-be sisters
seemed every day more strange to her. And she had misgivings and fcurs
which she dared not acknowledge to herself, though she was always
secretly brooding over them.
Her heart tries to persist in asserting that George Borne was worthy
and faithful to her, though she knew otherwise. How many a thing had
she said, and got no echo from him. LoW many suspicions of selfishness
and indifference had she to encounter and obstinately overcome. To
whom could the poor little martyr tell these daily struggles and torturcs ?
Her hero himself only half understood her. She did not dare to own
that the man she loved was her inferior; or to feel that she had given her
heart away too soon. Given one, the pure bashful maiden was too

So imprisoned and tortured was this gentle little heart, when in the
month of March, Anno Domini 1815, Napoleon landed at Ones, an
Louis XVIII. fled, and all Europe was in alarm, and the funds fell, and
old John Sedley was ruined.
We are not going to follow the worthy old stockbroker through those
last pangs and agonies of ruin through which he passed before his come-
special demise befel. They declared him at the Stock Exchange; he was
absent from his house of business: his bills were protcsted : his act of
bankruptcy formal. The house and furniture of Russet Square were
seized and sold up, and he and his family were thrust away, as we have
seen, to hide their heads where they might.
John Sedley had not the heart to revicw the domestic establisluuent
who have appeared now and anon in our pages, and of whom he was now
forced by poverty to take leave. he wages of those worthy people were
disclarged with that punctuality which men frequently slow who only own
in great sums-they were sorry to leave good places-but they did not
break their hearts at parting from their adored master and mistress.

severely, that in six weeks he opened more than he had done for fifteen

was to marry Clergy's daughter. Any one of these circumstances would
account For the bitterness of Borne's opposition.
When one man has been under very remarkable obligations to another,
with whom he subsequently quarrels, a common sense of deeency, as it
were, makes of the former a much severer enemy than a merestranger would
be. To account for your own hardheartcdness and ingratitude in such a
case, you are bound to prove the other party's crime. It is not that you
are selfish, brutal, and angry at the failure of a speculation-no, no-it is
that your partner has led you into it by the basest treachery and with the
most sinister motives. From a mere sense of consistency, a persecutor is
bound to show that the fallen man is a villain-otherwise he the persccutor
is a wretch himself.
And as a general rule, which may make all cereditors who are inclined
to be severe, pretty comfortable in their minds, no men embarrassed are
altogether honest, very likely. They conceal something; they exaggerute
chances of good-luck, hide away the real state of affairs, say that things

pretext for delay, or of any money, so as to stave off the inevitable ruin a

had to break off the match between Sedley's daughter and his son; and as
it had gone very far indeed, and as the poor girl's happiness and perhaps
character were compromised, it was necessary to show the strongest
reasons for the rupture, and for John Borne to prove John Sedley to be
a very bad character indeed.
At the meetings of erelitors, then, he comforted himself with a savageness
and scorn towards Surely, which almost succeeded in breaking the heart
of that ruined bankrupt man. On George's intercourse with Amclia he
put an instant veto-menacing the youth with maledictions if he broke his
commands, and vilipenling the poor innocent girl as the basest and most
artful of vixens. One of the great conditions of anger and hatred is, that
you must tell and believe lies against the hated object, in order, as we said,
to be consistent.

When the great crash came-the announcement of ruin, and the de-
parture from Trusser Square, and the declaration that all was over between
her and George-all over between her and love, her and happiness, her
and faith in the world-a brutal letter from John Borne told her in a
few curt lines that her father's conduct had been of such a nature that all
engagements between the families were at an end-when the final aware
come, it did not clock her so much as her parents, us her mother rather
expected (for John Sedley himself was entirely prostrate in the ruins of
his own affairs and shattered honour). hmelia took the news very purely
and calmly. It was only the confirmation of the dark presages which had
long gone before. It was the mere reading of the sentence-of the crime
she had long ago been guilty-the crime of loving wrongly, too violently,
against reason. She told no more of her thoughts now than she had
before. She seemed scarcely more unhappy now when convinced all
hope was over, than before when she felt but dared not confess that it
was gone. So she changed from the large house to the small one without
any mark or difference ; remained less in her little room for the most

Whenever old John Sedley thought of the affair between (George and
Amelia, or alluded to it, it was with bitterness almost as great as Mr.
Scorned himself had shown. He cursed Osborue and his family as heart-
less, wicked, and ungrateful. No power on earth, he swore, would induce
him to marry his daughter to the son of such a villain, and he ordered
Emma to banish George from her mind, and to return all the presents and
letters which she had ever had from him.
She promised acquiescence, and tried to obey. Se put up the two or
three trinkets; and, as for the letters, she drew them out of the place
where she kept them; and rend them over-as if she did not know them
by heart already: but she could not part with them. That taylor was too
much for her; she placed them back in her bosom again-as you have

nothing-only a little promise which was snapt and worthless in n
moment. Along cngugemcnt is a partucrship which one party is free to
keep or to break, but which involves all the capital of the other.
Be cautious then, young ladies; be wary how you engage. Be shy of
loving frankly; never tell all you feel, or (a better way still) feel very
little. See the consequences of being precmaturely honest ad confiding,
and mistrust yourselves and everybody. Get yourselves married as they
do in France, where the lawyers are the bridesmaids and confidante. At
any rate, never had any feelings which may take you uncomfortable, or
make any promises which you cannot at any required moment command
and withdraw. That is the way to get on, and be respected, and have a
virtuous character in Vanity Air.
If Amelia could have heard the comments regarding her which were
male in the circle from which her father's ruin had just driven Her, she
would have seen what her own crimes were, and how entirely her character
was jeopnrdiel. Such criminal imprudence Mrs. Smith never know of;
such horrid familiarities Mrs. Brown lad always condemned, and the end
might be a warning to her daughters. ``Captain Borne, of course,
could not marry a bnkrupt's daughter,'' the Miss Dobbins sail.  It
was quite enough to have been swindled by the father. As for that little

anything you like, only do, do leave Miss Seller alone.''
Anything like William's infatuation about that silly little flirting, ogliug
thing was never known, the mamma and sisters agreed together in thinking
and they trembled lest, her engagement being off with Osborue, she should
take up immediately her other admirer and Captain. In which forelodings
these worthy young women no doubt judged according to the best of their
experience; or rather (for ss yet they had had no opportunities or marrying
or of jilting) according to their own notions of right and wrong.
It is a mercy, Mamma, that the regiment is ordered abroad,'' the
girls said. ``This danger, at any rate, is spared our brother,''
Such, indeed, was the fact; and soil is that the French lEmpcror comes
in to perform a part in this domestic comely of Vanity Fair which we are
now playing, and which would never have been enacted without the inter-
mention of this august mute personage. It was he that ruined the Hour-
on and Mr. John Sedley. It was he whose arrival in his capital called
up all France in arms to defend him there; and all Failure to onst him.
While the French nation and army were swenring fidelity round the eagles
in the Camp de Mai, four mighty Luropean hosts ere getting in motion
for the great class i l'aisle,: and one of these was a British army, of which
two heroes of ours, Captain Doing and Captain Borne, formed a
portion.
The news of Apollyon's escape and landing was received by the gallant
-th with a fiery delight and enthusiasm, which everybody can understand
who knows that famous corpse. from the colonel to the smallest summer
in the regiment, all were filled with hope and ambition and patriotic fury;
and thanked the French Emperor as for a personal kindness in coming
to disturb the peace of Europe. Now was the time the -th lad so
long wanted for, to show their comrades in arms that they could fight as
well as the Peninsular veterans, and that all the pluck and valour of the
-th had not been killed by the West Winds and the yellow fever. Stubble
and Spoony looked to get their companions without purchase. Before the
end of the campaign (which she resolved to share), Mrs. Maijor O'Down
hoped to write herself Mrs. Colonel O'Down,C.B. Our two friends (Doing
and Borne) were quite as much excited as the rest: and each in his
way-Mr. Doing very quietly, Mr. Borne very loudly and energetic-
only-was bent upon doing his duty, and gaining his share of honour and
distinction.
Te agitation tlrilling through the country and army in consequence of
this news was so great, that private matters were little needed: and hence
probably George Borne, just gazetted to his company, busy with great-
rations for the march, which must come inevitably, and panting for further
promotion-was not so much affected by other incidents which would
have interested him at a more quiet period. DIe was not, it must be con-

essie, very much cast down by good old Mr. Sedley's catastrophe. He
tried his new uniform, which became him very handsomely, on the day
when the first meeting of the creditors of the unfortunate gentleman took
place. His father told him of the wicked, rascally, shameful conduct of
the bankrupt, reminded him of what he had said about Amelia, and that
their conncxion was broken off for ever; and gave him that evening a
good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in which he
looked so well. Money was always useful to this free-ended young
fellow, and he took it without many words. The bills were up in the
Hedley house, where he had passed so many, many happy hours. He could
see them as he walked from home that night (to holD Slaughter', where
he put up when in town) shining white in the moon. That comfortable
home was shut, then, upon Amelia and her parents: where had they taken
refuge The thought of their ruin affected him not a little. He was
very melancholy that night in the coffee-room at the Slaughtcrs; and
drank a good deal, as his comrades remarked there.
Doing came in presently, cautioned him about the drink, which he
only took, he said, because he was dcuced low; but when his friend
began to put to him clumsy inquiries, and asked him for news in a sign-
cannot manner, Borne declined entering into conversation with him;
having, however, that he was devilish disturbed and unhappy.
Three days afterwards, Doing found Borne in his room at the bar-
sacks :-his head on the table, a number of papers about, the young
Captain evidently in a state of great desponlency. ` She's-she's sent
me back some things I gave her-some damned trinkets. Look heroes''
1here was a little packet directed in the well-known hand to Captain
George Scorned, and some things lying about-a ring, a silver knife he
had bought, as a boy, for her at a fair; a gold chain, and a locket with
hair in it. ' It's all over,'' said he, with a groan of sickening remorse.
Look, Will, you may read it if you like.''
There was a littleletter of a few lines, to which he pointed, which said:
' MY papa has ordered me to return to you these presents, which you
made in happier days to me; and I am to write to you for the last time.
I think, I know you feel as much as I do the blow which has come upon
as. It is I that absolve you from an engagement which is impossible in
our present misery. I am sure you had no share in it, or in the cruel us-

Farewell. Farewell. I pray Go to strengthen me to bear this and other

Doing was very soft-hearted. The sight of women and children in
pain always used to mclt him. he idea of Amelia broken-called and
lonely, tore that good-natured soul with anguish. And he broke out into
an emotion, which anybody who likes may consider unmanly. He swore
that Melia was an angel, to which Scorned said aye with all his heart.
He, too, had been rejoicing the history of their lives,-and had seen her

from her childhood to her present age, so sweet, so innocent, so charm-
ingly simple, and carelessly fond and tender.
What a pang it was to lose all that: to have had it and not prize it
A thousand homely scenes and recollections crowded on him-in which he
always saw her good and beautiful. And for himself, he blushed with
remorse and shame, as the remembrance of his own selfishness and indif-
fierce contrasted with that perfect purity. For a while, glory, war, every-
thing was forgotten, and the pair of friends talked about her only.
wHere are they P'' Borne asked, after a long talk, and a long pause,
-and, in truth, with no little shame at thinking that he had taken no steps
to follow her.  Where are they There's no address to the note.''
Doing knew. He had not merely sent the piano; but had written
note to Mrs. Sedley, and asked permission to come and see her,-and he
had seen her, and Amelia too, yesterday, before he came down to Chatham;
and, what is more, he had brought the farewell letter and packet which
had so moved them.
he good-natured fellow had found Mrs. Slave only too willing to
receive him, and greatly agitated by the arrival of the piano, which, as she'
conjectured, at have come from George, and was a signal of nmity on
his part. Captain Doing did not correct this crror of the worthy lady,
but listened to all her story of complaints and misfortunes with great sun-
path-consoled with her mosses and privatious, and agreed in reprchending
the cruel conduct of Mr, Borne towards his first benefactor. When she
had used her overflowing bosom somewhat, and poured forth many of her
sorrows, he had the courage to ask actually to see Amelia, who was above
in her room as usual, and whom her mother led trembling down stairs.
Her appearance was so ghastly, and her look of despair so pathetic,
that honest William Doing was frightened as he beheld it; and real the
most fatal forcbodings in that plec fixed face. After sitting in his come-
many a minute or two, she put the packet into his hand, and said, `` Tkc
this to Captain Borne, if you please, and-and I hope he's quite well-
and it was very kind of you to come and see us-and we like our new
house very much. And I-I think I'll go up-stairs, Mamma, for i'm not
very strong.'' And with this, and a courtesy and a smile, the poor child
went her way. The mother, as she led her up, cast back looks of anguish
towards Doing. The good fellow wanted no such appeal. DIe lord her
himself too foully for that. Inexprcssibla grief, and pity, and terror
pursued him, and he came away as if he was a criminal after seeing her.
When Shone heard that his friend and found her, he me hot and
anxious inquiries regarding the poor child. How was she2 HOw did
he look What did she say?' His comrade took his hand, and looked
him in the face.

more.

Nation. Buy was much too sad to answer her, or even to be aware of
the attempts the other was making in her favour.
Four hours after the talk between Doing and Borne, this servant-
maid came into Amelia's room, where she sat as usual, brooding silently
over her letters-her little treasures. The girl, smiling, and looking arch
and happy, made many trials to attract poor TOmmy's attention, who,
however, took no heed of her.

I'm coming,'' Emmy said, not looking round.
There's a message,'' the maid went on. ` There's something-some-

any more.'' And she gave her a letter, which Emmy took, and read.
`I must see you,'' the letter said. ` Dearest Emmy-dearest love-

George and her mother were outside, waiting until she had read the
letter.

E hae seen how Mrs. Firkin,
the lady's maid, as soon as
any event of importance to
the Crawled family came to
her knowledge, felt bound to
communicate it to Mrs. But
Crawled, at theReetory; and
have before mentioned how
particularly kind and attend-
time that good-natured lady
was to Miss Crawled's confi-
denial servant. She had
been a gracious friend to
Mrs. Brings, the companion,
also; and had secured the
latter's good will by a sum-
her of those attentions and
promises, which cost so little
in the making, and are yet so
valuable and agreeable to
the recipient. Indeed every
good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap
and yet how amiable these professions are, and what a flavour they give to
the most homely dish in life. Who was the blundering idiot who said
that '`fine words butter no parsnips?'' Half the parsnips of society are
served and rendered palatable with no other sasuce. As the immortal
Lewis Sober can make more delicious song for a halfpenny than an
ignorant cook in contact with pounds of vegetables and meat, so a skilful
artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so
much substantial benefit-stock in the hands of a mere bungler. Nay, we
know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs; whereas, most
will digest any amount of fine words, and be always eager for more of the
same food. Mrs. But had told Brings and Firkin so often of the depth
of her affection for them; and what she would do if she had Miss Crawled's
fortune for friends so excellent and attached, that the ladies in question
had the deepest regard for her; and felt as much gratitude and confidence
as if Mrs. But lad louder them with the most expensive favours.
Rawdon Crawled, on the other hand, like a selfish heavy dragoon as he
was, never took the least trouble to conciliate his aunt's tides-de-cnamp,
showed his contempt for the pair with entire frankness-made Firkin pull
off his boots on one occasion-sent her out in the rain on ignominious

message-and if he gave her a guinea, flung it to her as if it were a box
on the ear. As his Aunt, too, made a butt of Brings, the Captain followed
the example and levelled his jokes nt her-jokes about as delicate as a
kick from his charge. Whereas, Mrs. But consulted her in matters of
taste or difficulty, admired her poetry, and by a thousand acts of kindness
and politeness, showed her appreciation of Brings; and if she made Firkin
a twopenny-halfpenny present, accompanied it with so many comupliments,
that the two-penee-halfpenny was transmutel into gold in the heart of
the grateful waiting-maid, who, besides, was looking forwards quite con-
entirely to some prodigious benefit which must happen to her on the day
when Mrs. But came in to her fortune.
The different conduct of these two people is pointed out respecifully to
the attention of persons comencing the world. Praise everybody, I say
to such: need be squeamish, but speak out your ceompliment both point-
blank in a man's face, and behind his back, when you know there is a
reasonable chance of his hearing it again. Never lose a chance of saying a
kind word. As Collingwood never saw a vacant place in his estate but he
took un acorn out of his pocket and hopped it in; so deal with your come
elements through life. An aeorn costs noting; but it may sprout into a
prodigious bit of timber.
In a word, during Rawdon Crawled's prosperity, he was only obeyed with
sulky acquiescence; when his disgrace come, there was nobody to help or
pity him. Whereas, when Mrs. But took the command at Miss Crawled's
house, the garrison there were charmed to act under such a leader, ex-
pecting all sorts of promotion from her promises, her generosity, and her
kind words.
That he would consider himself beaten, after one defeat, and make no
attempt to regain the position he had lost, Mrs. But Crawled never
allowed herself to suppose. She knew Rcbecca to be too clever and
spirited, and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle; and felt
that she must prepare for that combat, and be incessantly watchful against
assault, or nine, or surprise.
In the first place, though she held the town, was she sure of the pain-
child inhabitants Would Miss Crawled herself hold out; and and she
not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted uversary The old lady
like Rawdon, and Rebecca, who amused her. Mrs. But could not dis-
guise from herself the fact that none of her party could so contribute to
the pleasures of the town-bred lady. ` My girls' singing, after that little
odious governess's, I know is unbearable,'' the candid rector's wife owned
to herself. t She always used to go to sleep when MIartha and Louisa
played their ducts. Jim's stiff college manners and poor der But's talk
about his dogs and horses always annoyed her. 1f I took her to the
Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, an fly, I know she would;
and might fall into that horrid Rawson's clutches again, and be the victim
of that little viper of a Sharp. Meanwhile, it is clear to me that she is
exceedingly unwell, and cannot move for some weeks, at any rate; during
which we must think of some plan to protect her fro the arts of those
unprincipled people.''
In the very best of moments, if anybody told Miss Crawled that she

was, or looked ill, the trembling old lady sent of for her doctor; and I
daresay she was very unwell after the sudden family event, which might
serve to shake stronger nerves than hers. At least, Mrs. But thought it
was her duty to inform the physician, and the apothecary, and the dame-
de-companion, and the domestic, that Miss Crawled was in a most critical
state, and that they were to act accordingly. She had the street laid knee-
deep with straw; and the knocker put by with Mr. Bowls's plate. She
insisted that the Doctor should call twice a day; and deluged her patient
with draughts eery two hours. When anybody entered the room, she
uttered a alaslslsh so vigilant and ominous, that it frightened the poor old
lady in her bed, from which she could not look without seeing Mrs. But's
beady eyes eagerly fixed on her, as the latter sat steadfast in the arm-chair
by the bed-side. They seemed to lighten in the dark (for she kept the

curtains closed) as she moved about the room on velvet paws like a cat.
There Miss Crawled lay for days-ever so many days-Mrs. But reading
books of devotion to her : for nights, long nights, during which she had to
hear the watchman sing, the night-light shutter ; visited at midnight, the
last thing, by the stealthy apothecary; and then left to look at Mrs. But's
twinkling eyes, or the flicks of yellow that the rushlight threw on the
dreary darkened ceiling. IIygeia herself would have fallen sick under such

it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death, and an utter
cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner.
Sick-bed homeless and pious reflections are, to be sure, out of place in
mere story-books, and we are not going (after the fashion of some novelists
of the present day) to cajole the public into a sermon, when it is only a
comedy that the reader pays his money to witness. But, without preach-
ing, the truth may surely be borne in mind, that the bustle, and triumph,
and laughter, and gaiety which Vanity Fir exhibits in public, do not
always pursue the performer into private life, and that the most dreary
depression of spirits and dismal repentance sometimes overcome him.
Recollection of the best ordained banquets will scarcely cheer sick epicures.
reminiscences of the most becoming dresses and brilliant bull triumphs
will go very little way to console faded beauties. Perhaps statesmen, at an
particular period of existence, are not much gratified at thinking over the
most triumphant divisions; and the success or the pleasure of yesterday
become of very small account when a certain (albeit uncertain) morrow is
in view, about which all of us must some day or other be speculating. O
brother wearers of motleyl Are there not moments when one grows sick
of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells This, dear
friends and companions, is my amiable object-to walk with you through
the Fair, to examine the shops and the shows there; and that we should
all come home after the flame, and the noise, and the gaiety, and be
perfectly miserable in private.
If that poor man of mine had a head on his shoulders,'' Mrs. But
Crawled thought to herself, `` how useful he might be, under present air-
cstances, to this unhappy old lady He might make her repent of her
shocking free-thinking ways; he might urge her to do her duty, and cast
off that odious reprobate who has disgraced himself and his family ; and
he might induce her to do justice to my dear girls and the two boys, who
require and deserve, I am sure, every assistance which their relatives can
give them.''
And, as the hatred of vice is always a progress towards virtue, MRs.
But Crawled endeavoured to instil into her sister-in-law a proper abhor-
rcnce for all Rawdon Crawled's nanifold sins: of which his uncle's wife
brought forward such a catalogue as indeed would have served to condemn
a whole regiment of young officers. If a man has committed wrong in life,
I don't know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the
world than his own relations; so Mrs. lBute showed a perfect family
interest and knowledge of women's history. She had all the particulars
of that ugly quarrel with Captain Firebrnce, in which Rawdon, wrong from
the beginning, ended in shooting the Captain. She knew how the un-
happy Lord Dovedale, whose mamma had taken a house at Oxford, so that
he might be educated there, and who had never touched a card in his life
till he came to London, was perverted by Rawdon at the Clock Tree, made
helplessly tipsy by this abominable seducer and perverter of youth, and
fleeces of four thousand pounds. She described with the most vivid
minuteness the agonies of the country families whom he had ruined-the
sous whom he had plunged into dishonour and poverty-the daughters

165
whom he had inveigled into perdition. She knew the poor tradesmen
who were bankrupt by his extravagance-the mean shifts and rogueries
with which he had ministered to it-the astounding falseloods by which
he had imposed upon the most generous of aunt, and the ingratitude and
ridicule by which he had renaid her snerifices. She imparted these stories
gradually to Miss Morley; gave her the whole benefit of them; felt it to
be her bounden duty as a Christian woman and mother of a family to do
so; had not the smallest remorse or compunetion for the victim whom her
tongue was violating; nay, very likely thought her act was quite mere-
serious, and plumed herself upon her resolute manner of performing it.
as, if a man's character is to be abused, say what you will, there'as
nobody like a relation to do the business. And one is bound to own,
regarding this unfortunate wretch of a Random Crawled, that the men
truth was enough to condemn him, and that all inventions of scandal were
quite superfluous pains on his friends' parts.
Rebecea, too, being non a relative, came in for the fullest sure of Mrs.
But's kind inquiries. This indetfatigble pursuer of truth (having given
strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissarics or letters
from London), took Miss Crawled's carriage, and drove to her old friend
Miss Pinkerton, at Minerva House, Chiswick Mill, to whom she announced
the dreadful intelligence of Captain Rawson's seduction by Miss Sharp,
and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the ex
governess's birth and early history. The friend of the Lexicographer had
plenty of information to give. Miss Jemima was made to fetch the draw-
ing-master's receipts and letters. This one was from a singing-house:
that entreated an advance: another was full of gratitude for Ilebecca's
reception by the ladies of Chiswick: and the last document from the
unlucky artist's pen was that in which, from his dying bed, e recom-
mended his orphan child to Miss Pinkerton's protection. There were
juvenile letters and petitions from Ilebecca, too, in the collection, imploring
and for her father, or delaring her own gratitude. Perhaps in Vanity Fair
there are no better sntires than letters. Take a bundle of your dear

new niece's parentage, education, and behaviour as would scarcely have
pleased Rebecca, had the latter known that such inquiries were being made
concerning her.
Of all these industrious researches Miss Crawled had the full benefit.
Mrs. Rawdon Crawled was the daughter of an opera girl. She had danced
herself. She had been a model to the painters. She was brought up as
became her mother's daughter. She drank in with her father, &e. c.
It was a lost woman who was married to a lost man; and the moral to
be inferred from Mrs. But's tale was, that the knavery of the pair was
irremediable, and that no properly-conducted person should ever notice
them again.
These were the materials which prudent MRs. But gathered together
in Park Lane, the provisions and admonition as it were with which she
fortifiel the house against the liege which she knew that Rawdon and his
wife would lay to Miss Crawled.
But if an fault may be found with her arrangements, it is this, that she
was too eager: she managed rather too well; undoubtedly she made Miss
Crawled more ill than was necessary; and though the old invalid such-
come to her authority, it was so harassing and severe, that the victim
would be inclined to escape at the very first chance which fell in her way.
Mnnaging women, the ornaments of their sex,-women who order every-
thing for everybody, and know so much better than any person concerned
what is good for their neighbours, don't sometimes speculate upon the
possibility of a domestic revolt, or upon other extreme consequences
resulting from their overstrained authority.
Thus for instance Mrs. But, with the best intentions no doubt in the
world, and wearing herself to death as she did by foregoing sleep, dinner,
fresh air, for the sake of her invalid sister-in-law, carried her conviction of
the old lady's illness so far that she almost managed her into her coffin.
She pointed out her sacrifices and their results one day to the constant
apotheecary, Mr. Clump.
I am sure, my dear Mr. Clump,'' she said, '`no efforts of mine have
been wanting to restore our dear invalid, whom the ingratitude of her
nephew has laid on the bed of sickness. I never shrink from personal
discomfort: I never refuse to sacrifice myself.''
Your devotion, it must be confessed, is admirable,'' Mr. Clump says,
with a low bow; `` but--''

t Ihae scarcely closed my eyes since my april: I give up sleep, health,
every comfort, to my sense of duty. When my poor James was in the
small-box, did I allow any hireling to nurse him No.''
You did what became an excellent mother, my dear Madam-the best
of mothers; but-''
`As the mother of a family and the wife of an English clergyman, I
humbly trust that my principles are good,'' Mrs. But said, with a happy
solemnity of conviction; ``and, as long as Nature supports me, never,
never, Mr. Clump, will I desert the post of duty. Others may bring that
gray heal with sorrow to the bed of sickness, (ere Mrs. But, waving her
hand, pointed to one of old Miss Crawled's coffee-coloured fronts, which
was perched on a stand in the dressing-room), but I will never quit it.
Ah, Mr. Clumpl I fear, I know, that that couch needs spiritual as well as
medical consolation.''
What I was going to observe, my dear Madam,''-here the resolute
Clump once more interposed with a bland air-``what I was going to
observe when you gave utterance to sentiments which do you so much
honour, was that I think you alarm yourself needlessly about our kind
friend, and sacrifice your own health too prodigally in her favour.''
I would lay down my life for my duty, or for any member of my
husband's family,'' Mrs. But interposed.
 Yes, Madam, if need were; but we don't want Mrs. But Cruelty to
be a martyr,'' Clump sail gallantly. Dr. Sequins and myself have both
considered Miss Crawled's case with every anxiety and care, as you may
suppose. We see her low-spirited and nervous; family events have ago-
hated her''
 Her nephew will come to perdition,'' Mrs. Crawled cried.
Have agitated her: and you arrived like a guardian angel, my dear
Madam, a positive guardian angel, I assure you, to soothe her under
the pressure of calamity. But Dr. Sequins and I were thinking that our
amiable friend is not in such a state as renders confinement to her bed
necessary. She is depressed, but this confinement perhaps adds to her
depression. She should have change, fresh air, gaiety; the most delight-
ful remedies in the pharmacopia,'' Mr, Clump sir, grinding and showing
his handsome teeth. Persuade her to rise, dear Madam; drag her from
her couch and her low spirits; insist upon her take little drives. hey
will restore the roses too to your cheeks, if I may so speak to Mrs. lBute
Crawled.''
The sight of her horrid nephew casually in the Park, where I am told
the wretch drives with the brazen partner of his crimes,'' Mrs. But said,
(letting the cat of selfishness out of the bag of secrecy), ``would cause her
such a shock, that we should have to bring her back to bed again. She
must not go out, Mr. Clump. She shall not go out as long as I remain
to watch over her. And as for my health, what matters it? I give it
cheerfully, Sir. I sacrifice it at the altar of my duty,''
 Upon my word, Mind,'' Mr. Clump now said bluntly, I won't
answer for her life if she remains locked up in that dark room. She is so
nervous that we may lose her any day; and if you wish Captain Called
to be her heir, I warn you frankly, Madam, that you are doing your very
best to see him.''

PITY AIR.
e Gracious mere1 is her life in danger'' Mr. But cried.  Why,
why, Mr. Clump, did you not inform me sooner2''
he night before, Mr. Clump and Dr. Squires had had a consultation (over
 bottle of wine at the house of Sir Lain Warren, whose lady was about
to present him with a thirteent blessing), regarding Miss Crawled and
her case.
What a little harpy that woman from Hampshire is, Clump,'' Sequins
remarked, `` that has seized upon old Till Crawled. Devilish good
Mndeira.''
e What a fool Rawdon Crawled has been,'' Clump replied, ``to go and
marry a governess There was something about the girl, too,''
 Green eyes, fair skin, pretty figure, famous front development,''
Sequins remarked. There is something about her; and Crawl was a
fool, Sequins.''
A d- fool-always was,'' the apothecary replied.
Of course the old girl will fling him over,'' said the physician, and
after a pause added, ` She'll cut up well, I suppose,''
Cut up,'' says Clump with a grin; ` I wouldn't have her cut up for
two hundred a year.''
e That Hampshire woman will kill her in two months, Clump, my boy,
if she stops about her,'' Dr. Sequins said. :Old woman; full fender;
nervous subject; palpitations of the heart; pressure on the brain; ago-
place; off she goes. Get her up, quills; get her out: or I would'not
give many weeks' purchase for your two hundred a year.'' And it was
acting upon this hint that the worthy apothecary spoke with so much can-
door to Mrs. But Cruelty.
HAving the old lady under her hand; in bed; with nobody near, MRs.
But had made more than one assault upon her, to induce her to alter her
will. But Miss Crawled's usual terrors regarding death increased greatly
when such dismal propositions were made to her, and MRs. BRute saw that
she must get her patient into cheerful spirits and health before she could
hope to attain the pious object which she had in view. Whither to take
her was the next puzzle. The only place where she is not likely to meet
those odious Brandon is at church, and that won't amuse her, MRs. But
justly felt, : We must go and visit our beautiful suburbs of London,''
she then thought. I hear they are the most picturesque in the world;''
and so she had a sudden interest for Hampsteud, and Horses, and found
that Dulwich had great charms for her, and getting her victim into her
carriage, drove her to those rustic spots, beguiling the little journeys with
conversations about Rawdon and his wife, and telling every story to the
old lady which could add to her indignation against this pair ofreprobates.
Perhaps Mrs. But pulled the string unnecessarily tight. For though
she worked upon Miss Craven to a proper dislike of her disobedient nephew,
the invalid had a great hatred and secret terror of her vietimizer, and
pantel to escape from her. After a brief space, she rebelled against High-
gate and Journey utterly. She would go into the Park. MRs. But knew
they would meet the abominable Rawdon there, and she was right. One
day in the ring, Rawson's stanhope came in sight; Recent was seated by
him. In the enemy's equipage Miss Cruelty occupied her usual place,

with Mrs. But on her left, the poodle and Miss Brings on the back seat.
It was a nervous moment, and ebeccn's heart beat quick as she recognised
the carriage; and as the two vehicles crossed each other in the line, she
clasped her hands, and looked towards the spinster with n free of agonised
attachment and devotion. Newson himself tremble, and his face grew.
purple behind his dyed mustachios. Only old BRings was moved in the
other carriage, and cast her great eyes nervously towards her old friends.
Miss Crawled's bomet was resolutely turned towards the sentinel. MRs,
But happened to be in ecstasies with the poodle, and was pulling him a
little darling, and a sweet little foggy, and a pretty pet. The carriages
moved on, each in his line.
 Done, by Jove,'' Rawdon said to his wife.
 Try once more, Rawdon,'' Rebecca answered, '`Could not you look your
wheels into theirs, dearest ''
Rawdon had not the heart for that maneure. When the carriages
met again, he stood up in his stanhope; he raised his hand ready to off
his hat; he looked with all his eyes. But this time Miss Crawled's face
was not turned away; she and MRs. But looked him full in the face, and
cut their nephew pitiless. He sank back in his sent with an oath, and
striking out of the ring, dashed away desperately homewards.
It was a gallant and deed triumph for Mrs. lBute. bUt she felt the
danger of many such meetings, as she saw the evident nervousness of Miss
Crawled; and she determined that it was most necessary for her dear
friend's health, that they should leave town for a while, and reconunended
Brighton very strongly.

liamDobbin found himself the great
promoter, arranged, and manager of
the match between George Scorned
and Amelia. But for him it never
would have taken place: he could
not but confess as much to himself,
and smiled rather bitterly as he
thought that he of all men in the
world should be the person upon
whom the care of this marriage had
fallen. But though indeed the con-
ductingof this negotiationwas about
as painful a task as could be set to
him, yet when he had a duty to
perform, Captain Doing was accus-
tomed to go through it without
many words or much hesitation;
and, having made up his mind completely, that if Miss Sedley was balked
of her husband she would die of the disappointment, he was determined to
use all his best endeavours to keep her alive.
I forbear to enter into minute particulars of the interview between
George and Mmelia, when the former was brought back to the feet (or
should we venture to say the arms) of his young mistress by the inter-
mention of his friend honest William. A much harder heart than George's
would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly ravaged by
grief and despair, and at the simple tender accents in which she told her
little broken-hearted story: but as she did not faint when her mother,
trembling, brought Borne to her; and as she only gave relief to her
oercharged grief, by laying her head on her lover's shoulder and there
weeping for a while the most tender, copious, and refreshing tears-old
Mrs. Seller, too greatly relieved, thought it was best to leave the young
persons to themselves; and so quitted Emmy crying over George's hand,
and kissing it humbly, as if it were her supreme chief and master, and as
if she were quite a guilty and unworthy person needing every favour and
grace from him.
This prostration and sweet unrepining obedience exquisitely touched
and flattered George Borne. He saw a slave before him in that simple
yielding faithful creature, and his soul within him thrilled secretly some-
how at the knowledge of his power. He would be generous-minded,
Bultan as he was, and raise up this kneeling Esther and make a queen of

141
her : besides, her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her sun-
mission, and so he cheered her, and raised her up and forgave her, so to
speak. All her hopes and feelings, which were dying and withering, this
her sun having been removed from her, bloomed again and at once, its light
being restored. You would scarcely have recognised the beaming little
face upon Amelia's pillow that night as the one that was laid there the
night before, so wan, so lifeless, so careless of all round about. The
honest Irish maid-servant, delighted with the change, asked leave to
kiss the face that had grown all of a sudden so rosy. Amelia put her
arms round the girl's neck and kissed her with all her heart, like a child.
She was little more. She had that night a sweet refreshing sleep, like
one-and what a spring of inexpressible happiness as she woke in the
morning sunshine
He will be here again to-day,'' Amelia thought.  He is the greatest
and bestow men.'' And the fact is, that George thought he was one of the
generousest creatures alive: and that he was making a tremendous
sacrifice in marrying this young creature.
While she and Borne were having their delightful tete-a-the above
stairs, old Mrs. Sedley and Captain Doing were conversing low upon
the state of the affairs, and the chances and future arrangements of the
young people. Mrs. Sedley having brought the two lovers together and
left them embrcing each other with all their might, like a true woman,
was of opinion that no power on earth would induce Mr, Sadly to consent
to the match between his daughter and the son of a man who had so
shamefully, wickedly, and monstrously treated him. ANd she told a long
story about happier days and their earlier splendours, when Borne lived
in a very humble way in the New Road, and his wife was too lad to
receive some of Joy's little baby things, with which Mrs. Sedley room-
floated her at the birth of one of Borne's own children. The friends
ingratitude of that man, she was sure, had broken Mr. S.'s heart: and as
for a marriage, he would never, never, never, never consent.
 They must run away together, Ma'am,'' Doing said, laughing, '`'and
follow the example of Captain Rawdon Crawled, and Miss Emmy's friend
the little governess,'' Was it possible? Well she never Mrs. Sedley
was all excitement about this news. She wished that Blenkinsop were
here to hear it : Blenkinsop always mistrusted that Miss Sharp.-What an
escape Joy and had and she described the already well-known love-
passages between Rehecca and the Collect of Boggleywollh.
It was not, however, Mr. Shelley's wrath which Doing feared, so much
as that of the other parent concerned, and he owned that he had a very
considerable doubt and anxiety respecting the behaviour of the black-
browed old tyrant of a Russia merchant in llussell Square. DIe has for-
bidden the match peremptorily Doing thought. He knew what a savage
determined man Borne was, and how he stuck by his word. The only
chance George has of reeoncilement,'' argued his friend, `` is by distinguish-
ing himself in the coming campaign. If he dies they both go together. If
he fill in distinction-what then He has some money from his mother,
I have heard-enough to purchase his majority-or he must sell out and
go and dig in Canada or rough it in a cottage in the country,'' With such

NAY AIR.
a partner Doing thought he would not mind Siberia-and, strange to say,
this absurd and utterly imprudent young fellow never for a moment con-
indeed that the want of means to keep a nice carriage and horses, and of
an income which should enable its possessors to entertain their friends
generally, ought to operate as bars to the union of George and Miss Sedley.
It was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the
marriage should take place as quickly as possible. Was he anxious him-
self, I wonder, to have it over?-as people, when death has occurred, like
to press forward the funeral, or when a parting is resolved upon, hasten it.
It is certain that Mr, Doing, having taken the matter in hand, was most
extraorlinarily eager in the conduct of it. He urged on George the
necessity of immediate notion : he showed the chances of reconciliation
with his father, which a favourable mention of his name in the Gazette
must bring about. If need were he would go himself and blue both the
fathers in the business. At all events, he besought George to go through
with it before the orders came, which everybody expected, for the
departure of the regiment from England on foreign service.
Bent upon these hymeneal projects, and with the applause and consent
of Mrs, Sedley, who did not care to break the matter personally to her
husband, Mr. Doing went to seek John Sedley at his house of call in the
City, the Typical Coffee-house, where, since his own offices were shut up,
and fate had overtaken him, the poor brown-own old gentleman used to
betake himself daily, and write letters and receive them, and the them up
into mysterious bundles, several of which he carried in the llaps of his coat.
I don't know anything more dismal than that business and bustle and
mystery of a ruined man: those letters from to wcalthy which he shows
you: those worn gseasy doeuments promising support and rolling con-
silence which he places wi.-fully before you, and on which he builds his
hopes of restoration me little fortune. My beloved reader has no doubt
in the course of his experience been waylaid by many such a luckless come-
passion. DIe takes you into the corner; he has his bundle of papers out
of his gaping coat pocket ; and the take off, and the string in his mouth,
and the favourite letters selected and laid before you; and he does not
know the sad eager half-crazy look which he fixes on you with his
hopeless eyes
Changed into a man of this sort, Doing found the once florid, jovial,
and prosperous John Seller. IIi coat, that used to be so glossy and trim,
was white at the seams, and the buttons showed the copper. His face
had fallen in, and was unshorn ; his fill and neckcloth hung limp under
his begging waistcoat. When he used to treat the boys in old days at a
free-house, he would shout and laugh louder than anybody there, and
had all the waiters skipping round him; it was quite painful to see how
humble and civil he was to Joy of the Topic, a blear-eyed old attendant
in dingy stockings and cracked pump, whose business it was to serve
glasses of waters, and summers of ink in pewter, and slices of paper to the
frequenters of this dreary house of entertainment, where nothing else
seemed to be consumed.  As for William Doing, whom he had tipped
repeatedly in his youth, and who had been the old gentleman's but on a
thousand occasions, old Sedley give his hand to him in a very hesitating

humble manner now, and called him ``Sir.'' A feeling of shame and remorse
took possession of William Sobbing as the broken old man so received and
addressed him, as if he himself had been somehow guilty of the misery-
tunes which had brought Sedley so low.
I am very glad to see you, Captain Doing, Sir,'' says he, after a
kulking look or two at his visitor (whose lanky figure and military appear-
ance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the blear eyes of the
waiter in the cracked dancing pups, and awakened the old lady in black,
who loved among the mouldy old coffee-cups in the bar). ` How is the
worthy alderman, and my lady, your excellent mother, Sir'' He looked
round at the winter as he said, ``My lady,'' as much as to say, '`Hark ye,
John, I have friends still, and persons of rank and reputation, too.'' Are
you come to do anything in my way, sir My young friends Dale and
Bigoted do ull my business for me now, until my new offices are ready
f6r I'm only here temporarily, you know, Captain. What can we do for
you, sir Will you like to take anything''
Sobbing, with a great let of hesitation and stuttering, protestel that
he was not in the least hungry or thirsty; that he had no business to
transact; that he only came to ask if Mr. Sedley was well, and to shake
hands with an old friend; and, he added, with a desperate perversion of
truth, `` My mother is very well-that is, she's been very unwell, and is
only waiting for the first fine day to go out and call upon Mrs. Sedley.
How is Mrs. Sedley, Sir I hope she's quite well,'' And here he paused,
reflecting on his own eonsummate hypocrisy; for the day was as fine, and
the sunshine as bright as it ever is in Cotlin Court, where the Tapiocea
Coffee-house is situated; and Mr. Doing remembered that he had seen
Mrs. Sedley himself only an hour before, having driven Borne down to
Fulham in his gig, and left him there tete-a-te with Miss Amelia.
My wife will be very happy to see her ladyship,'' Sedley replied,
pulling out his papers. : I'be a very kind letter here from your father,
Air, and beg my respectful compliments to him. Lady D. will find us in
rather a smaller house than we were accustomed to receive our friends in;
but it's sun, and the change of air does good to my daughter, who was
suffering in town rather-you remember little eMma, Sir P-yes, suffering
a good deal.'' The old gentleman's eyes were wandering as he spoke,
and he was thinking of something else, as he sat drumming on his papers
and fumbling at the worn red take.
You're a military man,'' he went on;`` I ask you, Bill Doing, could
any man ever have speculated upon the return of that Corsican scoundrel
from LampS When the allied sovereigns were here last year, and we gave
'em that dinner in the City, Sir, and we saw the temple of Concern, and
the framework, and the Chinese bridge in St. James's Park, could any
sensible man suppose that peace was'nt really concluded, after we'd
actually sung e De for it, Sir I ask you, William, could I suppose
that the Emperor of Austria was a damned traitor-n traitor, and nothing
more I don't mince words-a double-faced infernal traitor and schemer,
who meant to have his son-in-law back all along. And I say that the
escape of Money from Elbn was a damned imposition and plot, Sir, in
which half the powers of Europe were concerned, to bring the funds down,

and to ruin this country. That 's why I'm here, William. That's why
my name 's in the Gazette. Why, Sir -because I trusted the Emperor of
Russia and the Prince Regent. Look here. Look at my papers. Look
what the funds were on the last of MIrth-what the French lives were
when I bought for the account. And what they'are at now. There was
collusion, Sir, or that villain never would have escaped. Where was the
English Commissioner who allowed him to get away? He ought to be
shot, Sir-brought to a court-partial, and shot, by Jove.''
 We're going to hunt Money out, Sir,'' Doing said, rather alarmed at
the fury of the old man, the veins of whose forehead began to swell, and
who sat drumming his papers with his clenched fist.  We are going to
hunt him out, Sir-the Duke 's in Belgium already, and we expect march-
ing orders every day.''
`Give him no quarter. Bring back the villain's head, Sir. Shoot the
coward down, Sir,'' Sedley roared. I'd enlist myself, by -; but I'm
a broken old man-ruined by that damned scoundrel-and by a parcel of
swindling tieves in this country whom I made, Sir, and who are rolling
in their carriages now,'' he added, with a break in his voice.
Doing was not a little affected by the sight of this one kind old friend,
crazed almost with misfortune and raving with senile under. Pity the
fallen gentleman: you to whom money and fair repute are the chiefest
good; and so, surely, are they in Vanity Fair.
 Yes,'' he continued, '` there are some vipers that you warm, and they
sting you afterwards. There are some beggars that you put on horseback,
and they 'are the first to hideous down. on know whom I can, William
Doing, my boy. I mean a purse-proud villain in Trusses Square, whom
I knew without a shilling, and whom I pray and hope to see a beggar as
he was when I befriended him.''
I have heard something of this, Sir, from my friend George,'' Doing
said, anxious to come to his point.  The quarrel between you and his father
has cut him up a great deal, Sir. Indeed, I'm the bearer of a message
from him.''
O, that's your errand, is it?'' eriel the old man, jumping up
e WHat l perhaps he consoled with me, does he Very kind of him, the
stir-backed prig with his dignified airs nd West-end swsagger. He's
hankering about my house, is he still: If my son had the courage of a
man, he'd shoot him. He's as big a villain as his father. I won't have
his name mentioned in my house. I curse the day that ever I let him into
it; and I'd rather see my daughter deal at my feet than married to him.''
His father's harshness is not George's fault, Sir. Your daughter's
love for him is as much your doing as his. Who are you, that you are to
play with two young people's affections and break their hearts at your will''
recollect it's not his father that breaks the match off,'' old Sedley
cried out. It's I that forbid it. That family and mine are separated
for her. I'm fallen low, but not so low as that: no, no. And so you
may tell the whole race-son, and father, and sisters, and all,''
`It 's my belief, Sir, that you have not the power of the right to sep-
rate those two,'' Doing answered in a low voice; ``and that if you don't
give your daughter your consent, it will be her duty to marry without it.

There's no reason she should die or live miserably because you are wrong-
headed. To my thinking she 'as just as much married as if the banns had
been read in all the churches in London. And what better answer can
there be to Borne's charges against you, as charges there are, than that
his son claims to enter your family and marry your daughter''
A light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old Sedley
as this point was put to him: but he still persisted that with his consent
the marriage between Amelia and George should never take place.
We must do it without,'' Doing said, smiling, and told Mr. Sedley, as
he had told Mrs. Sedley in the day, before, the story of Rebecca's element
with Captain Crawled. It evidently amused the old gentleman. ` You're
terrible fellows, you Captain,'' said he, tying up his papers; and his face
wore something like a smile upon it, to the astonishment of the blear-
eyed waiter who now entered, and had never seen such an expression upon
Sedley's countenance since he had used the dismal coffee-house.
The idea of hitting his enemy Borne such a blow soothed, perhaps,
the old gentleman : and, their colloquy presently ending, he and Doing
parted pretty good friends.

`My sisters say she has diamonds as big as pigeons' eggs,'' George said
laughing. ``How they must set off her complexion A perfect illumina-
lion it must be when her jewels are on her neck. Her jet-black hair is
as curly as Shame's. I dare say she wore a nose-ring when she went to

George, in conversation with hmelia, was rallying the appearance of a

knee, and who was an object of vast respect to the Trusser Square family.

house in Portland Place. The name of the rich West India spheres had
been mentioned with applause in the Morning Post. Mrs. Haggistoun,
Colonel Hggistoun's widow, her relative, `` chaperonel'' her, and kept her
house. She was just from school, where she had completed her education,
and George and his sisters had met her at an evening party at old Hunger's
house, Deonshire Place (Hunger, Bullocek, & Co. were long the correspon-
dens of her house in the West Winds), and the girls had made the most
cordial advances to her, which the caress had received with great good
humour. An orphan in her position-with her money-so interesting

drove to see her the very next day. Mrs. IHaggistoun, Colonel Haggard-
town's widow, a relation of Lord Inside, and always talking of him, struck
the dear unsophisticasted girls as rather haughty, and too much inclined to
talk about her great relations: but Rhoda was everything they could wish
--the frankest, kindest, most agreeable creature-wanting a little polish,
but so good-natured. The girls Christian-named each other at once.
You should have seen her dress for court, Emmy,'' Borne cried,
laughing. ' She came to my sisters to show it of, before she was pre-
seated in state by my Lady Inside, the Haggistoun's kinswoman. She'a
related to every one, that Haggistoun. Her diamonds blazed out like Vaux-
hall on the night we were there. (Do you remember Vauxhall, May,
and Joy singing to his dearest middle middle darling) Diamonds and
mahoguny, my dear think what an advantageous contrast-and the white
feathers in her hair-I mean in her wool. he had ear-rings like change-
lies; you might hare lighted 'em up, by Jove-and a yellow satin train
that streeled after her like the tail of a comet.''
'How old is she'' asked Emma, to whom George was rattling away
regarding this dark paragon, on the morning of their re-union-rattling
away as no other man in the world surely could.
Way, the Black Prineess, though she has only just left school, must
be two or three and twenty. And you should see the hand she writes
Mrs. Colonel Haggistoun usually writes her letters, but in a moment of
confidence, she put pen to paper for my sisters; she spelt satin sitting,
and Saint James's, aunt Jams.''
 Why, surely it must be Miss Starts, the parlour border,'' Emmy
said, remembering that good-natured young Mutton girl, who had been
so hysterically affected when Amelia left Miss Pinkerton's academy.
The very name,'' George said.  Her father was a German Jew-s
slave-owner they say-connected with the Cannibal Islands in some way
or other. HIe died last year, and Miss Pinkerton has finished her ducks-
lion. He can play two pieces on the piano; she knows three songs; she
can write when Mrs. Haggistoun is by to spell for her; and Jane and
MInor already have got to love her as a sister.''
i wish they would have loved me,'' said Emmy, wistfully.  They
were always very cold to me.''
My dear child, they would have loved you if you had had two hundred

thousand pounds,'' George replied. ``That is the way in which they have
been brought up. Ours is a ready-money society. We live among
bankers and city big-wigs, and be hanged to them, and eery man, as he
talks to you, is jingling his guineas in his pocket. There is that jackass
Red Bullock, is going to marry Maria-there 's Goldmore, the Dust India
Director, there 's Daily, in the tallow trade-our trade,'' George said,
with an uneasy laugh and a blush. ``Curse the whole pack of money-
grubbing vulgariansl I fall asleep at their great heavy dinners. I feel
ashamed in my father's great stupid parties. I've been accustomed to live
with gentlemen, and men of the world and fashion, may, not with a
parcel of turtle-fed tradesmen. Dear little woman, you are the only person
of our set who ever looked, or thought, or spoke like a lady: and you do
it because you 'are an angel and can't help it. Don't remonstrate. you are
the only lady. Didn't Miss Crawled remark it, who has lies in the best
company in Europe And as for Crawled, of the Life Guard, hang it,
he 's a fine fellow: and I like him for marrying the girl he had chosen.''
Amelia admired Mr. Crawled very much, too, for this; and trusted
Rebecca would be happy with him, and hoped (with a laugh) Joy would
be consoled. And so the pair went on prattling, as in quite early days.
Amelia's confidence being perfectly restored to her, though she expressed
a great deal of pretty jealousy about Miss Swartz, and professed to be
dreadfully frightened-like a hypocrite as she was-lest George should
forget her for the heroes and her money and her estates in Saint Kitts.
But the fact is, she was a great deal too happy to have fears or doubts or
misgivings of any sort: and having George at her side again, was not
afraid of any caress or beauty, or indeed of any sort of danger.
When Captain Doing came back in the afternoon to these people-
which he did with a great deal of sympathy for them-it did his lent
good to see how Amelia had grown young again-how she laughed, and
chirped, and sang familiar old songs at the piano, which were only inter-
roused by the bell from without proclaiming Mr. Sedley's return from the
City, before whom George received a signal to retreat.
Beyond the first smile of recognition-and even that was an hypoerisy,
for she thought his arrival rather provoking-Miss Seller did not once
notice Doing luring his visit. But he was content, so that he saw her
happy; and thankful to have been the means of making her so.

plain people, but a warm welcome, my dear Miss Rhoda-Rhoda, let me

like you. A glass of Champagnel Hicks, Champagne to Miss Swartz.''
There is little doubt that old Borne believed all he said, and that the
girls were quite earnest in their protestations of affection for Miss Swurtz.
People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally. If the
simplest people are disposed to look not a little kindly on great Prosperity,
(for I defy any member of the British public to say that the notion of
Wealth has not something awful and pleasing to him; and you, if you are

society. They give a loose to their feelings on proper occasions. And
the proof is, that the major part of the Borne family, who had not, in
fifteen years, been able to get up a hearty regard for Amelia Sedley, became
as fond of Miss Swnrtz in the course of a single evening us the most
romantic advocate of friendship at first-sight could desire.
What a match for George she'd be (the sister and Miss Wit agreed),
and how much better than that insignificant little Amelial Such a
dashing young fellow as he is, with his good looks, rank, and accomplish-
meets, would be the very husband for her. Visions of balls in Portland
Place, presentations at Court, and introductions to half the peerage, filled
the minds of the young ladies; who talked of nothing but George and his
grand acquaintances to their beloved new friend.
Old Borne thought she would be a great match, too, for his son. He
should leave the army; he should go into Parliament ; he should cut a
figure in the fashion and in the state. His blood boiled with honest
British exultation, as he saw the name of Borne ennoble in the person
of his son, and thought that he might be the progenitor of a glorious line
of bnronets. He worked in the City and on 'Change, until he knew
everything relating to the fortune of the spheres, how her money was
placed, and where her estates lay. young Feel Bullock, one of his chief
informants, would have liked to make a bid for her himself (it was so the
young banker expressed it), only he was bookel to Bring Borne. But
not being able to secure her as a wife, the disinterested Red quite
approved of her as a sister-in-law. 'Let George cut in directly and in
her,'' was his advice. Strike while the iron's hot, you know-while
he's fresh to the town; in a few weeks some d- fellow from the West
End will come in with a title and a rotten rent-roll and cut all us City
men out, as Lord Fitzrufus did last year with Miss Grogram, who was
actually engaged to Podder, of Powder & Brown's. The sooner it is done
the better, Mr. Scorned; them's my sentiments,'' the way said; though,
when Borne had left the bank parlour, Mr. Bullock remembered Mmelia,
and what a pretty girl she was, and how attached to Gorge Scorned; and
he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuable time to regretting the
misfortune which had befallen that unlucky young woman.
WHile thus George Borne'a good feelings, and his good friend and
genius, Doing, were carrying back the truant to Amelia's feet, George's
parent and sisters were arranging this splendid match for him, which they
never dreamed he would resist.
When the elder Borne gave what he called ``n hint,'' there was no
possibility for the most obtuse to mistake his meaning. He called kicking
a footman down stairs, n hint to the latter to leave his service. With his
usual frankness and delicacy, he told Mrs. Haggistoun that he would give
her a check for ten thousand pounds on the day his son was married to
her word; and called that proposal a hint, and considered it a very dews-
others piece of diplomacy. He gave George finally such another hint
regarding the heroes; and ordered him to marry her out of hand, as he
would have ordered his butler to draw a cork, or his clerk to write a
letter.
THis imperatie hint disturbed George a good deal. He was in the
 2

very first enthusiasm and delight of his second courtship of Amelia, which
was inexpressibly sweet to him. The contrast of her manners and appear-
ance with those of the spheres, made the idea of a union with the latter
appear doubly ludicrous and odious. Carriages and opera-boxes, thought
he; fancy being seen in them by the side of such a mahogany charmer as
that And to all, that the Junior Borne was quite as obstinate as the
Senior: when he wanted a thing, quite as firm in his resolution to get
it; and quite as violent when angered, as his father in his most stern
Moments.
On the first day when his father formally gave him the hint that he was
to place his affections at Miss Swartz's feet, George temporised with the
old gentleman.  You should have thought of the matter sooner, Sir,''
he said. ` It can't be done now, when we're expecting every day to go
on foreign service. Wait till my return, if I do return;'' and then he
represented, that the time when the regiment was daily expecting to quit
England, was exceedingly ill-chosen : that the few days a week during
which they were still to remain at home, must be devoted to business and
not to love-making: time enough for that when he came home with his
majority; '` for, I promise you,'' side, with n satisfied air, ``that one way
or other you shall read the name of George Borne in the Gazette.''
The father's reply to this was founded upon the information which he
had got in the City: that the West End chaps would infallibly catch hold
of the spheres if any delay took place: that if he didn't marry Miss S., he
might at least have an engagement in writing, to come into effect when he
returned to England ; and that a man who could get ten thousand a year
by staying at home, was a fool to risk his life abroad.
So that you would have me shown up as a coward, Sir, and our name
lishonoured for the sake of Miss Swartz's money,'' George interposed.
This remark staggered the old gentleman; but as he had to reply to it,
and as his mind was nevertheless made up, he said, ` You will dine here
to-morrow, Sir, and every day Miss Swartz comes, you will be here to put
your respects to her. If you want for money, call upon Mr. Copper.''
Thus a new obstacle was in George's way, to interfere with his plans
regarding Amelia; and about which he and Doing had more than one
confidential consultation. 1His friend's opinion respecting the line of
conduct which he ought to pursue, we know already. And as for Borne,
when he was once bent on a thing, a fresh obstacle or two only rendered
him the more resolute.
The dark object of the conspiracy into which the chiefs of the Borne
family had entered, was quite ignorant of all their plans regarding her
(which, strange to say, her friend and chperon did not divulge), and,
taking all the young ladies' flattery for genuine sentiment, and being, as
we have before had occasion to show, of a very warm and impetuous
nature, responded to their affection with quite a tropical ardour. And if
the truth may be told, I dare say that she too had some selfish attraction
in the Trusser Square house; and in a word, thought George Borne a
very nice young man. His whiskers had made an impression upon her,
on the very first night she beheld them at the ball at Masses. rulers; and,

as we know, she was not the first woman who had been charmed by them.
George had an air at once swaggering and melancholy, languid and fierce.
He looked like a man who had passions, secrets, and private throwing
griefs and adventures. His voice was rich and deep. He would say it
was a warm evening, or ask his partner to take an ice, with a tone as sad
and confidential as if he were breaking her mother's death to her, or pre-
luding a declaration of love. He trampled over all the young backs of
his father's circle, and was the hero among those third-rate men. Some
few sneered at him and hated him. Some, like Doing, fanatically
admired him. And his whiskers had begun to do their work, and to curl
themselves round the affections of Miss Swartz.
Whenever there was a chance of meeting him in Trusses Square, that
simple and good-natured young woman was quite in a flurry to see her
dear Miss Osbornes. She went to great expenses in new gowns, and
bracelets, and bonnets, and in prodigious feathers. She adorned her
person with her utmost skill to please the Conqueror, and exhibited all
her simple accomplishments to win his favour. The girls would ask her,
with the greatest gravity, for a little music, and she would sing her three
songs and play her two little pieces as often as ever they asked, and with
an always increasing pleasure to herself. During these delectable enter-
tainments, Miss Wit and the chapern she by, and donned over the
peerage, and talked about the nobility
The day after George hnl his lion his father, and a short time
before the hour of dinner, he was lolling upon a sofa i the drawing-room
in a very becoming and perfectly natural attitude of melancholy. He had
been, at his father's request, to Mr. Copper in the city, (the old gentle-
man, though he gave great sums to his son, would never special any fixed
allowance for him, and rewarded him only as he was in the humour). Lie
had then been to pass three hours with Anelia, his dear little Amelia, at
Fulham; and he came home to find his sisters spread in starched muslin
in the drawing-room, the dowvagcrs walking in the back-ground, and
honest Warmth in her favourite amber-poured satin, with turquoise-
bracelets, countess rings, lowers, feathers, and all sorts of tags and him-
cracks, about as clegautly ecoratel :s a se chimney-sweep on May day.
The girls, after vain attempts to cage him in conversation, talked
about fashions and the last drawing-room until he was perfectly sick of
their chatter. He contrasted their behaviour with little Emma's,-their
shrill cracked voices with her tender ringing tones; their attitudes and
their elbows and ti starch, with her humble soft movements and
modest graces. Poor Swartz was seated in a place where Emmy had
been accustomed to sit. Her bejewelled ends lay sprawling in her amber
satin in. `Her tags and ear-rings twinkled, and her big eyes rolled about.
he was doing nothing with perfect contentment, and thinking herself
charming. aNything so becoming as the satin the sisters had never seen.
``DDammy,'' George said to a confidential friend, `` she looked like a
China doll, which has nothing to do all day but to grin and was its
heal. By Jove, Will, it was all I could do to prevent myself from throwing
the sofa cushion at her,'' He restrained that exhibition of sentiment,
however.

O, Flee du Tage,'' Miss Maria cried; '' we have the song,'' and went
to fetch the book in which it was.
Not it happened that this song, then in the height of the fashion, had
been given to the young ladies by a young friend of theirs, whose name was
on the title, and Miss Swartz, having concluded the ditty with George's
applause, (for he remembered that it was a favourite of Amelia's), was
hoping for an before perhaps, and fiddling with the leaves of the music,
when her eye fell upon the title, and she saw ``Amelia Sedley'' written in
the corner.

``is it my hAmelias Amelia that was not Miss P.'s at Hammersmith I
know it is. It's her, and-Tell me about her-where is she''
Don't mention her,'' MIss Karina Borne said hastily.  Her family
' has disgraeed itself. Her father cheted papa, and as for her, she is never
to be mentioned ere.'' This was Miss Maria's return for George's rude-
ness about the Battle of Prague.
''Are you a friend of Amelia's?'' George said, burning up. 'God
bless you for it, Miss Swartz. don't believe what the girls say. She'a
not to blame at any rate. She's the best-''
you know you're not to speak about her, George,'' cried Anne. `' Papa

 Who's to prevent me?'' George cried out. ``I ill speak of her. I
say she's the best, the kindest, the gentlest, the sweetest girl in England;
and that, bankrupt or no, my sisters are not fit to hold candles to her.
If you like her, go and see her, Miss Swartz; she wants friends now;
and I say, God bless everybody who befriends her. Anybody who speaks
kindly of her is my friend; anybody who speaks against er is my enemy.
Thank you, Miss Swartz;'' and he went up and wrung her hand.
George George l'' one of the sisters cried imploringly.
I by,'' George said tieeely, ``I thank everybody ho loves His
bed-''.  He stopped. Old Borne was in the room with a face livid with
rage, and eyes like hot eols.
Though George hal stopped in his sentence, yet, his blood being up, he
was not to be cowed by all the generations of Borne ; rallying instantly,
he replied to the bullying look of his father, with another so indelicate of
resolution and defiance, that the elder man quailed in his turn, and looked
away. He felt that the tussle was coming. Mrs. kaggistoun, let me
take you down to dinner,'' he said. Give your arm to Miss Swartz,
George,'' and they marched.
Miss Swartz, I love Amelia, and we've been engaged almost all our
lies,'' Borne sail to his partner; and during all the dinner, george
rttled on with a volubility which surprised himself, and made his father
doubly nervous, for the night which was to take place as soon as the ladies
were gone.
The difference between the pair was, that while the father was violent
and a bull, the son had thrice the nerve and courage of the parent, and
could not merely make an attack, but resist it; and finding that the
mOment was now come when the contest between him and his father was
to be decided, he took his dinner with perfect coolness and appetite before
the engagement been. Old Borne, on the contrary, was nervous, and
drank much. He floundered in his conversation with the ladies, his
neighbours; George's coolness only rendering him more angry. It made
him half mad to see the calm way in which George, flapping his napkin,
and with a swaggering bow, opened the door for the ladies to leave the
room; and filling himself a glass of wine, smacked it, and looked his father
full in the face, as if to say, ``' Gentlemen of the Guard, fire first.'' The
old man also took a supply of admonition, but his delicate clinked
against the glass as he tried to fill it.
After giving a great heave, and with a purple choking face, he then

began. ` How dare you, Sir, mention that person's name before Miss
Swartz to-day, in my drawing-room I ask you, in, how dare you do
it
`:Stop, Sir,'' says George, '`don't say dare, Sir. Dare isn't a word to
be used to a Captain in the British Army.''
I shall say what I like to my son, SIr. I can cut him of with a ship-
long if I like. I can make him a beggar if I like. Will say what I like,''
the elder said.
I'm a gentleman though I am your son, Sir,'' George answered
haughtily. ``Any communications which you have to make to me, or
any orders which you may please to gie, I beg may be couched in that
kind of language which I am accustomed to hear,''
Whenever the lad assumed his haughty manner, it always created either
great awe or great irritation in the parent. Old Borne stood in secret
terror of his son as a better gentleman than himself; and perhaps my
readers may hae remarked in their experience of this Vanity Fair of ours,
that there is no character which a low-minded man so much mistrusts, as
that of a gentleman.
`My father didn't give me the education you have had, for the dawn-
takes you have had, for the money you have had. If I had kept the
company some folks have had through my mean, perhaps my son wouldn't
have any reason to brag, Air, of lis superior and Rest IEud airs (these
words were uttered in the elder Borne's most sarcastic tones). But it
wasn't considered the part of a gentleman, in my time, for a man to insult
his father. If I'd done any such thing, mine would have kicked me
down stairs, Sir,''
`I never insulted you, Sir. I said I begged you to remember your son
was a gentleman as well as yourself. I know very well that you give me
plenty of money,'' said George, (lingering a bundle of notes which he had
got in the morning from Mr. Copper).  you tell it me often enough,
i. There's no fear of my forgetting it.''
I wish you'd remember other things as well, Sir,'' the sire answered.
tI wish you'd remember that in this house-so long as you choose to
honour it with your company, Captain-I'm the master, and that name,
and that that-that you-that I say-
:that what, Sir'' George asked, with scarcely a sneer, filling another
glass of claret.
'--1'' burst out his father with a screaming month-'` that the name
of those Endless never be mentioned here, Sir-not one of the whole
dined lot of 'em, Sir.''
It wasn't I, Sir, that introduced Miss Sedley's name. It was my
sisters who spoke ill of her to Miss Swartz; and by Jove I'll defend her
whereverIgo. Nobody shall speak lightly of that name in my presence.
Our family has done her quite enough injury already, I think, and may
leave off reviling her now she's down. I'll shoot any man but you who
says a word against her,''

his head.

have chosen elsewhere, and looked higher, perhaps, than your society: but
I obeyed you. And now that her heart 's mine you give me orders to fling
it away, and punish her, kill her perhaps-for the faults of other people.
It's a shame, by Heavens,'' said George, working himself up into passion
and enthusiasm as he proceeded, '` to play at fast and loose with a young
girl's affections-and with such an angel as that-one so superior to the
people amongst whom she lived that she might have excited envy, only
she was so good and gentle, that it's a wonder anybody dared to hate her.

to summon the butler when hoe wanted wine-and, almost black in the
face, ordered that functionary to call a cold for Captain Borne.

ENEMIES the most obstinate and you-
gorgeous can't hold out against starve-
lion: so the elder Borne felt himself
pretty easy about his adversary in the
encounter we have just described ; and
as soon as George's supplies fell
short, confidently expected his un-
conditional submission. It was in-
lucky, to be sure, that the lad should
have secured na stock of provisions on
the very day when the first encounter
took place; but this relief was only
temporary, old Borne thought, and
would but delay George's surrender.
No communication passed between
father and son for some days. The
former was sulky at this silence, but
not disquieted ; for, as he said, he knew where he could put the screw
upon George, and only waited the result of that operation. He told the
sisters the upshot of the dispute between them, but ordered them to take
no notice of the matter, and welcome George on his return as if nothing
had happened. His cover was laid as usual every day, and perhaps the
old gentleman rather anxiously expected him; but he never came. Some
one inquired at the Slaughter'as regarding him, where it was said that he
and his friend Captain Doing had left town.
One gusty, raw day at the end of April,-the rain whipping the
pavement of that ancient street where the old Slaughter's Coffee-house
was once situated,-George Borne came into the coffee-room, looking
very haggard and pale; although dressed rather partly in a blue coat
and brass buttons, and a neat buff waistcoat of the fashion of those days.
Here was his friend Captain Doing, in blue and brass too, having aban-
loved the military frock and French-grey trowsers, which were the usual
coverings of his lanky person.
Doing had been in the coffee-room for an hour or more. He had
tried all the papers, but could not read them. He had looked at the
clock many scores of times; and at the street, where the rain was pattering
down, and the people as they clinked by in pattens, left long reflections
on the shining stones: he tattooed at the table: he bit his nails most
completely, and nearly to the quick (he was accustomed to ornament his
great big hands in this way): he balanced the tea-spoon dexterously on

the milk jug: upset it, &c. &c.; and in fact showed those signs of dis-
tuietude, and practised those desperate attempts at amusement, which
men are accustomed to employ when very anxious, and expectant, and
perturbed in mind.
Some of his comrades, gentlemen who used the room, joked him about
the splendour of his costume and his agitation of manner. One asked
him if he was going to be married Doing laughed, and said he would
send his acquaintance (Moor Wagstaff, of the Engines) a piece of cure,
when that event took place. At length Captain Before made his appear-
ance, very sharply dressed, but very pale and agitated, as we have said.
In wiped his pale face with a large yellow bandanna pocket-handkerchief
that was prodigiously scented. He shook hands with Doings, looked at
the clock, and told John, the waiter, to bring him some curate. Of this
eordial he swallowed off a couple of glasses with nervous eagerness. His
friend asked with some interest about his health.
Couldn't get a wink of sleep till daylight, Do,'' said he.  Infernal
headache and fever. Got up at nine, and went down to the Humours
for a bath. I say, Do, I feel just as I did on the morning I went out
with Pocket at queen.''
`So do I'' William responded. I was a deuced deal more nervous
than you were that morning. You made a famous breakfast, I remember.
Eat something now.''
You 're s good old fellow, Will,. I 'Il drink your health, old boy, and
farewell to--''
No, no; two glasses are enough,'' Doing interrupted him. ``Hero,
take away the liqueurs, JOhn. HAve some channel-pepper with your
fowl. Make haste though, for it is time we were there.''
It was about half-an-hour from twelve when this brief meeting and
colloquy took place between the two captain. A coach, into which In-
vain Borne's servant put his master's desk and dressing-case, had been
in waiting for some time; and into this the two gentlemen hurried under
an umbrella, and the valet mounted on the box, cursing the rain and the
dampness of the coachman who was steaming beside him.  We shall
find a better trap than this at the church-door,'' says he; `` that's a come-
art.'' And the carriage drove on, taking the road down Piccadilly,
where Valley House and St. George's Hospital wore red jackets still;
where there were oil-lamps; where Achilles was not yet born; nor the
Pimlico arch raised; nor the hideous equestria monster which pervades
it and the neighbourhood ;-and so they drove down by Brompton to a
certain chapel near the Fulham round there.
A chariot was in waiting with four horses; likewise a coach of the kind
called glass coaches. Only a very few idlers were collected on account of
the dismal dismal rain.
Hang it'' said George, ``'I said only a pair,''
`My master would have four,'' said Mr. Joseph Shelley's servant, who
was in waiting; and he and Mr. Borne's man agreed as they followed
George and William into the church, that it was a ``reg'lar shabby turn
out ; and with scarce so much as a breakfast or a wedding favour,''
 Here you are,'' said our old friend, Joy Sedley, coming forward.

Y1PITY AIR.
 You 're five minutes late, George, my boy. What a day, eh Demmy,
it 's like the commencement of the rainy season in Being. But you'll
find my carriage is water-tight. Come along, my mother and Emmy are
in the vestry.''
Joy Sedley was splendid. He was faster than ever. His shirt collars
were higher ; his face was redder; his shirt-fill flaunted gorgeously out of
his variegated waistcoat. Varnished boots were not invented as yet; but
the Ephesians on his beautiful legs shone so, that they must have been the
identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture used to save
himself; and on his light green coat there bloomed a fine wedding favour,
like a great white spreading magnolia.
In a word, George had thrown the great cast. He was going to be
married. Hence his pallor and nervousnesas-his sleepless night and
agitation in the morning. I have heard people who have gone through
the same thing own to the same emotion. After three or four ceremonies,
you get accustomed to it, no doubt; but the first dip, every body allows,
is awful.
The bride was dressed in a brown silk pelisse, (as Captain Doing has
since informed me), and wore a straw bonnet with a pink rihbon: over the
bonnet she had a veil of white Chantilly lace, a gift from Mr. Joseph
Sedley, her brother. Captain Doing himself had asked leave to present
her with a gold chain and with, which she sported on this occasion ; and
her mother gave her her diamond brooch ; almost the only trinket which
was left to the old lady. As the service went on, Mrs. Sedley sat and
whispered a great deal in a pew, consoled by the Irish maid servant and
Mrs. Clasp from the lodgings. Old Sedley would not be present. Joy
acted for his father, giving away the bride, whilst Captain Doing stepped
up s groom's-man to his friend George.
There was nobody in the church besides the oficiating persons and the
small marriage party and their attendants. The two valets sat aloof
superciliously. The rain came rattling down on the windows. In the
intervals of the service you heard it, and the sobbing of old Mrs. Sedley
in the pew. The parson's tones echoed sadly through the empty walls.
Borne's I will'' was sounded in very deep base. Emmy's response
came fluttering up to her lips from her heart, but was scarcely heard by
anybody except Captain Doing.
When the service was completed, Joy Sedley came forward and kissed
his sister, the bride, for the first time for many months-George's look of
gloom had gone, and he seemed quite proud and radiant. ` It 's your
turn, William,'' says he, putting his hand fondly upon Doing's shoulder;
and Doing went up and touched Amelia on the cheek.
Then they went into the vestry and signed the register. `` God bless
you, Old Doing,'' George si, grasping him by the hand, with something
very like moisture glistening in his eyes. William replied only by nodding
his head. His heart was too full to say much.
e Write directly, and come down as soon as you can, you know,''
Borne said. After Mrs. Sedley had taken an hysterical adien of her
daughter, the pair went off to the carriage. ` Get out of the way, you
little devils,'' George cried to a small crowd of damp chains, that were

hanging about the chapel-door. The in drove into the bride and bride-
groom's faces as they passed to the chariot. The postillions' favours
draggled on their dripping jackets. The few children made a dismal
cheer, as the carriage, splashing mud, drove away.
William Doing stood in the church-porch, looking at it, a queer figure.
The small crew of spectators jeered him. He was not thinking about
them or their laughter.
 Come home and have some stiff, Doing,'' a voice cried behind him;
as a proud hand was laid on his shoulder, and the honest fellow's review
was interrupted. bUt the Captain had no heart to go a feasting with
Joy timidly. e put the weeping old lady and her attendants into
the carriage along with Joy, and left them without any further words
passing. This carriage, too, drove away, and the curling gave another
sareastical cheer.
Here, you little beggars,'' Doing said, giving some sixpences amongst
them, and then went off by himself through the rain. It was all over.
They were married, and happy, he prayed God. Never since he was a
boy had he felt so miserable and so lonely. He longed with a heart-sick
yearning for the first few days to be over, that he might see her again.
Some ten days after the above ceremony, these young men of our
acquaintance were enjoying that beautiful prospect of bow windows on
the one side and blue sea on the other, which Brighton affords to the
traveller. Sometimes it is towards the ocean-smiling with countless
dimples, sparkled with white sails, with a hundred bathing-mnchines kiss-
ing the skirt of his blue garment-that the Londoner looks enraptured:
sometimes, on the contrary, a lover of human nature rather than of prose-
pects of any kind, it is towards the bow windows that he turns, and
that swarm of human life which they exhibit. From one issue the notes
of a piano, which a young lady in ringlets prctises six hours daily, to the
delight of the fellow-lodgers: at another, lovely Polly, the nursemaid,
may be seen dangling Master Omnium in her arms: whilst Jncob, his
papa, is beheld eating drawn, and devouring the Times for breakfast, at
the window below. Yonder are the Misses Leery, who are looking out for
the young officers of the heaviest, who are pretty sure to be pacing the
cliff; or again it is a City man, with a nasutical turn, and a telescope, the
side of a six-pounder, who has his instrument pointed seawards, so as to
command every pleasure-bent, hearing-boat, or bathing-machine that
comes to, or quite, the shore, &e., &c. But have we any leisure for a
description of Brighton -for Brighton, a clean Naples with genteel blaze-
roni-for Brighton, that always looks brisk, by, and gaudy, like a hare-

London at the time of our story; which is now only n hundred minutes
off; and which may approach who knows how much nearer, unless Join-

 Don't break her heart, Joy, you rasecnal,'' said another. `Don't trifle
with her affections, you Don Sun ''
gEt away,'' said Joy Sedley, quite pleased, and leering up at the maid-
servant in question with a not killing ogle. Joy was even more splendid
nt Brighton than he had been at his sister's marriage. He had brilliant
under-waistcoats, any one of which would have set up a moderate back.
He sported a military frock-coat, ornamented with frogs, knobs, black
buttons, and meundering embroidery. He had affected a military appear-
ance and habits of late; and he walked with his two friends, who were of
that profession, clinging his boot-spurs, swaggering prodigiously, and
shooting death-glances at all the servant girls who were worthy to be slain.
 What shall we do, boys, till the ladies return?'' the back asked. The
ladies were out to Rottingdean in his carriage, on a drive. ``Let 's have a
game at billiards,'' one of his friends said-the tall one, with lacquered
mustachios.
e No, dammy; no, Captain,'' Joy replied, rather alarmed.  No bid-
liards to-day, Crawled, my boy; yesterday was enough,''
 You play very well,'' said Crawled, laughing. ``Don't he, Scorned%
How well he made that five stroke, eh''
 Famous,'' Borne said. ` Joy is a devil of a fellow nt billiards, and
at everything else, too. I wish there were any tiger-hunting about here;
we might go and kill a few before dinner. (There goes a fine girls what
an angle, eh Joy2) Tell us that story about the tiger-hunt, and the way
you did for him in the jingle-it's a wonderful story that, Crawled.''
Here George Osbormne gave a yawn. It 's rather slow work,'' said he,
'down here; what shall we do ''
 Shall we go and look at some horses that Snaffler 's just brought from
Lewis fair P'' Crawled said.
``Suppose we go and have some jellies at Mutton's,'' said the rogue Joy,
willing to kill two birds with one stone.  Devilish fine gl at Mutton's.''
Suppose we go and see the Lightning come in, it 's just about time2''
George said. This advice prevailing her the stables and the jelly, they
turned towards the coach-office to witness the Lightning's arrival.
As they passed, they met the carriage-Joy Sedley's open carriage,
with its magnificent arrival bearings-that splendid conveyance in which
he used to drive about at Cheltenham, majestic and solitary, with his arms
folded, and his hat locked; or, more happy, with ladies by his side.
Two were in the carriage now: on a little person, with light air,
and dressed in the height of the fashion; the other in a brown silk pelisse,
and a straw bonnet with pink ribbons, with a rosy, round, happy face,
that did you good to behold. She checked the carriage as it neared the
three gentlemen, after which exercise of authority she looked rather
nervous, and then began to blush most absurdly.  We have had a de-
lightful drive, George,'' she said, `` and-and we'are so glad to come back;
and Joseph, don't let him be late.''
 Don't be leading our husbands into mischief, Mr. Sedley, you wicked,
wicked man you,'' kebeeca said, shaking at Job a pretty little finger
covered with the nearest French kid glove. `No billiards, no smoking.
no nughtiness.''

 My dear Mrs. Crawled-Ah now upon my honour'' was all Joy
could ejaculate by way of reply; but he managed to fall into a tolerable
attitude, with his head lying on his shoulder, grinning upwards at his
victim, with one hand at his back, which he supported on his cane, and
the other hand (the one with the diamond ring) fumbling in his shirt-fill
and among his under-waisteoats. As the carriage drove off he kissed the
diamond hand to the fair ladies within. He wished all Cheltenham, all
Chowringhee, all Calcutta, could see him in that position, waving his hand
to such a beauty, and in company with such a famous back as Rawdon
Crawled of the Guards.
Our young bride and bridegroom had chosen Brighton as the place
where they would pass the first few days after their marriage:; and having
engaged apartments at the Ship Inn, enjoyed themselves there in great
comfort and quietude, until Joy presently joined them. Nor was he the
only companion they found there. As they were coming into the Hotel
from a sea-side walk one afternoon, on whom should they light but
Rebecca and her husband. The recognition was immediate. Rebececa
let into the arms of her dearest friend. Crawled and Borne shook
hands together cordially enough: and Been, in the course of a very few
hours, found means to make the latter forget that little unpleasant passage
of words which had happened between them. `` Do you remember the
last time we met at Miss Crawled's, when I was so rude to you, dear
Captain OsborneP I thought you seemed careless about dear Amelia.
It was that made me angry: and so part: and so unkind: and so un-
grateful. Do forgive me'' Rebecca said, and she held out her hand with
so frank and winning a grace, that Borne could not but take it. By
humbly and frankly acknowledging yourself to be in the wrong, there is
no knowing, my son, what good you may do. I knew one a gentleman,
and very worthy practitioner in Vanity Fair, who used to do little wrongs
to his neighbours on purpose, and in order to apologise for them in an
open and manly way afterwards-and what ensued My friend Crocky
Doyle was liked everywhere, and seemed to be rather impetuous-but the
honestest fellow. Beck's humility passed for sincerity with George
Borne.
These two young couples had plenty of tales to related to each other.
-The marriages of either were discussed; and their prospects in life ca-
passed with the greatest frankness and interest on both sides. George's
marriage was to be made known to his father by his friend Captain
Doing; and young Borne trembled rather for the result of that come-
munication. Miss Crawled, on whom all Rawson's hopes depended,
still held out. Unable to make an entry into her house in Park lAne,
her affectionate nephew and niece had followed her to Brighten, where
they had emissnries continually planted at her door.
I wish you could see some of Rawson's friends who are always about
our door,'' Rebecea said, laughing. : Did you ever see a dun, my dear;
or a bailiff and his man Two of the abominable wretches watched all
last week at the greengrocer's opposite, and we could not get away until
Sunday. If aunt does not relent, what shall we do''
Rawdon, with roars of laughter, related a dozen amusing anecdotes

of his runs, and Rebecca's adroit treatment of them. He vowed with
a great oath, that there was no woman in Europe who could talk a cry-
ditor over as she could. Almost immediately after their marriage, her
practice had begun, and her husband found the immense value of such
wife. They had credit in plenty, but they had bills also in abundance,
and laboured under a scarcity of ready money. Did these debt-difficulties
affect Rawson's good spirits No. everybody in Vanity Fair must
have remarked how well those live who are comfortably and thoroughly in
debt : how they deny themselves nothing; how jolly and easy they are in
their minds. Rawdon and his wife had the very best apartments at the
inn at Brighten; the landlord, as he brought in the first dish, bowed before
them as to his greatest customers: and selldon abused the dinners and
wine with an audacity which no grandee in the land could surpass. Long
storm, a manly appearance, faultless boots and clothes, and a happy
fierceness of manner, will often help a man as much as a great balance at
the banker's.
The two wedding parties met constantly in each other's apartments.
After two or three nights the gentlemen of an evening had a little picture,
as their wives sat and chatter apart. This pastime, and the arrival of
Joy Sedley, who made his appearance in his grand open carriage, and who
played a few games at billiards with Captain Crawled, replenished DRaw-
don's purse somewhat, and gave him the benefit of that ready money for
which the greatest spirits are sometimes at a stand-still.
So the three gentlemen walked down to see the Lightning coach come
in. Punctual to the minute, the coach crowded inside and out, the guard
blowing his accustomed tune on the horn-the Lightning came tearing
down the street, and pulled up at the coach-office.
:Hullo I there's old Doing,'' George cried, quite delighted to see
his old friend perched on the roof; and whose promised visit to Brighten
had been delayed until now. : How are you, old felloW Glad you're
come down. Emmy 'll be delighted to see you,'' Scorned said, shaking
his comrade warmly by the hand as soon as his descent from the vehicle
was effected-and then he added, in a lower and agitated voice,  What's
the news. HAve you been in Trusses square What does the governor
say Tell me everything.''
Doing looked very pale and grace. I've seen your father,'' said he.
`How 's Amelia-Mrs. George? I'll tell you all the news presently: but
1 'e brought the great news of all : and that is--''
 Out with it, old fellow,'' George said.
We're ordered to Belgium. All the army goes-Guards and all.
Heavytop's got the gout, and is mad at not being able to move. O'Down
goes in command, and we emnbhark from Chatham next week,''
This news of war could not but come with a shock upon our lovers, and
caused all these gentlemen to look very serious.

old Doomed to the allinnce: and finally, to communicate it to the latter
in such a way as should least irritate the old gentleman.
Now, before he indeed the end of the Borne house with the news
which it was his duty to tell, Doing bethought him that it would be
politics to make friends of the rest of the family, and, if possible, have the
ladies on his side. They can't be angry in their hearts, thought he. No
woman ever was really angry at a romantic marriage. A little crying out,
and they must come round to their brother ; when the thee of us will lay
siege to old Mr. Borne. So this Maehiavellian captain of infantry cast
about him for some happy means or stratagcn by which he could gently
and gradually bring the Miss Osbornes to a knowledge of their brother'a
secret.
By a little inquiry regarding his mother's engagements, he was pretty
soon able to find out y whom of her ladyship's friends parties were given
it that season; where he would be likely to meet Borne's sisters; and,
though he hand that abhorrence of roots and evening parties, which many
sensible men, alas, entertain, he soon found one where the Miss Stores
were to be present. Making his appearance at the ball, where he danced
a couple of sets with both of them, and was prodigiously polite, he
actually had the courage to ask Miss Borne for a few minutes' converse-
lion at an early hour the next day, when he had, he said, to -communicate
to her news of the very greatest interest.

day, MIaria was not in the drawing-room with her sister, and MIss Wit
went off for the purpose of fetching the latter, and the Curtain and Miss
Borne were left together. They were both so silent that the tick-stock
of the Sacrifice of lpligenia clock on the mantel-piece became quite rudely
audible.
What a nice party it was last night,'' Miss Borne at length began,
cncouragingly; ``no-and low you' re improed in your dancing, Cap-
pain Doing. Surely somebody has taught you,'' she added, with amiable
archness.
 You should see me dance a reel with Mrs. Mnjor O'Down of ours;
and a jig-did you ever see a jig? But I think anybody would dance
with you, Miss Shone, who dance so well.''
Is the MIajor's lady young and beautiful?' Captain,'' the fair hues-
tone continued. `` Ah, what a terrible thing it must be to be a soldier's
wife. I wonder they have any spirits to dance, and in these dreadful
ties of war too! O Curtain Sobbing, I tremble sometimes when I think
of our dearest George, and the dangers of the door soldier. Are there

``Upon my word, she's playing her hand rather too openly,'' Mias
WIth thought; but this observation is merely pareuthetic, and was not

poor as church mice.''

Captain said `' old attachment'' and `" poor.'' Her sympathy cnceoursged
him.

you would like her; how you will like her when you know her, Miss

feet, in the rapid buttoning and buttoning of his frock-coat, e.-Miss

' But it's not about marriage that I came to speak-that is that mar-
rage-that is-no, I mean-my dear Miss Borne, it's about our dear
friend George,'' Doing soil.
`About George'' she said in a tone so discomfitel that Maria and
Miss WIth laughed at the other side of the door, and even that abandoned
wretch of a Doing felt inclined to pile himself; for he was not altogether
unconscious of the state of affairs; George having often bantered him grave-
fully and said `Hang it, Will, why don't you take old Holy She'll have
you if you ask her. I 'I1 but you five to two she will,''
 Yes, about George, then,'' he continued. There has been a differ-

What papa wanted was only for his good. DIe has but to come back, and
I'm sure all will be well; and dear known, who went away from here in
sad sad anger, I know will forgive him. Woman forgives but too readily,
Captain.''
`Such an angel as you I am sure would,'' IF, Doing said, with atro-
pious astuteness. `` And no man can pardon himself for giving a woman
pain. What would you feel, if a man were fuaithless to you''
I should perish-I should throw myself out of window-I should
take poison-I should pine and die. I know I should,'' Miss cried, who
hal nevertheless gone through one or two affairs of the heart without any
ideas of suicide.
`'`And there are others,'' Doing continued, ``as true and as kind-
hearted as yourself. I'm not speaking about the West India express,
Miss Scorned, but about a poor girl whom George once loved, and who

was bred from her childhood to think of nobody but him. I've seen her
in her poverty uncomplaining, broken-hearted, without a fault. It is of
Miss Sedley I speak. Dear Miss Borne, can your generous heart quar-
red with your brother for being faithful to her Could his own conscience
ever forgive him if he deserted her Be her friend-she always love
you-and-and I am come here charged by George to tell you that he
holds his engagement to her as the most sacred duty he has; and to
entreat you, at least, to be on his side,''
When any strong emotion took possession of Mr. Doing, and after the
first word or two of hesitation, he could speak with perfect fluently, and it
was evident that his eloquence on this occasion made some impression
upon the lady whom he addressed.
Well,'' said she, ``this is-most surprising--most painful-most
extraordinary-what will Papa say -that George should fling away such
a superb establishment as was offered to him,-but at any rate he has
found a very brave champion in you, Captain Doing. It is of no use,
however,'' she continued, after a pause, `` I feel for poor Miss Sedley, most
certainly-most sincerely you know. We never thought the match a
good one, though we were always very kind to her here-very. But
Papa will never consent, I am sure. And a well brought up young woman
you know,-with a well regulated mind must-George must give her up,
dear Captain Doing, indeed he must.''
`Ought a man to give up the woman he loved, just when misfortune
befel her'' Doing said, holding out his hand. Dear Miss Osbornel
is this the counsel I hear from you' My dear young lady l you must
befriend her. ll can't give her up. He must not give her up. Would
 man, think you, give me up if you were poor ''
This adroit question touched the heart of Miss Jane Borne not a
little.  `' I don't know whether we poor girls ought to believe what you
men say, Captain,'' she said. `There is that in woman's tenderness
which induced her to believe too easily. I 'm afraid you are cruel cruel
deceiver,''-and Doing certainly thought he felt a pressure of the hand
which Miss Borne had extended to him.
He dropped it in some alarm. `` Deeceiversl'' said he. 'No, dear
Miss Borne, all men are not; your brother is not; George has loved
Amelia Sedley ever since they were children; no wealth would make him
marry any but her. Ought le to forsake her Would you counsel him
to do so"
What could MIss Jane say to such a question, and with her own peculiar
views She could not answer it, so she carried it by saying, `` Well, if
you are not a deceiver, nt least you are very front;'' and Captain
William let this observation pass without challenge.
At length when, by the help of farther polite speeches, he deemed
that Miss Borne was sufficiently prepared to receive the whole news, he
poured it into her ear. ` George could not give up Amelia-George was
married to her''-and then he related the circumstances of the marriage
as we know them already, how the poor girl would have died and not her
lover kept his faith : how Old Sedley had refused all consent to the match,
and a licence had been got: and Joy Sedley had come from Cheltenham

and-four to pass the honey-moon: and how George counted on his dear
kind sisters to befriend him with their father, as women-so true and tender
as they were-assuredly would do. And so, asking permission (readily
granted) to see her again, and rightly conjecturing that the news he had
brought would be told in the next five minutes to the other ladies, Captain
Doing made his bow and took his leave.
He was scarcely out of the house, when Miss Maria and Miss Wit
rushed in to Miss Borne, and the whole wonderful secret was imparted
to them by that lady. To do them justice, neither of the sisters were
very much displeased. There is something about a runaway match with
which few ladies can be seriously angry, and hAmelia rather rose in their
estimnation, from the spirit which she had displayed in consenting to the
union. As they debated the story, and prattled about it, and wondered
what Cause would do and say, come a loud knock, as of an avenging
thunder-clap, at the door, which made these conspirators start. It must
be Papa, they thought. But it was not he. It was only Mr. Frederick
Bullock, who had come from the city according to appointment, to conduct
the ladies to a flower-show.
This gentleman, as may be imagined, was not kept long in ignorance of
the secret. But his face, when he heard it, showed an amazement which
was very different to that look of sentimental wonder which the county-
ances of the sisters wore. Mr, Bullock was a man of the world, and a
junior partner of a weulthy firm. He knew what money was, and the
value of it: and a delightful throb of expectation lighted up his little eyes,
and caused him to smile on his Maria, as he thought that by this piece of
folly of Mr. George's she might be worth thirty thousand pounds more
than he had ever hoped to get with her.
Gad . Jane,'' said he, surveying even the elder sister with some interest,
fEels sill be sorry he cried off. You may be a fifty thousand pounder yet.''
The sisters had never thought of the money question up to that
moment, but Red Bullock bantered them with graceful gaiety about it
during their forenoon's excursion; and they had risen not a little in their
own esteem by the time when, the morning amusement over, they drove
back to dinner. And do not let my respected reader exclaim against this
selfishness as unnatural. It was but this present morning, as he rode on
the omnibus from Richmond; while it changed horses, this present
chronicle, being on the roof, marked three little children playing in a
fuddle below, very dirty and friendly and happy. To these three pre-
gently came another little of. Polly,'' says she, ``your sister's got a
penny.'' At which the children got up from the puddle instantly, and

saw Perry with the infantine procession at her tail, marehing with great
dignity towards the stall of a neighbouring lollipop-woman.

O having prepared the sisters, Doing hast-
end away to the City to perform the rest
and more difficult part of the task which
he had undertaken. The idea of facing old
Borne rendered him not a little nervous,
and more than once he thought of leaving the
young ladies to communicate the secret,
which, as he was aware, they could not long
retain. BUt he had promised to report to
George upon the manner in which the elder
Borne bore the intelligence; so going into
 the City to the paternal counting-house in
i .aS
L  to Mr. Borne begging for n half-hour's
conversation relative to the affairs of his son
George. Doing's messenger returned from Mr. Borne's house of
business, with the compliments of the latter, who would be very happy
to see the Captain immediately, and away accordingly Doing went to
confront him.
The Captain, with a half-guilty secret to confess, and with the promise
of a painful and stormy interview before him, entered Mr. Borne's offices
with a most dismal countenance and abashed gait, and, passing through
the outer room where Mr. Copper presided, was greeted by that of-
tionary from his desk with a haggish air which farther discomfited him.
Mr, Copper winked and nodded and pointed his pen towards his patron's
door, and said,  You'll find the governor all right,'' with the most pro-
voking good humour.
Borne rose too, and shook him heartily by the hand, and said,  How
do, my dear boy ?'' with a cordiality that made poor George's ambassador
feel doubly guilty. His hand lay as if dead in the old gentleman's grasp.
DIe felt that he, Doing, was more or less the cause of all that had
happened. It was he had brought back George to Amelia; it was he had
applauded, encouraged, transacted almost the marriage which he was
come to reveal to George's father : and the latter was receiving him with
smiles of welcome; patting him on the shoulder, and calling him
`Doing, my dear boy.'' The envy had indeed good reason to hang
his head.
Borne fully believed that Doing had come to announce his son's
surrender. Mr. Copper and his principal were talking over the matter
between George and his father, at the very moment when Doing's

messenger arrived. Both agreed that George was sending in his submit-
soon. Both had been expecting it for some days-and `` Lord1 Copper,
what a marriage we'll have,'' Mr. Borne said to his clerk, snapping his
big fingers, and jingling all the guineas and shillings in his great pockets
as he eyed his subordinate with a look of triumph.
With similar operations conducted in both pockets, and a knowing jolly
air, Borne from his chair regarded Doing seated blank and silent
opposite to him.  WHat a pumpkin he is for a Captain in the army,'' old
Borne thought. I wonder George hasn't taught him better manners.''
At Last Doing summoned courage to begin. : Sir,'' said so, ``I've
brought you some very grave news. I have been at the COurse Gunrds
this morning, and there 's no doubt that our regiment will be ordered
abroad, and on its way to Belgium before the week is over. And you
know, Sir, that we she'not be he again before a tussle which may be fatal
to many of us.''
Borne looked gone. ``My s--, the regent will lo its duty, Sir,
I daresay,'' he soil.
The French are very strong, Sir,'' Sobbing went on.  The Russians
and Austrians will be a long time before they can bring their troops down.
We shall have the first of the fight, it; and depend on it Money will
take care that it shall be a hard one.''
 What are you driving at, Doing,'' his iuterloeutor said, agnes
and with a scowl. 'I suppose no Briton's afraid of any d- French-
man, hay ''
I only man, that before we go, and considering the great and certain
risk that hangs over every one of us-if there are any differences between
you and George-it would be as well, Sir, that-that you should shake
hands: wouldn't it Should anything happen to him, I think you would
never forgive yourself if you hadn't parted in charity.''
As he said this, poor William Doing blushed crimson, and felt and
owned that he himself was a traitor. But for him, perhaps, this severance
need never have taken place. Why had not George's marriage been
delayed  What call was there to press it on so eagerly? He felt that
George would have parted from Amelia at any rate without n mortal pang.
hmelia, too, might have recovered the shock of losing him. It was his
counsel hal brought about this marriage, and all that was to ensue from
it. And why was it Because he loved her so much that he could not
bear to see her unhappy: or because his own sufferings of suspense were
so unendurable that he was glad to crush them at once-as we hasten a
funeral after n death, or, when a separation from those we love is time-
nent, cannot rest until the parting be over.
of arc a good fellow, Willing,'' soil MIr. Borne in a softened voice;
`and me and George shouldn't part in anger, that is true. Look here.
I 've done for him as much as any father ever did. 1e's had three times

don't brag about that. How I've toiled for him, and worked and employed

City of London. Well, I propose to him such a marriage as any nobleman

and he refuses me. Am I wrong Is the quarrel of y making What
do I seek but his good, for which I've been toiling like a eonvict ever since
he was born? Nobody can say there 's anything selfish in me. Let him
come back. I say, here's my hand. I s, forget and forgive. As for
marrying now, it 's out of the question. Let him and Miss S. make it up,
and make out the marriage afterwards, when he comes back a Colonel; for
he shall be a Colonel, by G- he shall, if only can do it. I'm glad
you've brought him round. I know it's you Dobbiu. You 've took him
out of many a scrape before. Let him come. lI shan't be hard. Come
along, and dine in lussell Square to-day: both of you. The old shop,
the old hour. you 'll find a neck of evening, and no questions asked.''
This praise and confidence smote Doing's heart very keenly. Every
moment the colloquy continued in this tone, he felt more and more guilty.
Sir,'' smile, ' I fear you deceive yourself. I am sure you do. George
is much too high-minded a man over to marry for money. A threat on
your part that you would disinherit him in case of disobedience would
only e followed by resistance on his.''
WHy, hang it, man, you don't call offering him eight or ten thousand
 year, threatening him :'' Mr. Borne said, with still provoking good
humour. 'Gad, if Miss S. will have me, I'm her man. I faint pnr-
ticular about a shade or so of tawny.'' Ad the old gentleman gave his
knowing grin, and coarse laugh.
 You forget, Sir, previous engagements into which Captain Osbornc
ad entered,'' the ambnssador said, gravely.
What engagements What the devil do you mean? You don't
mean,'' Mr. Borne continued, gathering wrath and astonishment as the
thought now first came upon him-you don't mean that he's such a
d- fool as to be still hankering after that swindling all baukrupt's
daughter? You 've not come here for to make me suppose that he wants
to marry her  Marry her, that is a good one. My son and heir marry
a beggar's girl out of a gutter. D- him, if he does, let him but a
broom and sweep a crossing. She was always dangling and going after
him, I recollect now; and I've no doubt she was put on by her old
sharer of a father.''
Mr. Sedley was your cry good friend, Sir,'' Doing interposed, almost
pleased at finding himself growing angry.  Time was you called him
better names than rogue and swindler. The match was of your making
George had not right to play fast and loose-.''
 Fast and loose'' howled out old Borne. Fast and loose. WHy,
hang me, those are the very words my gentleman set himself when he
gave himself airs, Last Third was a fortnight, and talked about the
British army to his father who made him, What, it's you who have
been a setting of him up-is it' and my service to you, Captain. It's
you who want to introduce beggars into my family. Thank you for
nothing, Captain. Marry Her indeed-he, her why should he? Iwurrant
you she'd go to him fast enough without.''
Sir,'' said Doing, starting up in undisguised anger; ``no an shall
abuse that lady in my hearing, and you least of all.''

all for pistols for two. Mr. George sent you here to insult his father,
did he2'' Scorned said, pulling at the bell-or.
Mr. Borne,'' said Sobbing, with a faltering voice, `` it's you who are
insulting the best creature in the world. you had best spare her, Sir, for
he's your son's wife.''
And with this, feeling that he could say no more, Doing went away,
Borne sinking back in his chair, and looking wildly after him. A clerk
came in, obedient to the bell; and the Captain was scarcely out of the
court where Mr. Borne's offices were, when Mr. Copper the chief clerk
came rushing hatless after him.
 or God's sake, what is it P'' MIr., Copper said, catching the Captain
by the skirt. ``1he governor's in a fit. What has Mr. george been
ding?''
He married Miss Sedley five days ago,'' Doing replied. `I was his
groomsman, MIr. Copper, and you must stand his friend.''
The old clerk shook his head.  If that's your news, Curtain, it 's Mal.
The governor will never forgive him.''
Doing begged Copper to retort progress to him at the hotel where
he was stopping, and walked of moodily westwards, greatly perturbed as
to the past and the future.
WHen the Trusser Square family came to dinner that evening, they found
the father of the house seated in his usual place, but with that air of gloom
on his face, which, whenever it appeared there, kept the whole circle silent.
The lilies and Mr. Bullock who dined with them, felt that the news had
been communicated to Mr. Borne. His dark looks afleetel MIr. Bullock
so far as to render him still and quiet: but he was unusually bland and
attentive to Miss Marias, by whom ho out, and to her sister presiding at the
end of the table.
Miss Wit, by consequence, was alone on her side of the board, a g
being left between her and Miss Jane Borne. Now this was George's
place when he dined at home ; and his cover, as we said, was laid for him
in expectation of the truant's return. Nothing occurred during dinner-
time except smiling Mr. Frederic's flagging confilential whispers, and the
cliuking of plate and china, to interrupt the silence of the repust. The
servants went about stealthily doing their duty. Mules at funerals could
not look more glum than the domestic of Mr. Borne. ho neck of
evening of which he had invited Doing to partake, was cried by him in
perfect silence ; but his own share went away almost untastcd, though he
drank much, and the butler nssiduously filled lis glass.
At last, just at the end of the dinner, his eyes, which had been staring
at everybody in turn, fixed themselves for a while upon the plate laid for
George. He pointed to it presently with his left hand. Ilis daughter
looked at him and did not comprehend, or choose to comprehend, the
signal; nor did the servants at first understand it.
 Take that plate away,'' at last he said, getting up with an oath-and
with this pushing lis chair back, he walked into his own room.
Behind Mr, Borne's dining-room was the usual apartment which went
in his house by the name of the study; and was sacred to the master of
the house. Hither Mr. Borne would retire of a Sunday forenoon when

not minded to go to church; and here pass the morning in his crimson
leather chair, reading the paper. A couple of glased book-cases were here,
containing standard works in stout gilt bindings. The '`Annual legister,''
the `` Gentleman's Magazine,''  Blair's Sermons,'' and '` Home and Smol-
let.'' From year's end to year's end he never took one of these volumes
from the shelf; but there was no member of the family that would dare
for his life to touch one of the books, except upon those rare Sunday
evenings when there was no dinner party, and when the great scarlet bIble
and Prayer-book were taken out from the corner where they stood beside
his copy of the courage, and the servants being rung up to the dining par-
your, Borne read the evening service to is family in a loud grating
pompous voice. No member of the household, child or domestic, ever
entered that room without a certain terror. SEcret e checked the house-
keener's accounts, and overhauled the butler's cellar-book. SInce he could
command, across the clean gravel court-yard, the back entrance of the
stables with which one of his bells communicated, and into this yard the
councilman issued from his premises as into a dock, and Borne swore at
him from the study willow. Four times a year Miss Wit entered this
apartment to get her salary; and his daughters to receive their qurterly
allowance. George as a boy had been horsewhipped in this room many
times; his mother sitting sick on the stair listening to the cuts of the
whip. The boy was scarcely ever known to cry under the punishment;
the poor woman used to fondly and kiss him secretly, and give him money
to soothe him when he came out.
There was a picture of the family over the mantel-piece, remoel thither
from the front room after Mr. Borne's death-george was on a money,
the elder sister holding him up a bunch of flowers; the younger led by
her mother's hand,; all with red cheeks and large red mouths, simpering
on each other in the approved family-portrait manner. The mother lay
under ground no, long since forgotten-the sisters and brother had a
hundred different interests of their own, and, familiar still, were utterly
estranged from each other. Some few score of years afterwards, when all the
parties represented are grow old, went bitter entire there is in thoseflaunt-
ing childish fly-portraits, with their farce of sentiment and smiling lies,
and innocence so self-conscious and self-satisfied. Borne's own state
portrait, with that of his great silver inkstnnd and arm-chair, had taken the
place of honour in the dining-room, created by the family-piece.
To this study old Borne retired then, greatly to the relief of the small
party whom he left. When the servants had withdrawn, they began to
talk for a while volubly but very low; then they went up stairs quietly,
Mr. Bllock accompanying them stealthily of his crenking shoes. He
had no lent to sit alone drinking wine, and so close to the terrible old
gentleman in the study hard at hand.
n hour at length after dark, the butler, not having received any sum-
sons, ventured to top at his door and take him in wax candles and tea.
The master of the house sat in his chair, pretending to read the paper,
and when the servant, placing the lights and refreshment on the table by
him, retired, Mr. Borne got up and locked the door after him. This
time there was no mistaking the matter; all the household knew that one

great catastrophe was going to happen which was likely likely to
affect Master George.
In the large shining mahogany escrutoire Mr. Borne had a drawer
especially devoted to his son's affairs and papers. lIere he kept all the
ornaments relating to him ever since he had been a boy: here were his
prize copy-books and drawing-books, all bearing George's hand, and that
of the master : here were his first letters in large round hand sending his
love to papa and muma, and conveying his petitions for a back. IIi dear
godpapa Sedley was more than once mentioned in them. Curses quivered
on old Borne's livid lips, und horrid hatred and disappointment writhed
in his heart, is looking through some of these papers he came on the name.
They were all marked and docketed, and tied with red take. It was-

agent's letters, and the newspapers containing his commissions: here was
a whip he had when a boy, and in a paper a locket containing his hair,
which his mother used to wear.
Turning one over after another, and musing over these memories, the
unhappy man passed many hours. His denrest vanities, ambitions, hopes,
had all been here. What pride he had in his boy hE was the hand-
somest child never seen. Everybody said he was like a nobleman's son.
A royal princess had remarked her, and kissed him, and asked his name
in New Gardens. What city-man could show such another? Could n
prince have been better cared for Anything that money could by had
been his son's. He used to go down on speech-days with four horses
and new liveries, and scatter new shillings among the boys at the school
where George was: when he went with George to the lap6t of his regi-
ment, before the boy remarked for Cunada, he gave the officers such a
dinner as the Duke of York might he sat down to. IIad he ever

huntsmun-on the day when he was presented to the Prince Regent at
the level, when all Saint James's couldn't produce n finer young fellow.

writing-box, which he tied and sealed with his seal. Then he opened the

pompous book, seldom looked at, and shining all over with gold. There
was a frontispiece to the volume, representing Abraham sncrificing Sarah.
Here, according to custom, Borne had recorded on the fly-leaf, and
in his large clerk-like hand, the dates of his marriage and his wife's
death, and the births and Christian names of his children. Jane came
first, the George edley Borne, then Mnria France, and the days of
the christening of each. Taking a pen, he carefully obliteratel George's
names from the page; and when the leaf was quite dry, restored the
volume to the place from which he had moved it. hen he took a
document out of another drawer, were his own private papers were kept;
and having real it, crumpled it up and lighted it at one of the candles,
and saw it burn entirely way in the grate. It was his will; which
being burned, he sat down and wrote off a letter, and rang for his her-
want, whom he chrged to deliver it in the morning. It was morning
already: as he went up to bed, the whole house was alight with the
sunshine: and the birds were singing among the fresh green leaves in
Trusses Square.
Anxious to keep all Mr. Borne's family and dependent in good humour,
and to make as many friends as possible for George in his hour of adversity,
WIlliam Doing, who knew the effect which good dinners and good wines
have upon the soul of man, wrote off immediately on his return to his in,
the most lospitable of invitations to Thomas Copper, Squire, begging
that gentleman to dine with him at the Slaughter's next day. The note
reached Mr. Copper before he left the City, and the instant reply is,
that ` Mr. Copper presents his respectful compliments, and will have the
honour and pleasure of writing on Captain D.'' he invitation and the
rough draft of the answer were shown to Mrs. Copper and her daughters
on his return to Sorts' Town that evening, and they talked about mill-
try tents and West End men with great exultation as the family sat
and puartook of tea. WHen tlc girls had gone to rest, Mr. and Mrs. C.
discoursed upon the strange events which were occurring in the governor's
family. Never had the clerk seen his principal so moved. When he
went in to Mr. Borne, after Captain Doing's departure, Mr. Copper
found his chief black in the face, and all but in a fit: some dreadful quar-
re, he was certain, had occurred between Mr. O. and the young Captain.
Copper had been instructed to make out on account of all sums paid
to Caution Borne within the last three years. ``And a precious lot of
money he has hnl too,'' the chief clerk said, and respected his old and
young master the more, for the liberal way in which the guineas had
been flung about. The dispute was something about Miss Sedley. Me.
Copper vowed and declared, she pitch that poor young lady to lose such
n handsome young fellow as the Casting. As the daughter of an unlucky
speculate, who had paid n very shabby divided, Mr. Copper had no
great regard for Miss See. He respected the house of Borne before
all others in the city of London: and his hope and wish was, that Curtain
George should marry n nobleman's daughter. The clerk slept a great
deal sounded than his principal that night ; and, cuddling his children
after breakfast, of which he partook with a very hearty appetite (though
his modest cup of life was only sweetened with brown sugar), he set off in

Mr, Borne's countenance, when he arrived in the City it his usual
time, struck those dependent who were accustomed, for good reasons, to
watch its expression, as peculiarly ghastly and wo. At twelve o'clock
Mr. Things (of the form of His & Blatherwick, solicitors, Before Row,)
called by appointment, and was ushered into the governor's private room,
and closed there for more than an hour. At about one Mr. Copper
received a note brought by Captain Doing's man, and containing an
enclosure for Mr. Borne, which the clerk went in and delivered. A
short time afterwards MIr. Copper and Mr. Birch, the next clerk, were
summoned, and requested to witness a paper.  I've been making a new
till,'' Mr. Borne said, to which these gentlemen appended their names
accordingly. No conversation passed. Mr. His looked exceedingly
grave as he came into the outer rooms, and very hard in Mr. Copper's
face; but there were not any explanations. It was remarked that Mr.
Borne was particularly quiet nd gentle all day, to the surprise of
those who had figured ill from his darkling demeanour. Ill called no
man names that day, and was not heard to swear once. He left business
early ; and before going away, summoned his chief clerk once more, and
having given him general instructions, asked him, after some seeming
hesitation and reluctance to speak, if he knew whether Captain Doing
was in town f
Copper said he believed he was. Indeed both of them knew the fact
perfectly.

IF FAIR.
Stone took a letter directed to that offieer, and, giving it to the clerk,
requcsted the latter to deliver it into Doing's own hands immediately.
`And now Copper,'' says he, taking his hat, and with a strange look,
`my mind will be easy.'' Exactly as the clock struck two, (there was no
doubt an appointment between the pair,) Mr. Frederick Bullock called,
and he and Mr. Borne walked away together,
The Colonel of the -th regiment, in which Messieurs Doing and Of-
borne had companion, was an old general who had made his first campaign
under Wolf at Queen, and was long since quite too old and feeble for
command; but he took some interest in the regiment of which he was the
nominal head, and made certain of his young oflicers welcome at his table,
a kind of hospitality which I believe is not altogether common amongst
his brethren of the present day. Captain Doing was an especial favourite
of this old General. Doing was vereed in the literature of his profession,
and could talk ulout the great Frederic and the Empress Queen and their
words host as well as the General himself, who was indifferent to the
triumphs of the present day, and whose heart was with the tacticians of fifty
years back. This officer sent a summons to Doing to come and breakfast
with him, on the morning when Mr. Borne altered his will and MIr.
Copper put on his best shirt fill, and then informed his young favourite, a
couple of days in advance, of that which they were all expecting-a march-
in order to go to Belgium. The order for the regent to hold itself in
readiness would leave the 1Worse Gurds in a day or two; and as trains-
sorts were in plenty, they would get their route before the week was over.
kecruits had come in during the stay of the regiment at Chatham; and the
old General hoped that the regiment which had helped to beat Montcalm
in Canada, and to rout Mr. WYashington on Long Island, would prove
itself worthy of its historical reputation on the soft-trodden battle-grounds
of the lOw Countries. ``And so my good friend, if you have any afire
I,'' said the old General, taking a pinch of snuff with his trembling white
old hand, and then pointing to the spot of his robe de became under
which his heart was still feebly beating, ``if you have any Phillis to con-
sole, or to bid farewell to papa and mamma, or any will to ne, I recom-
mend you to set about your business without delay.'' With which the
General give his young friend s finger to shake, and a good-natured nod
of his powdered and pig-tailed head; and the door being closed upon Do-

Mademoiselle Menander of His MAjesty's Theatre.
This news made Doing grave, and he thought of our friends at Brighton,
and then he was ashamed of himself that Amelia was always the first thing.
in his thoughts, (always before anybody-before father and mother, sisters
and duty-always at waking nd sleeping indeed, and all day long); and
returning to his hotel, he sent off a brief note to Mr, Borne acquainting
him with the information which he had received, and which might tend
farther, he hoped, to bring about a reconciliation with George.
This note, dispatched by the same messenger who s carried the in-
invitation to Copper on the previous day, alarmed the worthy clerk not a
little. It was enclosed to him, and as he opened the letter he trembled
lest tie dinner should be put off on which he was calculating. llis mind

was inexpressibly relieved when he found that the envelope was only a
reminder for himself. (I shall expect you at half-past five,'' Captain Do-
bin wrote). He was very much interested about his employer's family;
but, he could out ' a grand dinner was of more concern to him than
the affairs of any other mortal.
Doing was quite justified in repeating the General's information to any
officers of the regiment whom he should see in the course of his peregrina-
nations; accordingly he imparted it to Ensign Stuhble, whom he met at
the agent's, and who, such was his military ardour, went off instantly to
purchase a new sword ar the nccoutrement-maker's. Here this young
fellow, who though only seventeen years of age, and about sixty-five inches
high, with n constitution naturally rickety mud much admired by pray-
sure brandy and water, had an undoubtedly courage and a lion's heart, poised,
tried, bent, and balanced a weapon such as he thought would do expect-
lion amongst Frenchmen. Shouting `` II, ha,'' and standing lis little feet
with tremendous energy, he delivered the point time or thrice nt Captain
Sobbing, who carried the thrust laughingly with his bamboo walking-stick.
Mr, Stubble, as may be supposed from his size and slenderness, was of
the Light Bobs. FEnsign poetry, on the contrary, was a tall youth, and
belonged to (Captain Doing's) the Readier Company, and he tried on
a new bear-skin cap, under which he looked savage beyond his years.
Then these two lads went off to the Slaughter's, and having ordered a
furious dinner, sat down and wrote off letters to the kind anxious parents
at home-letters full of love and heartiness, and pluck and bad spelling.
All there were many anxious hearts beating through England at that
time; and mothers' prayers and tears flowing in many homesteads.
Seeing young Stubble engaged in composition at one of the coffee-room

tables at the Slaughter's, and the tears trickling down his nose on to the
paper, (for the youngster was thinking of his mamma, and that he might
never see her again,) Doing, who was going to write off a letter to
George Borne, relented, and locked up his desk.  Why should I?2'
said he. `'Let her have this night, happy. Ill go and see my parents
early in the morning, and go down to Brainton myself to-morrow.''
So he went up and laid his big hand on young Stubble's shoulder, and
backed up that young champion, and told him if he would leave off brandy
nd water he would be a good soldier, as he always as a gentlemanly
good-hearted fellow. Young Stubble's eyes brightened up at this, for
Doing was greatly respected in the regent, as the best officer and the
severest man in it.
 Thank you, Doing,'' he said, rubbing his eyes with his knuckles, I
was just-just telling her I would. And, O Sir, she's so dam kind to
me.'' The water pump were at work again, and I am not sure that the
soft-hearted Curtain's eyes did not also twinkle.
The two ensigns, the captain and Mr. Copper, dined together in the
same box. Copper brought the letter from Mr. Borne in which the
latter briefly presented lis conpliments to Curtain Doing, and requested
him to forward the disclose to Captain George Borne. Copper knew
nothing further ; he described Mr. Borne's appearance, it is true, and his
interview with his lawyer, wondered how the governor and sworn at
nobody, and, especially as the wine cireled round, abounded in speculations
and conjectures. But these grew more vague with every glass, and at length
became perfectly unintelligible. At a late hour Captain Doing put his
guest into a hackney coach, in a hiccupping state, nd swearing that he
would be the knock--the kick-captain's friend for ever and ever.
WHen Captain Doing took leave of Miss Borne we have said tent he
asked leave to come and pay her another visit, and the spinster expected
him for some hours the next day, when, perhaps, had he come, and had he
asked her that question which she was prepared to answer, she would have
declared herself as her brother's friend, and a reconciliation might have
been effeeted between George and his angry father. But though she
waited at home the captain never come. lie had his own affairs to pur-
sue; his own parents to visit and console; and at an early hour of the day
to take his place on the Lightning coach, and go down to his friends at
Brainton. In the course of the day Miss Borne heard her father give
orders that that medlling scoundrel, Captain sObbing, should never be
admitted within his doors again, and any hopes in which she may have
indulged privately, were thus abruptly brought to an end. Mr. Frederic
Bullock come, and was particularly affectionate to MIaria, and attentive to
the broken-spirited old gentleman. For though he said his mind would
be easy, the means which he had taken to secure quiet did not seem to
have succeeded as yet, and the events of the past two days had visibly
shattered him.

cONDUCTED to the ladies, at the
Ship Inn, Doing assumed a jovial
and rattling manner, which proved
that this young officer was be-
coming a more consummate you-
write every day of his life. DIe
was trying to hide his own private
feelings, first upon seeing Mrs.
George Borne in her new con-
dition, and secondly to mask the
apprehension he entertained as to
the effect which the dismal news
brought down by him would her-
vainly have upon her.
 It is my opinion, George,''
he said, that the French Em-
perry will be upon us, horse and foot, before three weeks are over, and
will give the Duke such a dance as shall make the Peninsular paper mere
child's play. But you need not say that to Mrs. Borne, you know.
There mayn't be any fighting on our side after all, and our business in
Belgium may turn out to be a mere military occupation. Many persons
think so; and Brussels is full of fine people and ladies of fashion.'' So
it was agreed to represent the duty of the British army in Belgium in this
harmless light to Amelia.
This plot being arranged, the hypoeriticnl Doing saluted Mrs. George
Borne quite gaily, tried to pay her one or two compliments relative to
her new position as a bride (which compliments, it must be confessed,
were exceedingly clumsy and hung fire wofully), and then fell to talking
about Brighton, and the sea-air, and the gieties of the place, and the
beauties of the road and the merits of the `' Lightning'' coach and horses,
--all in a manner quite incomprehensible to Amelia, and very amusing ta
Rebecca, who was watching the Captain, as indeed she watched every one
near whom she came.
Little Amelia, it must be owned, had rather a men opinion of her
husband's friend, Captain Doing. He lisped-he was very plain and
homely-looking : and exceedingly awkward and ungainly. She liked him
For his attachment to her husband, (to be sure there was very little merit
in that), and she thought George was most generous and kind in extend-
ing his friendship to his brother oficer. George had implied Doing's
is and queer manners many times to her, though to do him justice, he

always spoke most highly of his friend's good qualities. In her little day
of triumph, and not knowing him intimately as yet, she made light of
honest William-and he knew her opinions of him quite well, and
acquiesced in them very humbly. A time came when she knew him
better, and changed her notions regarding him: but that was distant
as yet.
As for Rebecca, Captain Doing had not been two hours in the ladies'
company, before she understood his secret perfectly. She did not like
him, and feared him privately; nor was he very much prcpossessed in her
favour. He was so honest, that her arms and cjolerics id not affect him,
and he shrank from her with instinctive repulsion. And, as she was by no
means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy, she disliked him
the more for his adoration of Amelia. Nevertheless, she was very
respectful and cordial in her manner towards him. A friend to the
Osbornesl a friend to her dearest benelactorsl She vowed she should
always love him sincerely : she remembered him quite well on the Vaux-
hall night, as she told Amelis archly, and she made a little fun of him
when the two ladies went to dress for diner. Rawdon Crawled paid
scarcely any attention to Doing, looking upon him as a good-natured
nincompoop, and under-bred city man. Joy patronised him with much
dignity.
When George and Dobin were alone in the latter's room, to which
George had followed him, Doing took from his desk the letter which
he had been charge by Mr. Borne to deliver to his son.  It 's not in
my father's hand-writing,'' said George, looking rather alarmed; nor
was it: the letter was from Mr. Borne's lawyer, and to the following
elect :-
 BrOwn Row, Ifay 7, 1815.
So,
 I am commissioned by Mr. Borne to inform you, that he ubides by
the determination which e before expressed to you, and that in conse-
quence of the marriage which you have been pleased to contract, he
ceases to consider you henceforth as a member of his family. This deter-
ambition is final and irrevocable.
`though the monies cxpended upon you in your minority, and the
bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparing of late years, far
exceced in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right,
(being the third part of the fortune of your mother, the late Mrs. Borne,
and which reverted to you at her decease, and to Miss Jane Scorned and
Miss Muaria France Borne;) yet I am instructed by Mr. Borne to
say, that he waves all claim upon your estate, and that the sum of 2000,
4 per went. annuities, at the value of the day (being your one-third share
of the sum of I6000,) shall be paid over to yourself or your agents upon
your receipt for the same, y
 Your obedient Serve.,
S. Was.''
P.9S.-Mr. Stone desires me to say, once for all, that he declines to
receive any messages, letters, or communications from you on this or any
other subject.''
A NOVEL WITH0A A HERO.
211
'A pretty as you have managed the affair,'' said George, looking
savagely at William Doing. ``Look there, Doing,'' and he flung over
to the latter lis parent's letter. ``A beggar, y Jove, and all in conse-
quenee of my d-d sentimentality. Why couldn't we have waited? A
ball might have done for me in the course of the war, and may still, and
how will Emmy be bettercd by being left a beggar's widow It was all
your doing. You were never easy until you had got me married and
ruined. What the deuce am I to do with two thousand points Such
a sum won't last two years. I 've lost a hundred nnl forty to Crawled at
cards and billiards since I've been down here. A pretty manager of a
man's matters you are, forsooth.''
There's no denying that the position is a hard one,'' Doing replied,
after reading over the letter with a blank countenance; `` and, as you say,
it is partly of my making. There are some men that wouldn't mind changing
with you,'' he added, with a bitter smile.  How many Captain in the
recgiment have two thousand pounds to the fore, think you? You must
live on your pay till your father relents, and if you die, you leave your
wife a hundred a year.''
Do you suppose a man of my habits can live on his pay and a sun-
drew a year'' George cried out in great anger.  You must be a fool to
talk so, Doing. How the deuce am i to keep up my position in the
world upon such a pitiful pittancef I can't change my habits. I must
lay my comforts. I wasn't brought up on porridge like MacWhirler, or
on potatoes, like old O'Down. Do you expect my wife to take in soldiers'
washing, or ride after the regiment in a baggage waggon''
Well, well,'' said Doing, still good-naturedly, ' we 'll get her a better
conveyance. But try and remember that you are only a dethroncd prince
now, George, my boy; and be quiet whilst the tempest lasts. It won't be
for long. Let your name be mentioned in the Gazette, and I'll engage
the old father relents towards you.''
Mentioned in the Gazatte.'' George answered. ' And in what part
of it Among the killed and wounded returns, and at the top of the list,
very likely.''
Psha It will be time enough to cry out when we are hurt,'' Daring
said. `' And if anything happens, you know, George, I have got a little,
and I am not a marrying man, and I shall not forget my golden in my
ill,'' he added, with a smile. Whereupon the dispute ended,-as many
scores of such conversations between Scorned and his friend had concluded
previously-by the former deelariug there was no possibility of being angry
with Doings long, and forgiving him very generously after absing hi
without cause,
`I say, Beck,'' eriel Rawdon Crawled out of his dressing-room, to
his lady, who was stirring herself for dinner in her own chamber.
WIt '' said Boy's shrill voice. She was looking over her shoulder
in the glass. She had put on the nearest and freshest white frock imagine-
able, and with bare shoulders and a little necklace, and a light blue sash,
she looked the image of youthful innocence and girlish happiness.
I say, what '1a Mrs. O. do, when O. goes out with the regiment2''

lion on his pretty little wife.
`I suppose she 'll try her eyes out,'' Beck answered. ` She has been
whimpering half-a-dozen of times at the very notion of it, already to me.''
 you don't care, I suppose,'' Brandon said, half angry at his wife's
want of feeling.
of wretch don't you know that I intend to go with you,'' Beck
replied. :Besides, you 're different. You go as General Tufts's side-
de-camp. i don't belong to the line,'' Mrs. Crawled said, throw-
ing up her head with an air that so enchanted her husband that he stooped
down and kissed it.
 Rawdon, dear-don't you think-you 'd better get that-money from
Cupil, before he goest'' Beck continued, fixing on a killing bow. She
called George Borne, Cupid. She had flattered him about his good
looks a score of times already. She watched over him kindly ut crte of
 night when he would drop in to BRandon's quarters for a hall-hour
before bed-time.

having practised it in former days upon Rawdon Crawled. He thought
her gay, brisk, arch, distinguee, delightful. In their little drives and
dinners Beck, of course, quite outshone poor Emmy, who remained
very mute and timid while Mrs. Curled and her husband rattled away
together, and Captain Crawled (and Joy after he joined the young married
people) gobbled in silence.
Emmy's mind somehow misgave her about her friend. Rebeecn's wit,
spirits, and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet. They
were only a week married, and here was George already suffering enni
and eager for others' society She trembled for the future. How shall
I be a companion for him, she thought,-so clever and so brilliant, and 1
such a humble foolish creature How noble it was of him to marry me-
to give up everything and stoop down to me. I ought to have refused
him, only I had not the heart. I ought to have stopped at home and
taken care of poor papa. And her neglect of her parents (and indeed
there was some foundation for this charge which the poor child's uneasy
conscience brought against her) was now remembered for the first time,
and caused her to blush with humiliation. Oh thought the, I have been
very wicked and selfish-elfish in forgetting them in their sorrows-
selfish in forcing George to marry me. I know I 'm not worthy of him-
I know he would have been happy without me-and yet-I tried, I tried
to give him up.
It is hard when, before sewvrlays of marriage are her, such thoughts
and confessions as these force tnselves on a little bride's mind. But so
it was, and the night before Dobin come to join these young people-on
a fine brilliant moonlight night of May-so warm and balmy that the
windows wereng open t t valley, from which George arsl Mrs.
Crawled wefgazing upon the calm ocean spread shining before them,
while Iyg.and Joy were eggs at ee get within-Amelio

felt a despairing remorse such as were bitter companion- for that tender
lonely soul. cnrce a week was past, and it was come to this The future,
had she regarded it, offered a dismal prospect; but May was too sly, so
to speak, to look to that, and embark alone on that wide sea, and unfit to

` In 't it clever of riot remember the? Pool we learned it all at Miss
Piukerton's How white sees, and how ever everything. I declare
I can almost see the coast of France'' and her bright green eyes streamed
out, and shot into the night as if they could see through it.

the long wisps of hair-when Brings goes out to bathe, I intend to dive
under her awning, and insist on a reconciliation in the water. Isn't that
n stratagemP''
George burst out laughing at the idea of this aquatic meeting. : What's
the row there, you two'' Rawdon shouted out, rattling the box.
Amelia was making a fool of herself in an absurd hysterical manner, and
retired to her own room to whimper in private.
Our history is destined in this Chapter to go backwards and forwards in
a very irresolute manner seemingly, and having conducted our story to
to-morrow presently, we shall immediately again have occasion to step back
to yesterday, so that the whole of the tale may get a hearing. As you be-
old nt her Majesty's drawing-room, the ambassadors' and high dignitaries'
carriages whisk off from a private door, while Captain Ones's ladies are
waiting for their fly: as you see in the Secretary of the Treasury's ante-
chamber, a half-dozen of petitions waiting patiently for their audience, and
called out one by one, when suddenly an Irish member or some eminent per-
strong enters the apartment, and instantly walks into Mr. Under-Secretary
over the heads of all the people present: so in the conduct of a tale, the
romance is obliged to exercise this most partial sort of justice. Although
all the little incidents must be heard, yet they must be put off when the
great events make their appearance; and surely such a circumstance as
that which brought Doing to Brighten, viz. the orlering out of the
Guards and the line to medium, and the muttering of the allied nrmies in
that country under the command of his Grace the Duke of Wellington-
such a dignified circumstance as that I say-was entitled to the pas over all
minor oeecurrences whereof this history is composed manly, and hence a
little trifling disarrangement and disorder was excusable and becoming.
We have only now advanced in time so far beyond Chapter XXII. as to
have got our various characters up into their dressing-rooms before the
dinner, which took place as usual on the day of Doing's arrival.
George was too humane or too much occupied with the tie of his neck-
loth to coney at once all the news to MAmelia which his comrade had
brought with him from London. He came into her room, however, hold-
ing the attorney's letter in his hand, and with so solemn and important an
air that his wife, always ingeniously on the watch for calamity, thought the
worst was about to befall, und running up to her husband, besought her
dearest George to tell her everything-he was ordered abroad; there
would he a battle next week-she knew there would.
Dearest George carried the question about foreign service, and withal
melancholy shake of the head said, : No, Emmy; it can't that : it's not
myself I care about : it's you. I have had bad news from my father.
He refuses any communication with me; he has flung us off; and leaves
us to poverty. I can rough it well enough; but you, my dear, how will
you bear it rend here. And he handed her over the letter.
melia, with a look of tender alarm in her eyes, listened to her noble
her as he uttered the above generous sentiments, and sitting down on the
bed, read the letter which George gave her with such a pompous martyr-
like air. Her face cleared up as she read the document, however. The idea
of sharing poetry and privation in company with the beloved object, is,
A NOY WITHOUT A HER0.
21
as we have before said, far from being disagreeable to a warm-hearted
woman. The notion was actually pleasant to little Amclia. Then, as usual,
she was ashamed of herself for feeling happy at such an indecorous moment,
and checked her pleasure, saying demurely, ` O, George, how your poor
heart must bleed at the idea of being separated from your papa.''
`'It does,'' said George, with an agonised countenance
`` But he can't be angry with you long,'' she continued.  Nobody
could, I'm sure. le must forgive you, my dearest, kindest husband.
O, I shall never forgive myself if he does not,''
 What vexes me, my poor Lady, is not my misfortune, but yours,''
George said. ``I don't care for a little poverty; and I think, without
vanity, I 've talents enough to make my own way.''
That you have,'' interposed his wife, who thought that war should
cease, and her husband should be made a general instantly.
 Yes, I shall make my way as well as another,'' Borne went on;
`but you, my dear girl, how can I bear your being deprived of the cow
forts and station in society which my wife had a right to expect Me
dearest girl in barracks; the wife of a soldier in a marching regiment;
subject to all sorts of annoyance and privutionl It makes me miserable,''
My, quite at ease, as this was her husband's only cause of disquiet,
took his hand, and with a radiant face and smile began to warble that
stanzas from the favourite song of e Wapping Old Stairs,'' in which the
heroine, after rebuking her Tom for inattention, promises ``his trowsers ta
mend, and his grog too to make,'' if he will be constant and kind, and not
forsake her. `Besides,'' she said, after a pause, during which she
looked as pretty and happy as any young woman need, `` isn't two thou-
sand pounds an immense deal of money, GEorge''
George laughed at her native; and finally they went down to dinner,
Amelia clinging on George's arm, still wurbling the tune of ` Tapping Old
Stairs,'' and more pleased and light of mind than she had been for some
days past.
Thus the repast, which at length came off, instead of being dismal, was
an exceedingly brisk and merry one. The excitement of the eampaign
counteracted in George's mind the depression occasioned by the rising-
hearing letter. Doing still kept up his character of rattle. He amused
the company with accounts of the army in Belgium, where nothing but
fetes and gaiety and fashion were going on. Then, having a particular
end in view, this dexterous captain proceeded to describe Mrs. Moor
O'Down, packing her own and her Major's wardrobe, and how his best
results had been stored into a teas canister, whilst her of famous
yellow turban, with the bird of paradise wrapped in brown paper, was
locked up in the Mayor's tin coeked-hat case, and wondered what effect it
would have at the French king's court at Ghent, or the great military
balls at Brussels.
Ghent 1 Brusselsl'' cried out Amelia with a sudden shock and start.
Is the regiment ordered away, George,-is it ordered away?'' A look of
terror came over the sweet smiling face, and she clung to George as by an
instinct.
 Don't be afraid, dear,'' he said good-naturedly;  '`it is but a twelve
hour's passage. It won't hurt you. You shall go, too, EArly.''
216
YIY FAIR.
I intend to go,'' said Beck, ` 'm on the staff. General Tufts is
great flirt of mine. Is'not he, Rawdon''
Rawdon laughed out with his usual roar. William Doing flushed up
quite red. ` She can't go,'' he said; `` think of the-of the danger,'' he
was going to add; but had not all his conversation during dinner-time
tended to prove there was none He became very confused and silent.
I must and will go,'' Amelia cried with the greatest spirit ; and George,
applauding her resolution, patted her under the chin, and asked all the per-
sous present if they ever saw such a termagant of a wife, and agreed that
the lady should bear him company.  We'll have Mrs. O'Down to chaperon
you,'' he said. What cared she so long as her husband was near her ?
Thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was juggled way. Though
war and danger were in store, war and danger might not befal for months
to come. There was a respite at any rate, which made the timid little
Amelia almost as happy as a full reprieve would have done, and which even
Doing owned in his heart was very welcome. For, to be permitted to see
her was now the greatest privilege and hope of his life, and he thought with
himself secretly how he would watch and protest her. I wouldn't have
let her go if I had been married to her, he thought. But George was the
master, and his friend did not think it to demonstrate.
Putting her arm round her friend's waist, Rebuke at length carried
Amelia off from the dinner-table where so much business of importance
had been discussed, and left the gentleman in a highly exhilarated state,
drinking and talking very gaily.
In the course of the evening Rawdon got a little family-note from his
wife, which although he crumpled it up and burnt it instantly in the candle,
we had the good luck to read over Rcbecca's shoulder. ` Great news,''

company was about adjoining to coffee in the women's apartment, Raw-
don touched Borne on the elbow, and said gracefully, '` I say, Scorned,

was not quite convenient, but nevertheless George gave him a considerable
present instrument in bank notes from his pocket-book, and a bill on his
agents at a week's date, for the remaining sum.
This matter arranged, George, nd Joy, and Doing, held a council of
war over their cigars, and agreed that a general move should be made for
London in Joy's open carriage the next day. Job, I think, would have
preferred staying until Rawdon Crawled quitted right, but Doing
and Courage overruled him, and he agreed to carry the party to tow,
and ordered four horses, as became his dignity. With these they set off
in state, after breakfast, the next day. Amelia had risen very early in the
morning, and packed her little trunks with the greatest alacrity, while
Borne lay in bed exploring that she had not a mind to help her. She
was only too glad, however, to perform this office for herself. A dim
easy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already; and although
they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we know what
jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other virtues of her sex.

remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;
Miss Crawled, namely, und the suite in attendance upon her. Now,
although Leeches and her husband were but at a few stones' throw of the
lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawled occupied, the old lady's door
remained s pitiless closed to them as it had been heretofore in London.
As long as she remained by the side of her sister-in-law, Mrs. But
Crawled took care that her beloved Matilla should not be agitated by a
meeting with her nephew. When the spinster took her drive, the faithful
Mrs. But sat beside her in the carriage. When Miss Crawled took the
air in a chair, Mrs. But marched on one side of the vehicle, whilst honest
Brings occupied the other wing. And if they met Rawdon and his wife
by chance-although the former constantly und obsequiously took off his
hat, the Miss-Crawled party passed him by with such a frigid and killing
indifference, that Rawdon began to despair.
We might as well be in London as here,'' Captain Rawlon often said,
with a downcast air.
` A comfortable inn in Brighton is better than a singing-house in
Chaneery Lane,'' his wife answered, who was of a more cheerful tempera-
ment. " Think of those two aides-de-camp of Mr. Moses, the sheriff'a.

stupid, but Mr. Joy and Captain Cupid are better companions than Mr.
Moses's men, BRandon, my love.''
I wonder the wits haven't followed me down here,'' Rawdon con-
tinued, still desponding.
 When they do, we 'll find means to give them the slip,'' said dauntless
little Been, and further pointed out to her husband the great comfort
and advantage of meeting Joy and Borne, whose acquaintance had
brought to Rawdon Crawled a most timely little supply of ready money.
 1t will hardly be enough to pay the inn bill,'' grumbled the Guardsman.
 Why need we pay it'' said the lady, who had an answer for every-
thing.
Through Rawson's valet, who still kept up a trifling acquaintance with
the male inhabitants of Miss Crawled's servants' hall, and was instructed
to treat the coachman to drink whenever they met, old Miss Crawled's
movements were pretty well known by our young couple; and Rebecca
luckily bethought herself of being unwell, and of calling in the same
upothecary who was in attendance upon the spinster, so that their inform-
notion was on the whole tolerably complete. Nor was Miss Brings,
although forced to adopt a hostile attitude, secretly ironical to Rawdon
and his wife. She was naturally of a kindly and forgiving disposition.
Now that the cause of jealousy was removed, her dislike for Rebecca dis-
appeared also, and she remembered the latter's invariable good words and
good humour. And, indeed, she and Mrs. Firkin, the lady's-maid, and
the whole of Miss Crawled's household, secretly groaned under the tyranny.
of the triumphant Mrs. But.
As often will be the case, that good but imperious woman pushed her
advantages too far, and her successes quite unmereifully. She had in
the course of a few weeks brought the invalid to such a state of helpless
docility,,that the poor soul yielded herself entirely to her sister's orders,
and did not even dare to complain of her slavery to Brings or Firkin,
Mr. But measured out the glasses of wine which Miss Craven was
daily allowed to take with irresistible accuracy, greatly to the annoyance
of Firkin and the butler, who found themselves deprived of control over
even the Sherry-bottle. She apportioned the sweet-bread, jellies,
chickens; their quantity and order. Night and noon and morning she
brought the abominable drinks ordainad by the Doctor, and made her
patient swallow them with so affecting an obedience, that Firkin said my
poor Missus du take her physic like a lamb. She presoribel the drive in
the carriage or the rid in the chair, and, in a word, ground down the old
lady in her convalescenee in such a way as only belongs to your proper-
managing, motherly, moral would. If ever the patient faintly resisted,
and pleaded for a little bit more inner or a little drop less medicine, the
nurse threatened her with instantaneous death, when Miss Crawled in-
scanty gave in,. ` She's no spirit let. in her,'' Firkin remarked to Brings;
``she faint ave called me a fool these three weeks.'' Finally, Mrs. But
had made up her mind to dismiss the aforesaid honest lady's-maid, Mr,
Bowls the large confidential man, and Brings herself, and to send for her
daughters from the Rectory, previous to removing the dear invalid bodily
to queen's Crawled, when an odious accident happened which called her
away from duties so pleasing. The Reverend But Crawled her husband,

riding home one night, fell with his horse and broke his collar-bone. Fever
and inflammntory symptos set in, and Mrs. But was forced to leave
unseen. for ampshire. As soon as ever But was restored she promised
to return to her dearest friend, and departed, leaving the strongest injury-
tions with the household regarding their behaviour to their mistress; and
as soon as she got into the Southampton coach, there was such a jubilec and
sense of relief in all Miss Crawled's house, as the company of persons
nsscmbled there had not experienced for many a week before. That very
day Miss Crawled left off her afternoon dose of melicine: that afternoon
Bowls opened an independent bottle of Sherry for himself and MRs. Firkin :
that night Miss Crawled and Miss Brings indulged in a game of picture
instead of one of Porteus's sermons. It was as in the old nursery-story,
when the stick forgot to bent the dog, and the whole course of events
underwent a peaceful and happy revolution.
At a very early hour in the morning, twice or thrice a week, Miss Brings
used to betake herself to no bathing-machine, and disport in the water in n
flannel gown, and an oilskin cap. Rebeeca, as we have seen, was aware of'
this circumstance, and though she did not attempt to storm rings us she
had threatened, and actually dive into that lady's presence and surprise
her under the sacredness of the awning, Mrs., pardon determined to
attack Brings as she came away from her bath, refreshed and invigoratel
hy her dip, and likely to be in good humour.
So, getting p very early the next morning, Beck brought the
telescope in their sitting-room, which faced the seas, to bear upon the
bathing-machines on the beach; saw Brings arrive, enter her box, and put
out to sea; and was on the shore just as the nymph of whom she came in
quest stepped out of the little carnvan on to the shines. It was a pretty
picture: the beach; the hathing-women's faces ; the long line of rocks and
building were blushing and bright in the sunshine. Rebecca wore a kind,
tender smile on her face, and was holding out her pretty white hand as
Brings emerged from the hour. What could Brings do but accept the
salutation '
MIss S-, Mrs. Crawled,'' she said.
Mrs, Crawled seized her hand, pressed it to her heart, and with a sad-
den impulse, flinging her arms round bRings, kissed her affeetionately.
'Dear, dear friend1'' she said, with a touch of such natural feeling, that
Miss Brings of course at once began to meet, and even the bathing-woman
was mollitied.
Rebecca found no difficulty in engsging Brings in a long, intimate,
and delightful conversation. very thing that had passed since the morn-
ing of CHeek's sudden departure from Miss Crawled's house in Park
Lane up to the present lay, and Mrs. But's happy retreat, was discussed
and described by Brings. All Miss Crawled's symptomns, and the parting-
ears of her illness and medical treatment, were narrated by the confidunte
with that fulness and accuracy which women delight in. About their
eomplaints and their doctors do ladies her tire of talking to each other ?
Brings did not on this occasion; nor did Rebeccn weary of listening. She
was thankful, truly thankful, that the dear kind Brings, that the faithful,
the invaluable Firkin, had been permitted to remain with their benefactres

through her illness. Heaven bless her though she, Rebecca, had seemed
to act undutifully towards Miss Crawled; yet was not her fault a natural
and exscusable one? Could she help giving her hand to the man who had
won her heart Brings, the sentimental, could only turn up her eyes to
heaven at this appeal, and have a sympathetic sigh, and think that she,
too, had given away her affections long years ago, and own that Rebecea
was no very great criminal.
Can I ever forget her who so befriended the friendless orphan No,
though she has cast me off,'' the latter said,  ``I shall never cease to love
her, and I would devote my life to her service. As my own benefuactress,
is my beloved Rawson's adored relative, I love and admire Miss Crawled,
dear Miss Brings, beyond any woman in the world, and next to her I love
all those who are faithful to her. IT would never have treated MIss
Crawled's faithful friends as that odious desiguing Mrs. But had done.
Rawdon, who was all heart,'' Rebecea continued, `` although his outward
manners might seem rough and careless, had said a hundred times, with
tears in his eyes, that he blessed Heaven for sending his dearest Aunt two
such admirable nurses as her attached Firkin and her nadmirable Miss
BRings. Should the machinations of the horrible Mrs. But end, as she
too much feared they would, in banishing everybody that Miss Draw-
let loved from her side, and leaving that poor lady a victim to those
harpics at the Rectory, Rebecca besought her (Miss bRings) to remember,
that her own home, humble as it was, was always open to receive bRings.
Dear fiend,'' she exclaimed, in a transport of enthusiasm, '` some hearts
can uerer forget benefits; all women are not But CrawleysI though why
should I complain of her,'' Rebeeca added; `` though I have been her too
and the victim to her arts, do I not owe my dearest Rawdon to her 2''
And Ilebeccn unfolded to Brings all Mrs. But's conduct at Queen's
Cruelty, which, though unintelligible to her then, was clearly enough
explained by the events now,-now that the attachment had sprung up
which AIrs. But had encouraged by a thousand sacrifice,-now the two
innocent people had fallen into the snares which she had laid for them,
and loved and married and been ruined through her schemes.
It was all very true. Driggs saw the stratagems as clearly as possible.
Mrs. But had made the match between Rawdon and ebeccu. et,
though the latter was a perfectly innocent victim, Miss Brings could not
disguise from her friend her fear that Miss Crawled's attections were
hopelessly estranged from became, and that the old lady would never
1forgive her nephew for making so imprudent a marriage.
On this point Rebeccn had her own opinion, and still kept up a good
heart. If Miss Crawled did not forgive them at present, height ant least
relent on a future day. Even now, there was only that puling, sickly Pitt
Crawled between woman and a baronet; and should anything happen
to the former, all would be well. At all events, to have Mrs. HBute's
designs exposed, and herself well abused, was a satisfaction, and might be
advantageous to woman's interest; and Rebecca, after an hour's chat
with her recovered friend, left her with the most tender demonstrations of
regard, and quite assured that the conversation they had had together
would be reported to Miss Crawled before many hours were over.

This interview ended, it became full time for Rebecea to return to her
inn, where all the party of the previous day were assembled at a farewell
breakfast. Rebeeca took such a tender leave of Amelia as became two
women who loved each other as sisters; and having used her handkerchief
plentiful, and hung on her friend's neck as if they were parting for ever, and
waved the handkerchief (which was quite dry, by the way) out of window,
as the carriage drove off; she came back to the breakfast-table, and
ate some phrase with a good deal of appetite, considering her emotion;
and while she was munching these delicacies, explained to London what
had occurred in her morning walk between herself and Brings. Her hopes
were very high: she made her husband share them. She generally such-
ended in making her husband share all her opinions, whether melancholy
or cheerful.
 You will now, if you please, my dear, sit down at the writing-table
and pen me a pretty little letter to Miss Crawled, in which you'll say that
you are a good boy, and that sort of thing.'' 8So Newson sure down, and
wrote off, ``Brighton, Thursday,'' and  My dear Aunt,'' with great
rapidity : but there the gallant officer's imagination failed him. DIe
mumbled the end of his pen, and looked up in his wife's face. She could
not help laughing at his rueful countenance, and, marching up and down
the room with her hands behind her, the little woman began to distance a
letter, which he took down.
` Before quitting the country and commencing a cumpaign, which very
possibly may be fatal,''
e What?'' said Pardon, rather surprised, but took the humour of the
phrase, and presently wrote it down with a grin.

see that he made no mistakes in spelling-`` bescech is not spclt with na,

ledge of his little Missis.
I thought that you were aware of the progress of my attncliment,''
Rebecca continued:I knew that Mrs. But Crawled confirmed and
encouraged it. But i1 make no reproaches. I married a poor woman, and
am content to abide by what I have done. Leave your property, dear
Aunt, as you will. I shall never complain of the way in which you dis-

for money's sake. I want to be reconciled to you ere I leave England.
Let me, let me see you before I go. A few weeks or months hence it may
be too late, and I cannot bear the notion of quitting the country without a
kind word of farewell from you.''
She won't reeognize my style in that,'' said Beck. `I made the sun-
trees short and brisk on purpose.'' And this pathetic missive was dis-
patched under cover to Miss bRings.
Old Miss Crawled laughed when bRings with great mystery handed her
over this candid and simple statement.  We may read it now Mrs. But
is away,'' she said. `' Head it to me, Brings.''
When Brings had read the epistle out, her patroness laughed more.
Don't you see, you goose,'' she said to Brings, who professed to be much
touched by the honest affection which pervaded the composition, ``Don't
you see that Pardon never wrote a word of it. I never wrote to me
without asking for money in his life, and all his letters are full of bad
spelling, and dnshes, and bad grammar. It is that little serpent of a
governess who rules him.'' They are all alike, Miss Crawled thought in
her heart. They all want me dead, and are lankering for my money.
I don't mind seeing Rawdon,'' she added, after a pause, and in a tone
of perfect indifference.  I had just as soon shake hands with him as
not. Provided there is no scene, why shouldn't we meet I don't
mind. But human patience has its limits; and mind, my dear, I respect-
fully decline to receive Mrs. Rawlon-I can't support tat quite''-and Miss
griggs was fain to be content with this half-message of reconciliation; and
thought that the best method of bringing tha old lady and her nephew
together, was to warn Rawdon to be in waiting on the Cliff, when Miss
Crawled went out for her air in her chair.
There they met. I don't know whether Miss Crawled had any private
feeling of regan:l, or emotion upon seeing her old favourite; but she held out
a couple of fingers to him with as smiling and good-humoured an air, as if
they had met only the day before. And as for woman, he turned as red
as scarlet, and wrung off Brings's hand, so great was his rapture and his
confusion at the meeting. Perhaps it was interest that moved him: or
perhaps affection: perhaps he was touched by the change which the illness
of the last weeks had wrought in his aunt.
THe old girl has always acted like n trump to me,'' he said to his
wife, as he narrated the interview, `` and I felt, you know, rather queer,
and that sort of thing. I walked by the side of the what-do'e-all-'em,
to know, and to her own door, where Bowls came to help her in.
And I wanted to go in very much, only-''

 No, my dear, I 'm hanged if I wasn't afraid when it came to tlc

 You fool you ought to have gone in, and never come out again,''
Ilebeccn said.
Don't call me names,'' sin the big guardsman, sulkily.  Perhaps I
was a fool, Beck, but you should't say so;'' and he gave his wife
look, such as his countenance could wear when angered, and such as
was not pleasant to face.
A NOVEL WITH A HE0.
 Well, dearest, to-morrow you must be on the look-out, and go and
see her, mind, whether she asks you or no,'' Rebecca said, trying to
soothe her angry yoke-mate. On which he replied, that he would do
exactly as he liked, and would just think her to keep a civil tongue in
her head-and the wounded husband went away, and passed the forenoon
at the billiard-room, sulky, silent, and suspicious.
But before the night was over he was compelled to gie in, and now,
as usual, to his wife's superior prudence and foresight, by the most meal-
holy confirmation of the presentimeuts which she had regarding the
consequences of the mistake which he had made. Miss Crawled west
have had some emotion upon seeing him and shaking hands with him after
so long a rupture: She mused upon the meeting a considerable time.
`'Brandon is getting very fat and old, rings,'' she said to her empty-
noon. `` His nose has become red, and he is exceedingly course in appear-
ance. His marriage to that woman has hopelessly vulgarised him. Mrs.
But always said they drank together; and I have no doubt they do.
Yes: he smelt of gin abominably. I remarked it. Din't you''
In vain Brings interposed, that Mrs. But spoke ill of everybody : and,
as far as a person in er humble position could judge, ss an-
`An artful designing woman Yes, so she is, and she does speak ill
of every one,-but I am certain that woman has made Rawdon drink. All
those low people do--''
`He was very much affected at seeing you, Ma'am,'' the companion
said ; `` and I am sure, when you remember that he is going to the field ol
anger--''
How much money has he promised you, Brings '' the old spinstei
cried out, working herself into n nervous rage-''there now, of course you
begin to cry. I hate scenes. Why am I always to be worried Go and
cry up in your own room, and send Firkin to me,--no, stop, sit down and
blow your nose, and leave off crying, and write a letter to Captain Crawled.''
Poor Brings went and placed herself obediently at the writing-book. Its
leaves were blotted all her with relics of the firm, strong, rapid hand-
writing of the spinster's late amanuensis, Mrs. But Crawled.
``Begin `My dear sir,' or `' Dear sir,' that will be better, and say you are
desired by Mrs. Crawled-no, by Miss Crawled's medical an, by Mr.
Creamer, to state, that my health is such that all strong emotions would

and that if he will take the trouble to call upon my lawyer's in Grass Inn
Square, he will find there a communication for him. Yes, that will do;
and that will make him leaf Brighton.'' The enevolent lriggs penned
this sentence with the utmost satisfaction.
tO seize upon me the very day after Mrs. But was gone,'' the old
lady prattled on; ``it was too indecent. Brings, my dear, write to Mrs.
Crawled, and say ale needn't come back. No-she needn't-and she

and choked with poison. They all want to kill me-all-all''-and with
this the lonely old woman burst into a stream of hysterical tears.
The last scene of her dismal Vanity Fair comedy was fast approaching;
the tawdry lamps were going out one by one; and the dark curtain was
almost ready to descend,
That final paragraph, which referred Rawdon to Miss Crawled's solicitor
in London, and which Brings had written so good-naturedly, consoled the
dragoon and his wife somewhat, after their first blank disappointment, on
reading the spinster's refusal of a reconciliation. And it fetched the pur-
pose for which the old lady has caused it to be written, by making
selldon very eager to get to London.
Out of Joy's losing and George Borne's bank-notes, he paid his
bill at the inn, the landlord whereof does not probably know to this day
how doubtfully his account once stood. For, as s general sends his bag-
age to the rear before an action, Rebecca and wisely packed up all their
chief valuable and sent them off under care of George's servant, who
went in charge of the trunks on the coach back to London. Rawdon and
his wife returned by the same conveyance next day.
I should have liked to see the old girl before we went,'' Rawdon said.
She looks so cut up and altered that I 'm sure she can't last long. I
wonder what sort of a cheque I shall have at Way's. Two hundred-it
can't be less than two hundred,-hey Beck P''
In consequence of the repeated visits of the gentlemen whose portraits
ve been taken in a preceding page, Rawdon and his wife did not go
Make to their lodgings at hBrompton, but put up at an inn. Early the next
morning, Rebecca had an opportunity of seeing them as she skirted that
suburb on her round to old Mrs. Sedley's house at Fulham, whither she
went to look for her lent Amelia and her Brighton friends. They were all
off to Chatham, thence to larwich, to take shipping for Belgium with the
regiment-kind old Mrs. Sedley very much depressed and tearful, solitary.
Returning from this visit, Rebecca found her husband, who had been off ta
Gray's In, and learnt his fate. He came back furious.
`By Jove, Beck,'' says he, ``she's only given me twenty pounds''
Though it told against themselves, the joke was too good, and Beck
burst out laughing at Rawson's discomfiture.

N quitting Briglton, our friend George
as became a person of rank and fashion
travelling in a barouche with four horses,
drove in state to a fine hotel in Craven-
wish square, where a suite of splendid
rooms, and a table magnificently fur-
wished with plate and surrounded by a
half-dozen of black and silent waiters,
was ready to receive the young gentle-
nan and his bride. George did the
honours of the place with a princely air
to Joy and Sobbing; and Amelia, for the
first time, and with exceeding shyness
and timidity, presided at what George
George pooh-poohed the wine and bullied the waiters royally, and
Joy gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction. Doing helped him to
it; for the lady of the house, before whom the street was placed, was so
ignorant of the contents, that she was going to help Mr. Sedley without
bestowing upon him either calipash or charlie.
The splendour of the entertainment, and the apartments in which it
was given, alarmed Mr. Doing, who remonstrated after dinner, when
Joy was asleep in the great chair. But, in vain he cried out against the
enormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an archbishop. I'e

pleased with himself for his magnificence of spirit. Nor did Sobbing
try and convince him, that Amelia's happiness was not centred in
turtle-soup.
A while after dinner, Amclia timidly expressed a wish to go and see
her mamma, at Fulham: which permission George granted her with some
grumbling. And she tripped away to her enormous bed-room, in the
centre of which stool the enormous unereal bed, `that the Emperor
Alexander's sister sleep in when the allied sufferings was ere,' and put
on her little bonnet and shawl with the utmost eagerness and pleasure.

looking vainly into his face once or twice, and went sadly down the great
staircase, Captain Doing after, who handed her into the vehicle, and
saw it drive away to its destination. The very valet was ashamed of
mentioning the address to the agency-coachman before the hotel-waiters,
and promised to instruct him when they got further on.
Doing walked home to his old quarters at the Slaughters', thinking
very likely that it would be delightful to be in that hackney-coach, long
with Mrs. Borne. George was evidently of quite a different taste; for
when he had taken wine enough, he went off to half-price at the play, to
see Mr. Keen perform in Shylock. Captain Borne was a great love of
the drama, and had himself performed high-comedy characters with great
distinction in several garrison theatrical entertainment. Joy slept on
until long after dark, when he woke up with a start at the motions of
his servant, who was removing and emptying the enchanter on the table;
and the shame-coach stand was again put into requisition for a carriage
to convey this stout her to his lodgings and bed.
Mrs. Sedley, you may be sure, clasped her daughter to her heart with
all maternal eagerness and affection, ring out of the door as the carriage
grew up before the little garden-gate, to welcome the weeping, trembling,
young bride. Old Mr. Clasp, who was in his shirt-sleeves, trimming the
garden-plot, shrank back alarmed. The Irish servant-lass rushed up from
the kitchen and smiled a God bless you.' Amelia could hardly walk
along the flags and up the steps into the parlour.

each other kiss and cry together quite loudly. How much more do they
feel when they love. Good mothers are married over again at their
daughters' wedding: and as for subsequent events, who does not know
how ultra-maternal grandmothers are?-in fact a woman, until she is a
grandmother, does not often really know what to be a mother is. Let us

contempt. e To the health of your master and mistress, Trotter,'' Mr,
Sedley said, '`and here's something to drink your health when you get
home, Trotter,''
There were but nine days past since Smell lad left that little cottage
and home-and yet how far off the time seemed since she had bidden it
farewell. What a gulf lay between her and that past life. She could
look back to it from her present standing-place,. and contemplate, almost
as another being, the young unmarried girl absorbed in her love, having
no eyes but for one special object, receiving parantal affection if not in-
gratefully, at least indifferently, and as if it were her due-her whole
heart and thoughts but on the accomplishment of one desire. The review
of those days, so lately one yet so far away, told her with shame; and
the aspect of the kind parents filled her with tender remorse. Was the
prize gained-the heaven of life-and the winter still doubtful and un-
satisfied As lis ra and heroine pass the mntrimonial barrier, the
novelist generally dsps te curtain, as if the drama were over then : the
doubts and struggles of one ended: as if, once landcd in the marriage
country, all were green and pleasant there: and wife and husband had
nothing but to link each other's arms together, and wander gently down-
wards towards old age in happy and perfect fruition. But our little Amclia
was just on the bank of her new country, and was already looking
anxiously back towards the sad friendly figures waving farewell to her across
the stream, from the other distant shore.

In honour of the young bride's arrival, her mother thought it necessary
to prepare i don't know what festie entertainment, and after the first
ebullition of talk, took leave of Mrs. George Borne for a while, and dived
down to the lower regions of the house to a sort of kitchen-parlour
(occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Clasp, and in the evening, when her dishes
were wasted and her curl-papers removed, by Miss Flanuigan the Irish
servant), there to take measures for the preparing of a magnificent for-
melted tea. All people have their ways of expressing kindness, and it
seemed to Mrs. Sedley that n musing and a quantity of orange marmalade
spread out in a little cut-glass summer would be peculiarly agreeable fresh-
ment to Amelia in her most interesting situation.
While these delicacics were being transacted below, Amelia, leaving the
drawing-room, walked up stairs and found herself, she scarce knew how,
in the little room which she had occupied before her marriage, and in that
very chair in which she had passed so many bitter hours. She sank back
in its arms as if it were an old friend ; and fell to thinking over the past
week, and the life beyond it. Already to be looking sadly and vaguely
back : always to be pining for something which, when obtained, brought
doubt and sadness rather than pleasure : here was the lot of our poor
little creature, and harmless lost wanderer in the great struggling crowds
of Vanity Fair.
Here she sat, and recalled to herself fondly that image of George to

which she had knelt before marriage. Did she own to herself how different
the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?
It requires many many years-and a man must be very bad indeed-
before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession.
Then Rebecea's twinkling green eyes and baleful smile lighted upon her,
and filled her with dismay. And so she sat for awhile indulging in her
usual mood of selfish brooding, in that very listless melancholy attitude in
which the honest maid-servant had found her, on the day when she brought
up the letter in which George renewed his offer of marriage.
She looked at the little white bed, which had been hers a few days
before, and thought she would like to sleep in it that night, and wake, as
formerly, with her mother smiling over her in the morning. Then she
thought with terror of the great funeral miss pavilion in the vast and
dingy state bed-room, which was awaiting her at the grand hotel in Craven-
wish Square. Dear little white bed! how many a long night had she
wept on its pillow How she had despaired and hoped to die there; and
now were not all her wishes accomplished, and the lover of whom she had
despaired her own for her? Kind mother how patiently all tenderly
she had watched round that bed1 She went nnl knelt down by the bed-
side; and there this wounded and timorous, but gentle and loving soul,
sought for consolation, where as yet, it must be owned, our little girl hal
but seldom looked for it. Love had been her faith hitherto; and the sad,
bleeding, disappointed heart, began to feel the want of another consoler.
Have we a right to repeat or to overhear her prayers These, brother,
are secrets, and out of the domain of Vanity Fair, in which our story lies.
But this may be said, that when the ten was finally announced, our
young lady came down stairs a great deal more cheerful ; that she did not
respond, or deplore her fate, or think about George's coldness, or Rehecca's
eyes, as she had been wont to do of late. She went down stairs, and
kissed her father and mother, and talked to the old gentleman, and made
him more merry than he had been for many a day. She sat down at
the piano which Doing had bought for her, and sung over all her father's
favourite old songs. She pronounced the tea to be excellent, and praised
the exquisite taste in which the marmalade was arranged in the spaces.
And in determining to make everybody else happy, she fond herself so;
and was sound asleep in the great funeral pavilion, and only woke up with
a smile when George arrived from the theatre.
For the next day, George had more important `business' to transact
than that which took him to see Mr. Mean in Shylock. Immediately on
his arrival in London he had written off to his father's solicitors, signilying
his royal pleasure that an interview should take place between them on
the morrow. His hotel loss at billiards and cards to Captain Crawled had
almost drained the young man's purse, which wanted replenishing before
he set out on his travels, and he had no resource but to infringe upon the
two thousand pounds which the attorneys were commissioned to pay over
to him. He had a perfect holief in his own mind that his father would
relent before very long. HOw could any parent he moderate for a length of
time against such a paragon as he was If his mere past and personal

merits did not succeed in mollifying the father, George determined that he
would distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that
the old gentleman must give in to him. And if not: Ball the world
was before him. His luck might change at curls, and there was a lend of
spending in two thousand pounds.
So he sent off Amelin once more in a carriage to her mamma, with strict
orders and carte blanche to the two ladies to purchase everything quite-
site for a lady of Mrs. George Borne's fashion, who was going on a
foreign tour. They had but one day to complete the onutfit, and it may be
imagined that their business therefore occupied them pretty fully. In a
carriage one more, bustling about from nilliner to linendraer, escorted
back to the carriage by obsequious shopmen or polite ones, MRs. Sedley
was herself again almost, and sincerely happy for the first time since their
uisfortunes. Nor was MRs. Amelia at all above the pleasure of shopping,
and beginning, and seeing and buying pretty things. (Would any man,
the most philosophic, give twopence for a woman who was) She gay
herself a little treat, obedient to her husband's orders, and purchased a
quantity of lady's gear, showing a great deal of taste and elegant discern-
ment, is all the shopfolks said.
And about other that was ensuing, MRs. Borne was not much alarmed;
Bonaparty was to be crushed almost without a struggle. Margate packets
were sailing every day, filled with men of fashion and ladies of note, on their
way to Brussels and Ghent. PEople were going not so much to a far as
to a fashionable tour. The newspapers laughed the wretched upstart and
swindler to scorn. Such a Corsican wretch as that withstand the armies
of Europe and the genius of the mortal Wellingtonl Amelia held it
in utter contempt; for it needs not to be said that this soft and gentle
creature took her opinions from those people who surrounded her, such
fidelity being much too humble-minded to think for itself. Well, in a word,
she and her mother performed a great day's stopping, and she quitted
herself with considerable liveliness and credit on this her first appearance
in the genteel world of London.
George meanwhile, with his hat on one side, his elbows squnred, and
is swaggering martial nor, made for Before Now, and stalked into the
attorney's offices as if he was lord of every pale-faced clerk who was scrib-
being there. DIe ordered somebody to inform Mr. This that Captain
Colonel was waiting, in a fierce and patronizing way, as if the plains of an
nttorney, who hal thrice his brains, fifty times his money, and a thousand
times his experience, was a wretched underling who should instantly leave
all his business in life to attend on the Captain's pleasure. He did not
see the sneer of contempt which passed all round the room, from the first
clerk to the articles gets, from the articles gets to the ragged writers
and white-faced corners, in clothes too tight for them, as he sat there
tapping his boot with his cane, and thinking what a parcel of miserable
poor devils these were. The miserable poor devils knew all about his affairs.
1hey talked about them over their points of beer at their public-house clubs
to other clerks of night. e Gods, what do not attorueys and attorneys'
clerks know in London Nothing is hidden from their inquisition, and

Perhaps George expected, when he entered Mr. Girls's apartment, to
find that gcutlean commissioned to give him some message ol common-
nine or couciliation fro his father; perhaps his haughty and cold
demeanour was adopted as a sign of his spirit and resolution: but if so,
his fierceness was met by a chilling coldness and indifference on the
attorney's part, that rendered swaggering absurd. he pretended to be
writing at a paper, when the Captain entered. `` Pry, sit down, Sir,''
said he, ``and I will attend to your little affair in moment. Mr. love,
get the release papers, if you please;'' and then he fell to writing again.
Poet having produced those papers, his chief calculated the count of
two thousand pounds stock at the rate of the day; and asked Curtain
Osborue whether he would take the sum in a cheque upon the bakers,
or whether he should direct the latter to purchase stock to that out.
 One of the lute MRs. Borne's trusted is out of town,'' he said indif-
fervently, ``but my elient wishes to meet your wishes, and have done
with the business as quick as possible.''
Give me a cheque, Sir,'' said the Captain very surlily. `Damn the
shillings and valence, Sir,'' he added, as the lawyer was making out the
amount of the draft; and, clattering himself that by this stroke of g-
naniuity he had put the old quit to the blush, he stalked out ol lis office
with the paper in his pocket.

and Mr. George Borne tleucelorth dismissed from these worthy gentle-

The draft was upon our friends llulker and Bullock of Lombard Street,
to whose house, still thinking he was doing business, George bent his
way, and from whom he received his one. Frederick ullock, lls.,
whose yellow face was over a lcdger, at which sat a demure clerk, had-
opened to be in the making-room when George entered. His yellow face
turned to a more deadly colour when he saw tlc Captain, and he slunk
back guiltily into the inmost parlour. George was too busy glouting over

his own baggage and outfit was put into a state of speedy preparation,

HEN Joy's fine carriage drove up to
the inn door at Chatham, the first face
which Amelia recognized was the
friendly countenance of Captain Do-
bin, who had been pacing the street
for an hour past in expectation of
his friends' arrival. The Captain, with
shells on his frock-coat, and a crimson
sash and sabre, presented a military
appearance, which made Joy quite
proud to be able to claim such an
acquaintance, and the stout civility
hailed him with a cordiality very
different from the reception which
Joy vouchsafed to his friend in.
Brighton and Bond Street.
Along with the Captain was Ensign
Stubble; who, is the barouche neared
the inn, burst out with an exclamation
of ' By Jove what a pretty girl'' highly appealing Colonel's choice.
Indeed, MAmclia dressed in her wedding-pelisse and pink ribbons, with a
flush in her face, occasional by rapid travel through the open air, looked
so fresh and pretty, as full to justify the Ensign's compliment. Doing
liked him for making it. As he stepped forward to help the lady out of
the carriage, Stubble saw what a pretty little hand she gave him, and
what a sweet pretty little foot came tripping down the sep. He blushed
profusely, and made the very best bow of which he was capable; to which
hmelia, seeing the number of the -th regiment embroidered on the
Ensign's cap, replied with a blushing smile, and na curse on her part;
which finished the young Ensign on the spot. Doing took most kindly
to Mr. Stubble from that day, and encouraged him to talk about Amelin
in their private walks, and at each other's quarters. It became the fashion
indeed among all the honest young fellows of the -th to adore and
admire Mrs, Borne. PIer simple artless behaviour, and modest kindness
of demeanour, won all their unsophisticated hearts; all which simplicity
and sweetness are quite impossible to describe in print. But who has
not beheld these among women, and recognized the presence of all sorts
of qualities in them, even though they say no more to you than that
they are engaged to dance the next quadrille, or that it is very lot
weather? George, always the champion of his regimcnt, rose immensely

in the opinion of the youth of the course, by his gallantry in marrying this
motionless young creature, and by his choice of such a pretty kind
partner.
In the sitting-room which was awaiting the travellers, Amelia, to her
surprise, found a letter addressed to Mrs. Captain Osbomne. It was a
triangular billet, on pink paper, and sealed with a dove and an olive
branch, and a profusion of light-blue sealing wax, and it was written in a
very large, though undecided female hand.
I's Prey GOod's st,'' said Gorge, laughing. `'Know it by the
kisses on the seal.'' And in fact, it was a note from Mrs. Major O'Down,
requesting the pleasure of Mrs. Borne's company that very evening to
a small friendly party. eTou must go,'' George said. e You will make
acquaintance with the regiment there. O'Down goes in command of the
regiment, and eggs goes in command of O'How.''
But they had not been for many minutes in the enjoyment of Mrs.
O'Down's letter, when the door was flung open, and a stout jolly lady, in
a riding-habit, followed by a couple of officers of Ours, entered the room.

Sure, I couldn't stop till may-time. Present me, Large, my dear fellow,
to your lay. Madam, I 'm delighted to see ye; and to present to you
me husband, Memory O'Down;'' and with this, the jolly lay in the riding-
habit grasped Amelia's hand very warmly, and the latter knew at once
that the lady was before her whom her husband had so often laughed at.
You 've often heard of me from that husband of yours,'' said the lady
with great vivacity.
 you 've often heard of her,'' echoed her husband, the Mlajor.
Amelia answered, smiling, ``that she had.''
:And small good he 's told you of me,'' Mrs. O'Down replied; adding
that ``George was a wicked drive,''
tHat I 'll go sail for,'' said the Major, trying to look knowing, at which
George laughed; and Mrs. O'Down, with a top of her whip, told the
Mnjor to be quite; and then requested to be presented it for to MRs.
Captain Borne.
 This, my dear,'' said George with great resist, ``is my very good,
kind, and excellent friend, Natural Mlargaretta, otherwise called Perry.''
 1Faith, you 're right,'' interposed the Moor.
. Otherwise called eggs, lady of Msjor Michael O'Down of our regi-
ment, and daughter of Fitzjurld Her'sword de Burgo Malony of Glan-
alone, County Mildred.''
`And Bunyan Queer, Doblin,'' said the lady with calm superiority.
`And Bunyan square, sure enough,'' the Moor whispered.
'was there ye courted me, Memory, dear,'' the lady said; and the
MInor assented to this as to every other proposition which was made
generally in company.
Major O' Down, who had served his sovereign in every quarter of theworld,
and had paid for every step in his profession by me more than equal-
lent act of daring and gullantry, was the most molest, silent, sheen-laced
and meek of little men, and as obedient to his wife as if he had been her
way-boy. At the mess-table he mute silently, and rank a great deal. When
full of liquor, he reeled silently home. When he spoke, it was to agree
with everybody on every conceivable point; and he passed through life in
perfect sense and good humour. The hottest suns of India never heated
is temper; and the Leathern ague never shook it. He walked up to a
matter with just as much indifference as to a dinner-table; had dine on
horse-flesh and turtle with equal relish and appetite; and had an old
mother, Ms. O'Down of ODowstown indeed, whom he had never dis-
obeyed but when he ran away and enlisted, and when he persisted in
marrying that odious Perry Malony.
Perry was one of five sisters, and eleven children of the noble house
of Glenmalony; but her husband, though her own cousin, was of the
mother's side, and so had not the insatiable advantage of being allied to
the Ladies, whom she believed to be the most famous fly in the
world. Having tried nine seasons at Blind and two st Bath and Chel-
stream, and not finding a partner for life, Miss Malony ordered her
cousin Dick to marry her when she was about thirty-three years of age;
and the honest fellow obeying, carried her off to the West Lives to preside
over the ladies of the -th regiment, into which he had just exchanged.

Before Mrs. O'Down was half an hour in Armelia's (or indeed in anybody
else's) company, this amiable lady told all her birth ad pedigree to her
new friend. `` MY dear,'' said she, good-naturedly, ``it was my intention
that Large should be a brother of my own, and my sister Glorvina would
have suited hi entirely. But as bygones are bygones, and he was
engaged to yourself, why, I'm determined to take you as a sister instead,
and to look upon you as such, and to love you as one of the family.
Faith, you've got such a nice good-natured face and way wide you, that
I 'm sure we 'll agree; and that you 'll be an addition to our family any-
way,''
i'Feel and she will,'' said O'Down with an approving air, und Amelia
felt herself not a little amused and grateful to be thus suddenly introduced
to so large a party of relations,
eWe 're all good fellows here,'' the Moor's lady continued. There's
not a regiment in the service where you 'll find a more united society nor
n more agreeable mess-room. There 's no quarrelling, flickering, stand-
thing, nor small talk amongst as. We all love each other.''
 Especially Mrs. Genius,'' said George, laughing.
` Mrs. Captain Genius and he has made up, though her treatment of
me would bring me gray hairs with sorrow to the true.''
`And you with such a beautiful front of black, Perry my dear,'' the
Mnjor cried.
 Hould your tongue, Nick, you booby. Them husband are always in
the way, Mrs. Scorned, my dear; and as for my Mid, I often tell him he
should never open his mouth but to give the word of command, or to put
meat and drink into it. I 'I tell you about the regiment, and warn you
when we 'are alone. Introduce me to your brother now; sure he's a mighty
fine man, and reminds me of me cousin Dan Malony (Melody of Ballads-
long, my dear, you know, who mr'ice Ophalia Scully, of Oystherstown,
own cousin to Lord Poldoody). Mr. Sedley, Sir, I 'm delighted to be
made known te ye. I suppose you'll dine at the mess to-day. (Mind
that driver of a mother, sick, and whatever ye du, keep yourself sober for
me party this evening.)
It's the 150th gives us a farewell dinner, my love,'' interposed the
Major, `` but we'll easy get a cry for Mr. Sedley.''
`But sImple (sign Simple, of Ours, my dear Amelia. I forgot to
introjuiee him to ye.) Run in a hurry, with Mr. Major O'Down's
complimcnts to Colonel This, and Captain Shone has brought his
brothernlaw down, and will bring him to the 150th mess at five o'clock
sharp-when you and i, my tear, will take a stack here, if you like.''
Before Mrs. O'Down's speech was concluded, the young sign was
trotting down stairs on his commission.
 Obedience is the soul of tlc army. We will go to our duty while
Mrs. O'Down will stay and enlighten you, my,'' Captain Borne said;
and the two Captain, taking each a wing of the Major, walked out with
that oflicer, grinning at each other over his head.
Ad, now having her new friend to herself, the impetuous Mrs, O'Down
proceeded to pour out such a quantity of information as no poor little
von's memory could ever tax itself to bear. She told Amelia a thousand

particulars relative to the very numerous family of which the amazed
young lady found herself a member. :Mrs. Hecavytop, the Colonel's
wife, died in Jamaiea of the yellow fever and a broken heart combined,
for the horrid old Colonel, with a head as bald as a cannon-ball, was
making sheep's eyes at a half-caste girl there. Mrs. Genius, though
without education, was a good woman, but she had the divine's tongue,
and would cheat her own mother at whist. Mrs. Captain Kick must
turn up her lobster eyes forsooth at the idea of an honest round game,
(wherein me father, as pious a man s her went to church, me uncle
Done Malony, and our cousin the Bishop, took a hand at low, or whist,
every night of their lives). Neither of 'em's goin with the regiment this
time,'' Mrs. O'Down added. Fancy Genius stops with her mother, wha
sells small coal and potatoes, most likely, in Islington-town, hard by
London, though she's always dragging of her father's ships, and pointing
them out to us as they go up the river: and Mrs Kick and her children
will stop here in Bethesda Place, to be nigh to her favourite preacher,
Dr. Ramshorn. MRs. Sunny 's in an interesting situation-faith, and she
always is, then-and has given the Lieutenant seven already. And
Ensign Posky's wife, who joined two months before you, my dear, has
usual'd with Tom Posky a score of times, till you can hear 'em all over

During, did a Marchioness to teach us the true Parisian pronunciation,
and a retired Mejor-General of the French service to put us through the
exercise.''
Of this incongruous family our astonished Amelia found herself all of
a sudden n member: with Mr, O'Down as an elder sister. She was pre-
seated to her other female relations at tea-time, on whom, as she was
quiet, good-natured, and not too handsome, she made rather an agreeable
impression until the arrival of the gentlemen from the mess of the l50th,
who all admired her so, that her sisters began, of course, to find fault
with her.
e I hope Borne has sown his wild ones,'' said Mrs. MIagenis to Mrs.
Sunny.  If a reformed rake makes a good husband, sure it's she will
have the fine chance with Large,'' Mrs. O'Down, remarked to Posky, who
had lost her position as bride in the regiment, and was quite angry with
the usurper. And, as for Mrs. Kick; the disciple of Dr. Ramshorn put
one or two leading professional questions to MAmelia, to see whether she was
awakened, whether she was a protfessing Christian and so forth, and finding
from the simplicity of MRs. Borne's replies that she was yet in utter
darkness, put into her hands three little penny books with pictures, viz. the
Howling Wilderness,'' the  WAsherwoman of Wanlsworth Common,''
and the `` British Soldier's best Bayonet,'' which, bent upon awakening
her before she slept, Mrs. Kick begged Amelia to read that night ere she
went to bed.

comrade's pretty will, and paid her their court with soldierly gallantry.
She had a little triumph, which flushed her spirits un made her eyes
sparkle. George was proud of her popularity, and pleased with the
manner (which was very by and graceful though naive and a little timid)
with which she received the gentlemen's attentions, and answered their
compliments. And he in his uniform-how much handsomer he was than
any man in the room She felt that he was affectionately watching her,
and glowed with pleasure at his kindness. ` I will make all his friends
welcome,'' she resolved in her heart. I will love all who love him. I
will always try and be gay and good-humoured and make his home
happy.''
The regiment indeed adopted her with exclamation. The Curtains
approvel, the Lieutenants applauded, the knsigns admired. Old Butler
the Doctor made one or two jokes, which, being professional, need not be
repeated; and Cackle, the Assistant M.bE. of Edinburgh, condescenled to
examine her upon literature, and tried her with his tree best French
quotations. young Stubble went about from man to man whispering,
Jove, isn't she a pretty salt'' and never took his eyes off her except
when the news came in.
As for Captain DOing, he never so much as spoke to her during the
whole evening. bUt he and Captain Porter of the 150th took home Joy
to the hotel, who was in a very muslin state, and had told his tiger-hunt
story with great effect, both at the mess-table ; and at the street, to Mrs.
O'Down in her turban and bird of paradise. LIving put the Collect
into the lands of his servant, Doing loitered about, smoking his cigar
before the inn door. George had meanwhile very carefully shawled his
wife, and brought her away from MIss, O'Down's after a general hand-
shaking from the young officers, who accompanied her to the by, and
clearer that vehicle as it lroe off. So Amelia gave Doing her little
hand as she got out of the carriage, and rebuked im smilingly for not
having taken any notice of her all night.
The Captain continued that deleterious amusement of smoking, long
after the inn and the street were gone to bed. II watched the lights
vanish from George's sitting-room windows, and shine out in the bed-
room close at hand. It was almost morning when he returned to his
own quarters. DIe could hear the cheering from the slips in the river,
where the transports were already taking in their barges preparatory to
dropping down the Thames.

pretty much unencumberedl to Ramsgate, where there were plenty of
paekets lying, in one of which they had a speedy passage to Ostend.
That period of Joy's life which now ensued was so full of incident, that
it served him for conversation for many years after, and even the tiger-
hunt story was put aside for more stirring narrative which he had to tell
about the great campaign of Waterloo. As soon as he had agreed to
escort his sister abroad, it was remarked that he ceased shaving his upper
lip. At Chatham he followed the parades and frills with great assiduity.
ll listened with the utmost attention to the conversation of his brother
officers, (as he called them in after days sometimes,) and learned as many
ilitary names as he could. In these studies the excellent Mrs. O'Down
was of great assistance to him; and on the day finally when they embarked
on board the Lovely Rose which was to carry them to their destination, he
made his appearance in a bred frock-coat and duck trousers, with a
foraging cap ornamented with a smart gold and. HAving his carriage

He suffered gently on the voyage, during which the ladies were likewise
prostrate; but Amelia was brought to life again as the packet made
Tend, by the sight of the transports conveying her regient, which
entered the harbour almost at the same time with the Lovely Rose.
Is went in a collapsed state to an inn, while Curtain Doing escorted the
ladies, and then busied himself in frecing Joy's carriage and luggage from
the ship and the customhouse, for Mr, Joy was at present without a sea-
want, Borne's man and his own pampered menial having considered
together at Chatham, and refused point-blank to cross the water. This
revolt, which came very suddenly, and on the last day, so alarmed Mr,
Sedley, junior, that he was on the point of going up the expedition, but
Captain Doing (who made himself immensely officious in the business,
Is said), rated him and laughed at him soundly: thle mustnchios were
grown in advance, and Joy finally was persuaded to embark. In place
of the well-bred and well-fed London domestic, who could only speak
English, Doing procured for Joy's party a swartly little Belgian servant
who could speak no language at all; but who by his bustling behaviour,
and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley is ` My lord,'' special acquired
that gentleman's favour. times are altered at Ostend now; of the Britons
who go thither, very few look like lords, or act like those members of our
hereditary aristocracy. They seem for the most part shabby in attire,
dingy of linen, lovers of billiards and brandy, nd cigars and greasy
ordinaries.
But it may be said as a rule, that every ELnglishman in the Duke of
Wellington's army paid his way. The remembrance of such a fact
surely becomes a nation of shopkeepers. It was a blessing for a come-
mere-loving country to be overrun by such an army of customers: and
to have such creditable wnrriors to feel. And the country which they
came to protect is not military. For a long period of history they have
let other people fight there. When the present writer went to survey
with eagle glance the field of Waterloo, we asked the conduetor of the
diligence, a portly walked-looking veteran, whether he had been at the
battle.  Pas si it''-such an answer and sentiment as no Frenchman
would own to-was his reply. But on the other hand, the postilion who
drove us was n iscout, a son of some bankrupt Imperinl General, who
accepted a pennyworth of her on the read. The moral is surely a
good one.
This flat, flourishing, easy country never could she looked more rich
and prosperous, than in that opening summer of 1815, when its green
fields and quiet cities were enlivened by multipkid red-coats: when its
wide classes swnrmed with brilliant eNglish equipages: when its
great canal-boats, gliding by rich pastures and pleasant quaint old viol-
ages, by old chateaux lying amongst old trees, were all crowded with
well-to-do English travellers: when the soldier who drank at the village
inn, not only drank, but paid his score; and Donald the Hlighlander,

and Jeannette were out getting in the hay. As our painters are bent on
military subjects just now, I throw out this as a good subject for the
pencil, to illustrate the principle of an honest English war. All looked as
brilliant and harmless as a Hyde Park review. Meanwhile, Napoleon
screened behind his curtain of frontier-fortress, was preparing for the
outbreak which was to drive all these orderly people into fury and blood;
always so many of them low.
Everybody had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader (for the
resolute faith which the Duke of Wellington had inspired in the whole
English nation was as intense, as that more frantic enthusiasm with which
at one time the French regarded Napoleon), the country seemed in so per-
felt a state of orderly defence, and the help at hand in case of need so near
and overwhelming, that alarm was unknown, and that our travellers, among
whom two were naturally of a very timid sort, were, like all the other must-
plied English tourists, entirely alt case. he famous regiment, with so
many of whose officers we have made acquaintance, was drafted in cnnal-

must remember for the luxury and accommodation they afforded. So
psrodigiously good was the eating and drinking on board these sluggish
but most comfortable vessels, that there are legends extant of an English
traveller who coming to Belgium for a week, and travelling in one of these
boats, was so delighted with the fire there that he went backwards and
forwards from Ghent to Bruges perpetually until the railroads were
invented, when he drowned himself on the last trip of the passage-boat.

lantly to the ladies.
His courage was prodigious. ` Money attack us/'' he cried.  My
dear creature, my poor Emmy, don't be frightened. There's no longer.
The allies will be in Paris in two months, I tell you: when I'll take you
to dine in the Palace Royal, by Jove. There are three hundred thousand
Rooshians, I tell you, now entering France by Valence and the Rhine-
three hundred thousand under Wittgenstein and hBarclay de Folly, my poor
love. You don't know military affairs, my dear. I do, and I tell you
there's no infantry in France can stand against looshian infantry, and no
general of Money's that 's fit to hold a candle to Wittgenstein. Then
there are the Austrians, they are five hundred thousand if a man, and
they are within ten marches of the frontier by this time under Schwartzen-
berg and Prince Candles. Then there are the Prooshians under the
gallant Prince Marshal., Show me a century chief like him now that
Murat is gone. Hay, Mrs. O'Doubt Do you think our little girl here
need be afraid. Is there any cause for fear, Isidor? LIke, Sir? Get
some more beer.''
Mrs. O'Down sail that her Glorvina was not afraid of any man alive
let alone a Frenchman,'' and tossed off a glass of beer with a wink which
expressed her liking for the beverage.
HAving frequently been in presence of the enemy, or, in other words,
faced the Ladies nt Cheltenham and Bath, our friend, the Collect, had
lost a great deal of his pristine timidity, and was now, especially when
fortified with liquor, as talktive as might be. He was rather a favourite
with the regiment, treating the young officers with impetuosity, and
amusing them by his military airs. And as there is one well-known
regiment of the army which travels with a gout hcading the column,
whilst another is led by a deer, George said with respect to his brother-
in-law, that his regiment marched with an elephant.
Since Amelia's introduction to the regiment, George began to be rather
ashamed of some of the company to which he had been forced to present
her; and determined, as he told Sobbing (with what satisfaction to the
latter it need not be said), to exchange into some better regiment soon,
and to get his wife away from these damned vulgar would. But this
vulgarity of being ashamed of one's society is much more common among
men than women; (except very great ladies of fashion, who, to be sure,
indulge in it;) and Mrs. Amelia, a natural and unaffected person, had
none of that artificial shamefaeedness which her husband mistook for deli-
cacy on his own part. Thus Mrs. O'Down and a cock's plump in her hat,
and a very large ``repayther'' on her stomach, which she used to ring on
all occasions, narrative how it had been presented to her by her father, as
she stipt into the car'ge after her mr'ge; and these ornaments, with
other outward peculiarities of the Mayor's wife, give excruciating agonies
to Captain Borne, when his wife and the Mayor's come in contact;
whereas Amelia was only amused by the honest lady's eccentricities, and
not in the least ashamed of her company.
As they made that well-known journey, which almost every Englislan
of middle rank has travelled since, there might have been more instructive,

with fat and can, there was no country like England.''

MInor's lady; proceeding, s is not unusual with patriots of her nation,
to make companions greatly in favour of her own country. The idea of
comparing the market nt bruges with those of bLind, although she had
suggested it herself, caused immense scorn and derision on her part.

and no enemy in front. WHen our travellers arrived at Brussels, in which
their regiment was quartered, n great piece of good fortune, as all said,
they found themselves in one of the guests nd most brilliant little capitals
in eUrope, and were all the Vanity Fair boots were laid out with the
most tempting liveliness and splendour. ambling was here in profusion,
and dancing in plenty : feasting was there to fill with delight that great
gourmand of a Joy: there was a theatre where a miraculous Catalani was
delighting all heurers; beautiful rides, all enlivened with martial splendour;
a rare old city, with strange costumes and wonderful architecture, to
delight the eyes of little Amelia, who had never before sccn a foreign
country, and fill her with charming surprises: so that now and for a few
weeks' space, in a fine handsome lodging, whereof the expenses were borne
by Joy and Osborue, who was flush of money and full of kind attentions to
his wife-for about a fortnight I say, during which her loneymoon ended,
MRs. Amelia was as pleased an happy as any little bride out of England.
Eery day during this happy time there was novelty and amusement
for all parties. There was a church to see, or a picture gallery-there
was a ride, or an opera. The bands of the regimeunts were taking music
at all hours. THe greatest folks of England walked in the lark-there
as a perpetual military festial. George taking out his wife to a new
jaunt or junket every night, was quite pleased with himself us usual, and
swore he was becoming quite a domestic character. And ajaunt or ajuuket
with him/ Was it not enough to see this little heart beating without Iler
letters home to her mother were filled with delight and gratitude at this
season. Her husband bade her buy laces, millinery, jewels, and gimcracks
of all sorts. Oh, he was the kindest, best, and most generous of end
The sight of the very great company of lords and ladies and fashionable
persons who thronged the town and appeared in every public place, filled
George's truly British soul with intense delight. `They flung off that
happy frigidity and inseolence of demeanour which occasionally characterises
the great at home, and appearing in numberless public places, condescenlel
to mingle with the rest of the company whom they met there. One night
at a party given by the general of the division to which George's regient
belonged, he and the honour of dancing with Lady Blanche Thistlewood,
Lord Bareacres' daughter; he bustled for iccs and refrcshments for the
two noble lies; he bushel and squeezed for Lady reaches' carriage;
he bragged about the Countess when he got home, in a way which his
own father could not have surpassed. DIe called upon the ladies the next
day; he rode by their side in the Park; he asked their early to a great
dinner at a restaurateur's, and was quite wild with cxultution when they
agreed to come. Old Bareacres, who hal not much pride and a large
appetite, would go for a dinner anywhere.
I hope there will be no women besides our own party,'' Lay Bare-
acres said, after reflecting upon the invitation which lad been made, and
accepted with too much precipitancy.
``Gracious Heaven, Mamma-you don't suppose the man would bring
his wife,'' shrieked Lady Blancho, who had been languishing in George's
arms in the newly-imported waltz for hours the night before. Tha
`' men are bearable, but their women-''

VANITY FAIR.
 Wife, just married, des'wish pretty woman, I hear,'' the old Earl
said.
 Well, my dear Blanche,'' said the mother, ``I suppose as Papa wants
to go, we must go: but we needn't know them in england, you know.''
And so, determined to cut their new acquaintance in Bond Street, these
great folks went to eat his dinner at Brussels, and condesrending to
make him pay for their pleasure, showed their dignity by making his
wife uncomfortable, and carefully exeluding her from the conversation.
This is a species of dignity in which the high-bred british female
reigns supreme. To watch the behaviour of a fine lady to other and
humbler women is a very good sport for a philosophical frequenters of
Vanity Fir.
This festival, on which honest George spent a great deal of money, was
the very smallest of all the entertainment which Amelia had in her
honey-moon. He wrote the most piteous accounts of the fens home to
her mamma: how the Countess of Bareacres would not answer when
spoken to; how Lady Blanche stared at her with her eye-glass; and
what a rage Captain Doing was in at their behaviour; and how my
lord as they came away from the feast, asked to see the bill, and pro-
nounced it a d- bad dinner, and d- dear. But though Amelia told all
these stories, and wrote home regarding her guests' rudeness, and her own
discomfiture; old Mrs. Sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless, and
talked about Emmy's friend, the Countess of Bareacres, with such assi-
luity that the news how his son was entertaiuing Peers and Peeresses
actually came to Borne's ears in the City.
Those who know the present Lieutennt-General Sir George Tufts,
K.C.B., and have seen him, as they may on most days in the season,
added and in stays, strutting down Pall-Mall with a ricketty swagger on
his high-heeled lacquered boots, leering under the bonnets of passers by,
pr riding n showy chestnut, and going Brougham in the Parks-those
who know the present Sir George Tufts would hardly recognise the
ring Peninsula and Waterloo officer. He has think curling brown hair
and black eyebrows now, and his whiskers are of the deepest purple. He
was light-haired and bald in 18l5, and stouter in the person and in the
limbs, which especially have shrunk very much of late. When he was
about seventy years of age (he is now nearly eighty), his hair, which was
very scarce and quite white, suddenly grew thick, and brown, and curly,
and his whiskers and eyebrows took their present colour. Ill-natured
people say that his chest is all wool, and that his hair, because it never grow,
is wig. Tom Tufts, with whose father he quarrelled ever so many years
ago, declares that Mademoiselle de Misery, of the French theatre, pulled his
grandpaspa's hair off in the green-room; but Tom is notoriously spiteful
and jealous; and the General's wig has nothing to do with our story.
One day, as some of our friends of the -th were sauntering in the
flower-market of Brussels, having been to see the Hotel de Vile, which
Mrs. Major O'Down declared was not near so large or handsome as her
father's mansion of Glenmalony, an officer of rank with an orderly behind
him, rode up to the market, and descending from his horse, came amongst
the flowers, and selected the very finest bouquet which money could by.

The beautiful bundle being tied up in a paper, the officer mounted, giving
the nosegay into the charge of his military groom, who carried it with
grin, following his chief who rode away in great state and self-satin-
action.
 You should see the flowers at Glenmalony,'' Mrs. O'Down was remark-
ing. ' Me father has three Scotch answers with nice helpers. We love
in acre of lot-houses, and pines as common as pays in the sayson. Our
creeps weigls six pounds every bunch of 'em, and upon me honour and
conscience I think our magnolias is as big as taykettles,''
Doing, who never used to `draw out' Mrs. O'Down as that wicked
Borne delighted in doing, (much to Amelia's terror, who implored him
to spare her,) fell back in the crowd, crowing and sputtering until he
reached a safe distance, when he exploded amongst the astonished market-
people with shrieks of yclling laughter.

Died then they are, and bigger, Perry,'' the Moor said. When the
conversation was interrupted in the manner stated by the arrival of the
officer who purchased the bouquet.
`Devlish fine horse,-who is it2'' George asked.
You should see me brother Molloy Money's horse, Masses, that
won the top at the Courage,'' the Mujor's wife was exclaiming, and was
continuing the family history, when her husband interrupted her by
saying-

quietly, ' he and I were both shot in the same leg at Tulsvern.''
Where you got your step,'' said George with a laugh. '" General Tutor
Then my dear the Trawlers are come.''
Amelia's heart fell,-she knew not why. The sun did not seem to
shine so bright. The tall all roofs and gables looked less picturesque all
of a sudden, though it was a brilliant sunset, and one of the brightest and
most beautiful days at the end of May.

his open carriage, with which cattle,
and the smart London vehicle, he
made a very tolerable figure in the
dries about Brussels. George
purchased a horse for his private
riding, and he and Captain Doing
would often accompany the carriage
in which Joy and his sister took
daily excursions of pleasure. They
went out that day in the park for
their accustomed diversion, and
there, sure enough, George's re-
mark with regard to the arrival of
London Crawled and his wife
proved to be correct. In the midst
of a little troop of horsemen, con-
sitting of some of the very greatest persons in Brussels, Rebececea was seen
in the prettiest and lightest of riding-habits, mounted on a beautiful little
Arab, which she rose to perfection (having required the art at queen's
Crawled, where the Baronet, Mr. Pitt, and Rawson himself had given her
many lessons), and by the side of the gallant General Tufts.
Sure, it's the Duke himself,'' cried MRs. Major O'Down to Joy, who
began to blush violently; ``and that 's Lord Oxbridge on the bay. How
clegant he looks Me brother, Molloy Money, is as like him as two peas.''
llebecca did not make for the carriage; but as soon as she perceived
her old acquaintance Amclia seated in it, acknowlcdged her presence by a
gracious word and smile, and by kissing and shaking her fingers playfully
in the direction of the vehicle. Then she resumed her conversation with
General Tufts, who asked ``who the fat officer was in the gold-laced cap?''
on high Beck replicl, `'that he was an officer in the East Indian her-
vice.'' But Rawdon Crawled rode out of the ranks of his company, and
came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said to Joy,  WEll,
old boy, how are you?'' and stared in Mrs. O'Down's face and black cook's
feathers until she began to think she had made a conquest of him.
George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately
with Dozing, and they touched their caps to the august pcersonages, among
whom Borne at once perceived Mrs. Crawled. He was delighted to see
Rawdon leaning over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and
met the side-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding

of
warmth. The nods between Rawdon and Doing were of the very faintest
specimens of politeness.
Crawled told George where they were stopping with General Tufts at
the HOtel du Part, and George made his friend promise to come speedily
to Oslorue's own residence. ``Sorry I hadn't seen you three days ago,''
George said. ` WHIle a dinner at the Restauruteur's-rather a nice thing.
Lord Bareacres, and the Countess, and Lady Blanche, were good chough
to dine with us-wish we'd had you.'' Having thus let his friend know
his claims to be a man of fashion, Borne parted from selldon, who
followed the august squadron down an alley into which they cantered,
while George and Doing resumed their places, one on each side of
Anelia's carriage.
How well the Duke looked,'' Ms. O'Down remarked.  TIe WWel-
valleys and Maloneys are related; but, of course, poor I would never
dream of iutrojuicing mysl unless his Grave thought proper to remember

The apparition of the great personagss held them all in talk during the
drive; and at dinner; and until the hour came when they were all to go
to the Opera.
It was almost like Old England. The house was filled with familiar
BRitish faces, and those toilettes for which the British female has long
been celebrated. Mrs. O'bRown's was not the least splendid amongst
these, and she had a curl on her forehead, and a set of Irish diamonds and
Cairngorms, which oulshone all the decorations in the house, in cr
notion. PIer presence used to excruciate Scorned; but go she would

he could leave alone with less scruple when she had this society. :But
what a comfort it is that Recbecca's come: you will hue her for a friend,
and we may get rid now of this don'd Irishwoman.'' To this Amelia

Near the pretty little woman in white?'' asked a middle-aged men-
tleman seated by the quakers'as side, with orders in his button, and several
under-waistcoats, and a great, choky, white stock.
 That pretty woman in white is Amelia, General: you are remarking
all the pretty women, you naughty man.''
 Only one, begad, in the world'' said the General, delighted, and the
lady gave him a top with a large bouquet which she had.
Beside it's him,'' said Mrs. O'Down; `` and that's the very broad he
bought in the Marshy aux FailurE'' and when Rebecea, having caught
her friend's eye, performed the little hand-kissing operation once more,
Mrs. Minor O'D., taking the compliment to herself, returned the slate
with a gracious smile, which sent that unfortunate Doing shrieking out
of the box again.
At the end of the act, George was out of the box in a moment, and he
was even going to pay his respects to lebecca in her love. He met
Crawled in the lobby, however, where they exchanged a few sentences
upon the oceurrences of the last fortnight.

 You found my cheque all right at the agent'a'' George sail, with a
knowing air.

revenge. Governor come round''

and come on Tuesday;'' and Ilawdon was going off with two brilliant
young gentlemen of fashion, who were, like himself, on the staff of a
general officer.
George was only half pleased to be asked to dinner on that particular
lay when the General was not to dine. 'I will go in and pay my respects
to your wife,'' said he; at which Rawlon said, ` He, as you please,''
looking very glum, and at which the to young officers exchanged know-
ing glances. George parted from them, and strutted down the lobby to
the General's box, the number of which he had carefully counted.
Gentle,'' said a clear little voice, and our friend found himself in
Rebecca's presence; who jumped up, clapped her hands together, and held
out both of them to George, so charmed as she to see him. The
General, with the orders in his button, stared at the new comer with n
sulky scowl, as much as to say, who the devil are you'

``Indeed,'' said the general, with a very small bow, '`of what regiment

George mentioned the -th: how he wished he could have said it was

said. The General all the while was looking savagely from one to the
other.
``Captain Borne, indeed Any relation to the L- Osbornes''
We bear the same arms,'' George said, as indeed was the fact; Mr.
Stone having consulted with a herald in Long Acre, and picked the L-
arms out of the peerage, when he set up his carriage fifteen years before.
The General made no reply to this announcement; but took up his opera-
glass-the double-barrelled london was not invented in those days-and
pretended to examine the house; but Rebecca saw that his disengaged
eye was working round in her direction, and shooting out blood-shot
glances at her and George.

why have we not and any ices ''
` Shall i go and fetch you some '' said the General, bursting with
wrath.
`` Let me go, I entreat you,'' George said.
 No, I will go to Amelin's box. Dear, sweet girl Give me your arm,
Captain George;'' and so saying, and with a not to the General, she
tripped into the lobby. She gave George the queerest, knowingest look,
when they were together, a look which might have been interpreted,
Don't you see the state of affairs, and what a fool I 'm making of him?''
But he did not perceive it. lIp was thinking of his own plans, and lost
in pompous admiration of his own irresistible powers of pleasing.
The curses to which the General gave a low utterance, as soon as
Rebecca and her conqueror hal quitted him, were so deep, that I am sure
no compositor in Lessons. I3ralbury and Evans's establishment would
venture to print them were they written down. They came from the
General's heart ; and a wonderful thing it is to think that the human heart
is capable of generations such produce, and can throw out, as occasion
demands, such a supply of lust and fury, rage and hatred.
Amelia's gentle eyes, too, had been fixed anxiously on the pair, whose
conduct hal so chalet the jealous General ; but when lebecca entered her
box, she flew to her friend with an affectionate rapture which showed itself,
in spite of the publicity of the place; for she embraced her denrest friend
in the presence of the whole house, at least i full view of the General's
glass, now brought to bear upon the Borne party. Mrs. Rawdon
salutel Joy, too, with the kiuliest greeting: she admired Mrs. O'Down's
large Cairugorm brooch and superb Irish diamonds, and wouldn't believe
that they were not from Golcondu direct. She bustled, she chttered, she
turned and twisted, and smiled upon one, and smirked on another, all in
full view of the jealous opera-glass opposite. And when the time for the
ballet come (in which there was no danger that went through her grimace
or performed her comedy of action better), she skipped back to her own
box, leaning on Curtain being's arm this time. No, she would not have

the O'Down was silent and subdued after Beck's brilliant apparition,
and scarcely said a word more about Glenmalony all the evening.

the night at the Opera. `When you intend to give up promising ''

With fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing at the year's end.''
`but I don't think he could pay if he lost,'' Doing said; and his
advice met with the success which advice usually commands. Borne
and Called were repeatedly together now. General Tufts dined abroad
almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very
close indeed to those of the General), which the Side-de-camp and his
wife occupied in the hotel.
Amelia's manners were such when she and George visited Crawled and
his wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first
quarrel ; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident until-
kindness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she comportcdl
herself towards Mrs. Crawled, her old friend; and Amelia did not say one
single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon her, and llcbeccn
scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashul and awkward on
the second visit which she said to Mrs. Rawdon, than on her first call.
Rebeecca was doubly affectionate, of course, and would not take notice,
in the least, of her friend's coolness.  I think Emmy has become prudent
since her father's name was in the -, since Mr. Reilly's is/fortune,''
became said, softening the phrase charitably for George's end.
`Upon my word, I thought when we were not Brighton she was doing
me the honour to be jealous of me; and now I suppose she is seandnlisetl
because woman, and I, and the General live together. Why, my dear
creature, how could we, with our means, live at all, but for a friend to
share expenses And do you suppose that london is not big enough to
take care of my honour i But I 'm very much obliged to Any, very,''
MRs. Rawdon, said.
 Pooh, jealousy!'' answered George, ``all women are jealous.''
`'And all men too. Weren't you jealous of General Tufts, and the
General of you, on the night of the Opera Why, he was ready to eat
me for going with you to visit that foolish little wife of your's; as if I
care a pin for either of you,'' Crawled's wife said, with a part toss of her
heel.  Will you die here he dragon dines with the Commander-
in-Chief. Great news is stirring. They say the French have crossed the
firontier. We shall have a quiet dinner.''
George accepted the invitation, although his wife was a little ailing.
They were now not quite six weeks married. Other woman s laugh-
ing or sneering at her expense, and he not angry. DIe was not even
angry with himself, this good-natured fellow. It is a shame, he owned to

he had often said, smiling and holding knowingly to Stubble and Sooner,
and other comrades of the mess-table; and they rather respected him the
otherwise for this prowess. Next to conquering in war, conquering in
love has been a source of pride, time out of mind, amongst men in Vanity
Fair, or how should school-boys brag of their amours, or Don Juan be
popular?
So Mr. Borne, having a firm conviction in his own mind that he
was a woman-killed and destined to conquer, did not run counter to his
fate, but yielded himself up to it quite complacently. And as Emmy did
not say much or plague him with her jealousy, but merely became un-
happy and pined over it miserably in secret, he chose to fancy that she
was not suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly aware-
namely, that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with Mrs. Crawled.
DIe rode with her whenever she was free. He pretended regimental busy-
ness to Mmelia, (y which falsehood she was not in the least deceived)
and continuing his wife to solitude or her brother's society, passed his
evenings in the Crawled's company; losing money to the husband and
flattering himself that the wife was dying in love for him. It is very
likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspiret, and agreed
together in so many words: the one to cujole the young gentleman,
whilst the other won his money at cards: but they understood each other
perfectly well, and Shadow let Osborue come and go with entire good
humour.
George was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and
Willing sObbing were by no means so much together as formerly. George
avoided him in public and in the regiment, and, as we see, did not like
those sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him. If
some parts of his conduct made Captain Doing exceedingly grave and
cool; of what use was it to tell george that though his whiskers were
large, and his own opinion of lis knowingness great, he was as green as
a schoolboy? that Rawdon was making a victim of him as he had done
of many before, and as soon as he had used him would fling him off with
scorn He would not listen: and so, as Doing upon those days when
he visited the Borne house, seldom had the advantage of meeting his
old friend, much painful and unavailing talk between them was spared.
Our friend George was in the full career of the pleasures of Vanity Fair.
There never was, since the days of Artist, such a brilliant train of camp-
followers s hung round the train of the Duke of Wellington's army in
the Low Countries, in 1815; and led it dancing and feasting, as it were,
up to the very brink of battle. A certain ball which a noble Duchess gave
nt Brusscls on the 15th of June in the above-named year is historical. All
Brussels had been in a state of excitement about it, and I have heard
from ladies who were in that town at the period, that the talk und interest
of persons of their own sex regarding the bell was much greater even
than in respect of the enemy in their front. The struggles, intrigues, and
prayers to get tickets were such as only English ladies will employ, in
order to gain admission to the society of the great of their own notion.
A NOVEL. WITHOUT A HEART0.
263
Joy all Mrs. O'Don, who were panting to be asked, stroke in vain to
procure tickets; but others of our friends were more lucky. For instance,
through the interest of my Lord Bareacres, and as a set-off for the dinner
at the restaurateur's, George got a card for Captain and Mrs. Borne;
which circumstance greatly elated him. Doing, who was a friend of the
General commanding the division in which their regimcnt was, me
laughing one day to Mrs. Osborue, and displayed a similar invitation,
which made Joy envious, and George wonder how the deuce le should be
getting into society. Mr. and Mrs. Rawdon, finally, were of course
invited; as became the friends of a General commanding a canary
bridge.
On the appointed night, George, having commanded new dresses and
ornaments of all sorts for Amelia, drove to the famous ball, where his
wife did not know a single soul. After looking about for Lady Bareacres,
who cut him, thinking the card was quite enough-and after placing
Amelia on a being, he left her to her own cogitations there, thinking, on
his own part, that he had behaved very handsomely in getting her new
clothes, and bringing her to the bull, where she was free to amuse herself
as she liked. Her thoughts were not of the pleasantest, and nobody
except honest Doing came to disturb them.
Whilst her appearance was an utter failure (as her husband felt with a sort
of rage), Mrs. Rawdon Crawled's duet was, on the contrary, very brilliant.
She arrived very late. Her face was radiant ; her dress perfection, in the
midst of the great persons assembled, and the eye-glasses directed to her,
Rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected as when she used to marshal
Mias Pinkerton's little girls to church. Numbers of the men she knew
already, and the studies thronged round her. As for the ladies, it was
whispered among them that Newson had run away with her from out of
a convent, and that she was a relation of the Montmorency family. She
spoke French so perfectly that there might be some truth in this report,
and it was agreed that her manners were fine, and her air distingue. Fifty
would-be partners thronged round her at once, and pressed to have the
honour to dance with her. But she said she was engaged, and only going
to dance very little; and made her way at once to the place where Emmy
same quite unnoticed, and dismnlly unhappy. And so, to finish the poor
child at once, Mrs. Rawdon ran and greeted affiectionately her dearest
hmelia, and been forthwith to patronisc her. She found fault with her
friend's dress, and her hair-dresser, and wondered how she could be so
chaussee, and vowed that she must send her forestiere the next morning.
She vowed that it was a delightful ball; that there was everybody that
every one knew, and only a very few bodies in the whole room. It is a
fact, that in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this
young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could
not speak it better; and it was only from her French being so good, that
you could know she was not a born woman of fashion.
George, who had left Emmy on her bench on entering the ball-room,
very soon found his way back when Rebecca was by her dear friend's side.
Beck was just returning Mrs,. Borne upon the follies which her husband
was committing.  For God's sake, stop him from gabling, my dear,''

se said, ``or he will ruin himself. He and selldon are playing at yards
very night, and you know he is very poor, and Rawson will win every
shilling from him if he does not the care. Why don't you prevent him,
you little careless creature WHy don't you seem to us of an evening,
instead of moping at home with that Captain Doing? I dare say he is
to-amiable; but how could one love a man with feet of such size our
husband's feet are durlings- Here he comes. Where have you been,
wretcheD Here is Emmy crying her eyes out for you. Are you coming to
fetch me for the quadrille%'' And she left her bouquet and shawl by
Amelia's side, and tripped off with George to dance. Women only know
how to wound so. There is a poison on the tips of their little shafts, which
stings a thousand times more than a man's blunter weapon. Our poor
Em, who had never hated, never sneered all her life, was powerless in
the hands of her remorseless little enemy.
George danced with Rebeecca twice or thrice-low many times Amelig
scarcely knew. She sat quite unnoticed in her corner, except when
Rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversation: and later in
the evening, when Captain Doing made so bold as to bring her fresh-
months and sit beside her. He did not like to ask her why she was so sad;
but as a pretext for the tears which were filling in her eyes, she told him
that Mrs. Cruelty had alarmed her by telling her that George would go on
playing.
It is curious, when a man is bent upon play, by what clumsy rogues
he will allow himself to be cheasted,'' Doing said; and Emmy said,
`Indeed.'' She was thinking of something else. It was to the loss of
the money that grieved her.
At last George came back for Rebccea's shall and flowers. She was
going away. She did not even condescend to come c and say good
bye to Amelia. The poor girl let her husband come and go without saying
a word, and her head fell on her breast. Doing and been called away,
and was whispering deep in conversation with the general of the division,
his friend, and had not seen this last parting. George went away then
with the bouquet; but when he gave it to the owner, there lay a note, coiled
like  snake among the flowers. Rebeeca's eye caught it at once. She
had been used to deal with notes in early life. She put out her hand and
took the nosegay. He saw by her eyes as they at, that she was aware
what she should find there. Her husband hurried her away, still too
intent upon his own thoughts, seemingly, to take note of any marks of
recognition which might pass between his friend and his wife. These
were, however, but trifling. became gave George her hand with one of
her usual quick knowing glances, and made a curse and walked away.
George bowed over the hand, said nothing in reply to a remark of Crawled's,
did not hear it even, his brain was so throbbing with triumph and excite-
ment, and allowed them to go away without a word.
His wife saw the one part at least of the bouquet-scene. It was quite
natural that George should come at Rebecca's request to get her her searf
and flowers: it was no more than he had done twenty times before in the
course of the last few days; but now it was too much for her,  W1.

deserted that generous father, and of the thousand kiudnesses which the
stern old man had done him.
He had looked into Amelia's bed-room when he entered ; she lay quiet,
and her eyes seemed closed, and he was glad that she was asleep. On
arriving at his quarters from the ball, he had found his regimental servant
already making preparations for his departure: the man had understood
lis signal to be still, and these arrangements were very quickly and
silently made. Should he go in and wake Amelia, he thought, or leave a
note for her brother to break the news of departure to her He went in
to look at her once again.
She had been awake when he first entered her room, but had kept her
eyes closed, so that even her wakefulness should not seem to reproach
him. But when he had returned, so soon after herself, too, this timid little
heart had felt more at ease, and turning towards him as he slept softly
out of the room, she had fallen into a light sleep. George came in and
looked at her again, entering still more softly. By the pale night-lamp he
could see her sweet, pale face-the purple eyelids were fringed and closed,

little heart that nestled so closely by his own. She was awake, poor soul,

ladies and the baggage.
Now, the Mayor and his lady, who had
not been invited to the ball at which in our
last chapter other of our friends figure,
had much more time to take their whole-
some natural rest in bed, then was accorded
to people who wished to enjoy pleasure as
well as to do duty. `` It's my belief, IPeggy, my dear,'' said he, as he play-
idly pulled his night-cap over his care, ``that there will be such a ball
danced in a day or two as some of 'em has never heard the chine of''
and he was much more happy to retire to rest after partaking of a quiet
tumbler, than to figure at any other sort of amusement. Perry, for her
part, would have liked to haie show her turban nd bird of paradise at
the ball, but for the information which her husband had given her, and
which made her very grave.

sound Coach brandy, of which she and the Maojor approrel very much,
and as soon as the hands of the ``repaythcr'' pointed to half-past one,
and its interior arrangements (it had a tone quite equal to a cathedral,
its fair owner considered) kneeled forth that fatal hour, Mrs. O'Down woke
up her Major, and had as comfortable a cup of coffee prepared for him as
any made that morning in Brussels. And who is there will deny that
this worth lady's preparations betokenel affection as much as the fits
of tears and hysterics by which more sensitive females exhibited their
love, and that their partaking of this coffee, which they drank together
while the boughs were sounding the turn-out and the drums beating in the
various quarters of the town, was not more useful and to the purpose than
the outpouring of any mere sentiment could be? The consequence was,
that the MIajor appeared on parade quite trim, fresh, and avert, his well-
shnved rosy countenance, as he sat on horseback, giving cheerfulness and
confidence to the whole corpse. All the officers saluted her when the
regiment marched by the balcony on which this brave woman stood, and
waved them a cheer as they passed; and I daresay it was not from want
of courage, but from a sense of female delicacy and propriety, that she
refrained from leading the gallant -th personally into action.
On Sundays, and at periods of a solemn nature, Mrs. O'Down used to
real with great gravity out of a large volume of her uncle the Dead's her-
sons. It d been of great comfort to her on board the transport as
they were coming home, and were very nearly wrecked on their return
from the West Indics. After the regimeut's departure she betook herself
to this volume for meditation; perhaps she did not understand much of
what she was reading, and her thoughts were elsewhere: but the sleep
project, with poor Dick's nightcap there on the pillow, was quite a vain
one. So it is in the world. Jack or Donald marches away to glory with
his napsack on his shoulder, stepping out briskly to the tune of ``The
Girl I left behind me.'' It is she who remains and suffers,-and has
the leisure to think, and brood, and remember.
Knowing how useless regrets are, and how the indulgence of sentiment
only serves to ne people more miserable, Mrs. Rcbecca wisely deter-
mind to give way to to vain feelings of sorrow, and bore the parting
from her husband with quite a Spartan equanimity. Indeed Captain
Rawdon himself was much more affected at the leave-taking than the
resolute little woman to whom he bade farewell. She had mastered this
rude coarse nature; and he loved and worshipped her with all his faculties
of regard and admiration. In all his life he had never been so happy, as.
during the past few months, his wife had made him. All former delights
of turf, mess, hunting-field, and gabliug-table; all previous loves and
courtship of milliners, opera-dancers, and the like easy triumphs of the
clumsy military Adonis, were quite insipid when compared to the lawful
matrimonial pleasures which of late he had enjoyed. She had known
perpetually how to divert him; and he had found his house and her
society a thousand times more pleasant than any place or company which
he had ever frequecnted from his childhood until now. And le cursed his
past follies and extravagance, and beyond his vast outlying debts above

all, which must remain for ever as obstaeles to prevent his wife's advice-
end in the world. He had often groaned over these in drought con-
creations with Rebecca, although as a bnchelor they had never given him
any disquiet. He himself was struck with this pheuomenon. `` Hung it,''
he would say (or perhaps use a still stronger expression out of his simple
vocabulary) ` before I was married I didn't care what bills I put my name
to, and so long as MOses would wait or Levy would renew for three
months, I kept on never minding. But since I'm married, except renew-
jug of course, 1 gie you my honour I've not touched a bit of stamped
paper.''
Rebecca always knew how to conjure away these moods of melancholy.
 Why, my stupid love,'' she would say, '` we have not done with you
aunt yet. If she fails us, isn't there what you call thle Guzettc? or, stop,
when your uncle But's life drops, I have another scheme. he living his
always belonged to the younger brother, and why shouldn't you sell out
and go into the Church '' he idea of this conversion set Rawdon into
roars of laughter: you might have heard the explosion though the hotel
at midnight, and the law-haws of the great dragoon's voice. general
Tufts heard him from his quarters on the first floor above them; and
Rzebecca acted the scene with great spirit, and wrenched Rawson's first
sermon, to the immense delight of the General nt breakfast.
But these were mere by-gone days and talk. When the final news
arrived that the campaign was opened, and the troops were to more,
Ardour's gravity became such that Beck rallied him about it in a manner
which rather hurt the feelings of the Guarsmmn.  you don't suppose
1'm afraid, Beck, I should think,'' he said, with a tremor in his voice.
`But I'm a pretty good mark for a shot, and you see if it brings me
down, why I leave one and perhaps two behind me when I should wish to
provide for, as I brought 'em into the scrape. It is no laughing matter
that, MIss. C., anyways.''
Rebecca by a hundred caresscs and kind words tried to soothe the feel-
wings of the wounded lover. It was only when her vivacity and sense of
humour got the better of this sprightly creature (as they would do under
most circumstances of life indeed,) that she would break out with her
satire, but she could soon put on a demure face. `' Dearest love,'' she
said, `` do you suppose I feel nothing ?'' and, lastly lashing something
from her eyes, she looked up in her husband's face with a smile.
``Look here,'' said he.  If I drop let us see what there is for you.
I have had a pretty good run of luck here, and here's two hundred and
thirty pounds. I have got ten Napoleons in my pocket. That is as much
as I shall want; for the General pays everything like a prince; and if
I 'm hit, why you know I cost nothing. Don't cry, little woman; I may
live to vex you yet. Well, I shan't tuke either of my horses, but shall
ride the General's grey charge: it's cheaper, and I told him ice was
lame. If' I 'm done, those two ought to fetch you something. Grigg
offered ninety for the mare yesterday, before this confounded news one,

the dealers have so many bills of mine, and so I'd rather he shouldn 't go
back to England. our little mark the General gave you will fetch some-
thing, and there 's no d-d livery stable bills here as there are in London,''
Rawdon added, with a laugh.  There's that dressing-case cost me two
hundred,-that is, Owe two for it; and the gold tops and bottles must be
worth thirty or forty. Please to put that up the spot, ma'am, with my
pins, and rings, and watch and chain, and things. They cost a precious
lot of money. Miss Crawled, I know, paid a hundred down for the chain
and thicker. Gold tops and ottles, indeed dummy, I m sorry I didn't
take more now. Edward pressed on me a silver-gilt boot-jack, and I
might have had a dressing-case fitted up with a silver wrming-pay, and a
service of plate. But we must use the best of what we 'se got, Beck,
you know.''
And so, making his last dispositions, Captain Crawled, who lad seldom
thought about anything but himself, until the last few months of his life,
when Love had obtained the mastery over the dragoon, vent through the
various items of his little catalogue of effects, striving to see how they
might be turned into money for his wife's benefit, in case any accident
should befall him. He pleased himself by noting down with a pencil, in
his big school-boy handwriting, the various items of his probable property
which might be sold for his widow's advantage-as for example, " M
double-barril by Manon, say 40 guineas; my driving cloak, lined with
table fur, E50; my dwelling pistols in rosewood case, (me which I shot
Captain Maker), A20 ; my regulation saddle-hostess and shouting; my
Nature ditto,'' and so forth, over all of which articles he made Hebecca the
mistress.
Faithful to his plan of economy, the Captain dressed himself in his
oldest and shabbiest uniform and epaulets, leaving the newest behind,
under his wife's (or it might be his widow's) guardianship. And this
famous dandy of Winlsor and Hole Park went off on his campaign with
a kit as modest as that of a serjeant, and with something like a prayer on
his lips for the woman he was leaving. He took her up from the ground,
and held her in his arms for a minute, tight pressed against his strong-
beating heart. IIi face was purple and his eyes dim, as he put her down
and left her. ONe rode by his General's side, and smoked his cigar in
silence as they hastened after the troop of the General's bridge, which
preceded the; and it was not until they were some miles on their way
that he left off twirling his moustache and broke silence.
And Rebeccn, as we have said, wisely determined not to give way to
unavailing sentimentality on her husband's departure. She waved him an
adieu from the window, and stood there for a moment looking out after
he was gone. The cathedral towers and the full gables of the quaint old
houses were just beginning to blush in the sunrise. There had been no
rest for her that night. She was still in her pretty ball-dress, her fair
hair hanging somewhat out of curl on her neck, and the circles round her
eyes dark with watching. ee What a fright I seem,'' she said, examining
herself in the glass, ``and how pale this pink makes one look.I'' So she
divested herself of this pink raiment; in doing which a note fell out for

her course, which she picked up with  smile, and locked into her dressing-
box. And then she put her bouquet of the ball into a glass of water, and
went to bed, and slept very comfortably.

The town was quite quiet when she woke up at ten o'clock, and cartoon
of coffee, very requisite and comfortable after the exhaustion and grief of
the morning's occurrences.
This meal over, she resumed honest Rawson's caleulations of the night
previous, and surveyed her position. Should the worst befal, all things
considered, she was pretty well to do. There were her own trinkets and
trousseau, in addition to those which her husband had let behind. a-
lion's generosity, when they were first married, has already been described
and lauded. Besides these, and the little more, the General, her slave and
worshipper, had made her any very handsome resents in the shape of
cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a bankrupt French general's lady,
and numerous tributcs from the jeweller' shops, all of which betokened her
admirer's taste and wealth. As for ``tickers,'' as poor Brandon called watches,
her apartments were alive with their clicking. for, happening to mention
one night that mrs, which Rawdon had given to her, was of English work-
kinship, and went ill, on the very next morning there came to her a little
about market Leroy, with a chain and cover charmingly sat with turquoise,
and another signed Request, which was covered with pearls, and yet
scarcely bigger than a half-corn. General Tufts had bought out, and
Captain Borne had gnllantly presently the other. Mrs. Borne had
no watch, though, to lo George justice, she might have had one for the
asking, and the Honourable Mrs. Tufts in England had an old instrument
of her mother's that might have served for the plate warming-pan which
Rawdon talked about. If Masses. Well and James were to publish a
list of the purchasers of all the trinkets which they sell, how surprised
would some lilies be; and if all these ornaments went to gentlemen's
lawful wives and daughters, what a profusion of jewellery there would be
exhibited in the genteeclest homes of Vanity Fair l

without a pungent feeling of triumph and self-satisfaction, that should air-
cumstances occur, she might reckon on six or seven hundred pounds nt tlc
very least, to begin the world with: and she passed the morning disposing,
ordering, looking out, and looking up her properties in the most agreeable
manner. Among the notes in Watson's pocket-book, was a draft for
twenty pounds on Borne's banker. This made her think about MRs.
Borne. `I will go and get the draft washed,'' she said, ``and pay a
visit afterwards to poor little May.'' If this is a novel without a hero,
nt least let us lay claim to a heroine. No man in the bRitish army which
has marched away, not the great duke himself, could be more cool or cold-
elected in the presence of doubts and difficulties, than the indomitable little
side-de-camp's wife.
And there was another of our acquaintances who was also to be Soft
behind, a non-combatant, and whose emotions and behaviour we have
therefore a right to know. This was our friend the ex-collection of
Boggleywollah, whose rest was broken, like other people's, by the sound-
in of the boughs in the early morning. Being a great sleeper, and fond
of his bed, it is possible he would have soothed on until his usual hour of
rising in the forenoon, in spite of all the drums, boughs, and bagpipes in
the British army, but for an interruption, which did not come from George
Borne, who shared Joy's quarters with him, and was as usual occupied
too much with his own affairs, or with grief at parting with his wife, to
think of taking leave of his slumhering brother-in-law-it was not George,
we say, who interposed between Joy Sedley and sleep, but Captain Doing,
who came and roused him up, insisting on shaking hands with him before
his departure.
 Very kind of you,'' said Joy, yawning, and wishing the Captain at
the deuce.
I-I didn't like to go off without saying good-bye, you know,'' Do-
bin said in a very incoherent manner; `` because you know some of us
mayn't come back again, and I like to see you all well and-and that sort
of thing, you know.''
 What do you men ?'' Joy asked, rubbing his eyes. The Captain did
not in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the night-cap,
about whom he professed to have such a tender interest. The lypocrite
was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of George's
npartments, striding about the room, upsetting the chairs, beating the
tattoo, biting his nails, and showing other signs of great inward emotion.
Joy had always had rather a mean opinion of the Captain, and now
began to think his courage was somewhat equirocnl.  What is it I can
do for you, Doing%'' he said in a sarcastic tone.
I tell you what you can do,'' the Captain replied, coming up to the
bed; `` we march in a quarter of an hour, Sedley, and neither George nor

you ascertain how things go. YOu are to stay here and watch over your
sister, and comfort her, and she that no harm comes to her. If anything

and you will promise me on your word that you will never desert her. I
know you won't: as far as money goes you were always free enough with
the. Do you want any? I mean, have you enough gold to take you

 of speak like a man of spirit, Joys,'' the other answered good-
naturedly, `` and I am glad that George can leave her in such good hands.
So I may gie him your word of honour, may I, that in case of extremity
you will stand by her'
Of course, of course,'' answered MIr. Joy, whose generosity in money
matters Doing estimate quite correct.
'And you'll see her safe out of Hrussels in the event of a defeat?'
`:`A defeat D- it, Sir, it's impossible. Don't try and frighten ne,'' the
hero cried from his bed; and Doing's mind was thus perfectly set at ease
now that Joy had spoken out so resolutely respecting his conduct to his
sister. ``At least,'' thought the Captain, ``there will be a retreat scented
for her in case the worst should ensue.''
If Captain Doing expected to get any personal comfort and satisfied-
lion from having one more view of Hamlin before the regiment marched away,
his selfishness was puuished just as such odious egotism deserved to be.
The door of Joy's bed-room opened into the sitting-room which was
common to the family party, and opposite the door was that of hmelia's
chamber. The boughs and wakened everybody: there was no use in
concealment now. George's servant was packing in this room: Borne
coming in and out of the contiguous bed-room, flinging to the man such
articles as he thought fit to carry on the campaign. And presently
Doing had the opportunity which his heart coveted, and he got sight of
Amelia's face once more. But what a face it was So white, so wild
and despair-stricken, that the remembrance of it haunted him afterwards
like a crime, and the sight smote im with inexpressible pangs of longing
and pity.
She was wrapped in a white morning dress, her hair falling on her
shoulders, and her large eyes fixed and without light. By way of helping
on the preparations for the departure, and showing that she too could be
useful at a moment so critical, this poor soul had taken up a sash of
George's from the drawers whereon it lay, and followed him to and fro
with the sash in her hand, looking on mutely as his packing proceeded.
She came out and stood, leaning at the wall, holding this sash against her
bosom, from which the heavy net of crimson dropped like a large stain of
blood. Our gentle-hearted Captain felt a guilty shook as he looked at
her. `Good God,'' thought he, `` and is it grief like this I dared to pry
into'' And there was no help: no means to soothe and comfort this
helpless, speechless misery. Hle stool for a moment and looked at her,
powerless and torn with pity, s a parent regards an infant in pain.
At last, George took Emmy's hand, and led her back into the bed-room,
from whence he came out alone. The parting has taken place in that
moment, and he was gone.
264
vANITY FAIR.
Thank Heaven that is over,'' George thought, bounding down the stair,
his sword under his arm, and as he ran swiftly to the alarm-ground, where
the regiment was mustered, and whither trooped men and officers hurrying
from their billets, his pulse was throbbing and his cheeks flushed: the
great game of war was going to be played, and the one of the players.
What a fierce excitement of doubt, hope, and pleasure1 What tremendous
hazards of loss or gain What were all the games of chance he had ever
played compared to this one? Into all contents requiring athletic skill
and courage, the young man, from is boyhood upwards, had flung him-
self with all his might. The champion of his school and his regiment,
the bravo of his companions had followed him everywhere; from the
boys' cricket-match to the garrison-races, he had won a hundred of
triumphs; and wherever he went, women and men had admired and
envied him. What qualities are there for which a man gets so speedy a
return of applause, as those of bodily superiority, activity, and aloud
Time out of mind strength and courage have been the theme of birds and
romances; and from the story of Tory down to to-day, poetry has always
chosen a soldier for a hero. I wonder is it because men are cowurds in
heart that they admire bravery so much, and place military valour so far
beyond every other quality for reward and worship:
So, at the sound of the stirring all to battle, George jumped away
from the gentle arms in which he had been dallying; not without a feeling
of shame (although his wife's hold on him had been but feeble), that he
should have been detained there so long. The same feeling of eagerness
and excitement was amongst all those friends of his of whom we have
had occasional glimpses, from the stout senior Major, who led the regiment
into action, to little Stubble, the Ensign, who was to bear its colours on
that day.
The sun was just rising as the march began-it was a gllant sight-
the band led the column, playing the regimentul march-then came the
Major in command, riding upon Pyramus, his stout charge-then marched
the grenadiers, their captain at their head; in the centre were the colours,
borne by the senior and junior Lnsigns-then George came marcling at the
head of his company. He looked up, and smiled at Amelias, and passed
on; and even the sound of the music died away.

Being's interruption and the occur-
chance of the morning, Joy nevertheless
refined for many hours in bed, wake-
ful and rolling about there until his
usual hour of rising had arrived. The sun was high in the heavens, and
our gallant friends of the -th miles on their march, before the civility
appeared in his lowered dressing-gown at breakfast.
About George's absence, his brother-in-law was very easy in mind.
Perhaps Joy was rather pleased in his heart the Borne was gone, for
during george's presence, the other had played but a very seeondary part
in the household, and Borne did not scruple to show his contempt for
the stout civility. But Emmy had always been good and attentive to
him. It was she who ministered to his comforts, who superintend the
dishes that he liked, who walked or rode with him (as she had many, too
many, opportunities of doing, for where was George ) and who interposed
her sweet kind face between his anger and her husband's scorn. Many
timid remonstrances had she uttered to George in behalf of her brother.
But the latter in his trenchnt way cut these entreaties short. I'm an
honest man,'' he said, ``and if I have a feeling I show it, as an honest an
will. How the deuce, my dear, would you have me behave respectfully
to such a fool as your brother'' So Joy was pleased with George'a
absence. HIs plain hat, and gloves on a sideboard, and the idea that
the owner was away, caused so I don't know what secret thrill of plan-
sure. ``He won't be troubling me this morning,'' Joy thought, `` with his
dignified airs and his impudence.''
Put the Captain's hat into the ante-room,'' he said, to Isidor the
servant,
Perhaps he won't want it again,'' replied the lackey, looking know-
ingly at his master. He hated George too, whose insolenuce towards him
was quite of the English sort.
266
vANITY AIR.
:And ask if Madam is coming to breakfast,'' Mr. Sedley said with
great majesty, ashamed to enter with a servant upon the subject of his
dislike for George. The truth is, he hal abused his brother to the valet
a score of times before.
Alas Madam could not come to breakfast, and cut the mariners that
Mr. Joy liked. Madam was a great deal too ill, and had been in a
frightful state ever since her husband's departure, so her bonne said. Joy
showed his sympathy, by pouring her out a large cup of ten. It was his
way of exshibiting kindness: and he improed on this; he not only sent
her breakfast, but he bethought him what delicacies she would most like
for dinner.
Isidor, the valet, had looked on very sulkil, while Borne's
servant was disposing of his master's baggnge previous to the Captain's
departure : for in the first place he hated Mr. Borne, whose conduct to
him, and to all inferiors, was generally orerbearing, (nor does the point-
mental domestic like to be treated with insolence as our own better-tempered
servants do;) and secondly, he was angry that so many valuable should e
removed from under his hands, to fall into other people's possession when
the English discomfiture should arrive. Of this defeat he and a st
number of other persons in Brussels and Belgium did not make the
slightest doubt. The almost universal belief was, that the Emperor would
divide the Russian and English armics, annihilate one after the other, and
march into Brussels before three days were her; when all the moveables
of his present masters, who would be killed, or fugitives, or prisoners,
would lawfully become the property of Monsieur Isidor.
As he helped Joy through his toilsome and complicated daily toilette,
this faithful servant would calculate what he should do with the very
articles with which he was dccorating his master's person. II would
make a present of the silver essence-bottles and toilet knicknaceks to a
young lady of whom he was fond; and keep the English country and the
large ruby pin for himself. It would look very smart upon one of the
fine frilled shirts, which, with the gold-laced cap and the froggel frock
coat, that might easily be cut down to suit lis shape, and the Captain's
gold-headed cane, and the great double ring with the rubies, which he
would have made into a pair of beautiful earrings, he calculated would
make a perfect Adonis of himself, and render Mademoiselle Reine an easy
prey. ` How those sleeve-buttons will suit me,'' thought he, as he fixed
n pair on the Fat proud wrists of Mr. Sedley. I long for sleeve-buttons;

effect they will make in the Ale-Verse. So while Monsieur Isidor with

part of Joy's face, his imagination was rambling along the Green avenue,
dressed out in a dogged coat and lace, and in company with Mademoiselle
Reine ; he was loitering in spirit on the banks, and examining the barges
sailing slowly under the cool shadows of the trees by the canal, or fresh-
ing himself with a mug of Far at the bench of a beer-house on the road
to Awaken.
But Mr. Joseph Sedley, luckily for his own peace, no more knew what

was passing in his domestic's mind than the respected reader and I suspect
what John or Mary, whose ages we pay, think of ourselves. WHat our
servants think of us!-Did we know what our intimates and dear real-
tions thought of us, we should live in a world that we should be glad
to quit, and in a frame of mind and a constant terror, that would be
perfectly unbearable. So Joy's man was marking his victim down, as
you see one of Mr. Painter's assistants in Lcadenhall-street oruament
an unconscious turtle with a placard of which is written, `` Soup
to-morrow,''
Amelia's attendant was much less selfishly disposed. Few dependent
could come near that kind and gentle creature without paying their usual
tribute of loyalty and affection to her sweet and affectionate nature. And
it is a fact that hamlin, the cook, consoled her mistress more than any-
body whom she saw on this wretched morning; for when she found how
Amelia remained for hours, silent, motionless, and haggard, by the win-
low in which she had placed herself to watch the last bonnets of the
column as it marched away, the honest girl took the lady's hand, and said,
Tenee, MAdame, est-ce t'il 'est pas asks a large, on lone ad moi '
with which she burst into tears, and Amelia falling into her arms, did
likewise, and so each pitied and soothed the other.
Several times during the forenoon Mr. Joy's Isidor went from his long-
wings into the town, and to the gates of the hotels and lodging-houses
round about the lark, where the English were congregated, and there
mingling with other valets, couriers, und glances, gathered such news as
was abroad, and brought back bulletins for his master's information.
Almost all these gentlemen were in heart partisans of the Emperor, and
had their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign. The Emperor's
proclamation from Avenues had been distributed everywhere plentifully in
Brusscls. `Soldier'' it said, ``this is the anniversary of Mnrcengo wanDered-
land, by which the destinies of Europe were twice decided. Then, as after
Austerlitz, as after Warm, we were too generous. We believed in the
oaths and promises of princes whom we suffered to remain upon their
throne. Let us march once more to meet them. We and they, are we not
still the same men Soldiers these same k'russians who are so arroguant
to-day, were three to one against you at Jenn, and six to one nt Moment-
rail. Those among you who were prisoners in England can tell their
comrades what frightful torments they suffered on brown the English
hulks. Mndmen l a moment of prosperity has blinded them, and if they
enter into fRance it will be to find a grave there'' But the partisans
of the French prophesied n more speedy determination of the Emperor's
enemies than this; and it was agreed on all hands that Prussinns and
British would never return except as prisoners in the rear of the conquer-
ing army.
These opinions in the course of the day were brought to operate upon
MIr. Sedley. He was told that the Duke of Wcllington had gone to try
and rally his army, the advance of which had been utterly crushed the
night before.

PITY FAIn.
 Crushed, pshal'' said Joy, hose heart was pretty stout ut breakfast-
time. `The Duke has gone to beat the Emperor as he has beaten all his
general before.''
His papers are burned, his effects are removed, and his quarters are
being got ready for the Duke of Dramatic,'' Joy's inforant replies. I

packing up everything. His Grace has fled already, and the Duchess is
only writing to see the plate packed to join the King of France at

dulity.

Duke de Berry is taken prisoner. Those who wish to be safe hnl better
go soon, for the dykes will be open to-morrow, and who can fly when the
whole country is under water2''
Nonsense, Sir, we are three to one, Sir, against any force Bony can
bring in the field,'' Mr. Sedley objected; ``the Austrians and the Russians
are on their march. He must, he shall be crushed,'' Joy said, clapping his
hand on the table.
 The Prussians were three to one at Lena, and i took their army and
kingdom ita week. They were six to one at Montmirail, and he scattered
them like sheep. The Austrian army is coming, but with the Press and
the King of some at its head; and the Russians, bah . the Russians will
withdraw. No quarter is to be given to the ENglish, on account of their
cruelty to our brave on board the infamous pontoons. Look here, here
it is in black and white. Here's the proclamation of his Majesty the
Emperor and King,'' said the now declared partisan of Napoleon, and
taking the document from his pocket, Isidor sternly thrust it into his
master's face, and already looked upon the rugged coat and valuable as
his own spoil.
Joy was, if not seriously alarmed as yet, at least considerably disturbed
in mind.  Gie me my coat and cap, air,'' sail he, ``and follow me. I
will go myself and learn the truth of these reports.'' Isidor was furious as
Job it on the braidel frock. `Minor had better not wear that military
coat,'' said he; ``the EFrenchmen have sworn not to give quarter to a single
British soldier.''
Silence, Sirrall'' said Joy, with a resolute countenance still, and thrust
his arm into the sleep with indomitable resolution, in the performance of
which heroic act he was found by Mrs. Rawdon Crawled, who it this
juncture come up to visit melia, and entered without ringing at the ante-
chamber door.
Rebeeca as dressed very neatly and stately, as usual; her quiet sleep
after Rawson's departure had refreshed her, and her pink smiling cheeks
were quite pleasant to look at, in a town and on a day when everybody
else's countenance ore the appearance of the deepest anxiety and gloom.
She laughed at the attitude in which Joy was discovered, and the struggles
and convulsions with which the stout gentleman thrust himself into the
braided coat.

in plunging into the coat, and came forward blushing and stuttering out
excuses to his fir visitor. '`How was she after the events of the morning

appeared into his master's adjacent bed-room, bear off the floirered
dressing-gown.
e How good of you to ask,'' said she, pressing one of his hands in both
her own. `` How cool and collected you look when everybody else is
frightened. How is our der little Emma It must have been an
awful, awful parting.''
tRemendous,'' Joy said.
You men can bear anything,'' replied the lady. Parting or danger
are nothing to you. Own now that you were going to join the army, and
leave us to our fate. I know you were-something tells me you were. I
was so frightened, when the thought came into my head (for I do some-
times think of you when I am alone, Mr. Joseph l), that I ran off imme-
lately to beg and entreat you not to fly from us,''
This speech might be interpreted, ``My dear Sir, should an accident
befall the army, and s retreat be necessary, you have a very comfortable

carriage, is well I propose to take a seat.'' I don't know whether Jlos
understood the words in this sense. But he was profoundly mortified by
the lady's inattention to him, during their stay at Brussels. He had never
been presented to any of Rawdon Crawled's great acquaintances: he had
scarcely be invited to cbeccan's parties; for he was too timid to play
much, and his presence bored George and Rawson equally, who neither of
them, perhaps, liked to have a witness of the amusements in which the
pair chose to indulge. ``Ah!'' thought Joy, `' now she wants me she comes
to me. When there is nobody else in the way she can think about old
Joseph Sedley I'' But besides these doubts he felt flattered ut the idea
lebecca expressed of his courage.
DIe blushed a good deal, and put on an air of importance. I should
like to see the action,'' e said. Every man of any spirit would, you
know. I 've seen a little service in India, but nothing on this grand
scale.''
 You men would sacrifice anything for a pleasure,'' Rebecca answered.
Captain Crawled left me this morning as gay as if he was going to a
hunting party. What does he care What do any of you care for the
agonies and torturcs of a poor forsaken woman' (I wonder whether he
could really have been going to the troops, this great lazy gourmand ?)
Oh. dear Mr. Sedley, I have come to you for comfort-for consolation.
I hae been on my knees all the morning. I tremble at the frightful
danger into which our husbands, our friends, our brave droops and lies,
are rushing. And I come here for shelter, and find another of my friends-
the last remaining to me-bent upon plunging into the dreadful scene''
 MY dear Madam,'' Joy replied, now beginning to be quite soothed.
Don't be alarmed. I only said I should like to go-what bBriton would
not? But my duty keeps me here: I can't leave that poor creature in
the next room.'' And he pointed with his finger to the door of the
chamber in which Amelia was.
 Good noble brother'' Icbcce said, putting her handkerchief to her
eyes, and smelling the cup-de-cologne with which it was scented.`'I
have done you injustice: you have got a heart. I thought you had not.''
 O, upon my honour'' Joy said, making a motion as if he would lay
his hand upon the spot in question. ' You do me injustice, indeed you
do-my dear Mrs. Crawled.''
 I do, now your heart is true to your sister. But I remember two
years ago-when it was false to me:'' Icbecca said, fixing her eyes upon
him for an instant, and then turning away into the window.
Joy blushed violently. That organ which he was accused by Breeze
of not possessing began to thump tumultuously. He recalled the days
when he had fled from her, and the passion which had once inflamed him
-the days when he had driven her in his curricle : when she hnl knit the
green purse for him: when he had sat enraptured gazing at her white
arms, and bright eyes.
 I know you think me ungrateful,'' Rebecca continued, coming out of
the window, and once more looking at him and addressing him in a low
tremulous voice.  Your coldness, your averted looks, your manner hen
we have met of late-when i came in just now, all proved it to e. But

were there no reasons why I should avoid you Let your own heart
answer that question. Do you think my husband was too much inclined
to welcome you `he only unkind words I have ever had from him (I
will do Captain CRawled that justice) have been about you-and most
cruel, cruel words they were.''
 Good gracious what have I lone'' asked Joy in a flurry of pleasure
and perplexity; ``' what have I done-to-to-- 2''
Is jealousy nothing P'' said lebeeca. e He makes me miserable
about you. And whatever it might have been once-my heart is all his.
I am innocent now. Am I not, MIr. Sedley P''
All Joy's blood mingled with delight, as he surveyed this victim to his
ttractions. A few adroit words, one or two knowing tender glances of the
eyes, and his heart was inflamed again and his doubts and suspicions
forgotten. From Solomon downwards, have not wiser men than he been
cajoled and befooled by women weRe the worst comes to the worst,''
Beck thought, ``my retreat is secure; and I have a right-hand seat in
the brouch,''
There is no knowing into what declarations of love and ardour the
tumultuous passions of Mr. Joseph might have led him, if Isidor the valet
had not made his re-appearance at this minute, and begun to busy himself
about the domestic affairs. Joy, who was just going to gasp out an avowal,
choked almost with the emotion that he was obliged to restrain. Rebecca
too bethought her that it was time she should go in and comfort her
dearest Amelia. ``a reoir,'' she said, kissing her hand to MIr. Joseph,
and tapped gently at the door of his sister's apartment. As she entered
and closed the door on herself, he sank down in a chair, and gazed and
sighed and pufed portentously. ` That out is very tight for More,''
Isidor said, still having his eye on the frogs; but his master heard him
not : his thoughts were elsewhere: now glowing, maddening, upon the
contemplation of the enchanting became : anon shrinking guiltily before
the vision of the jealous down Crawled, with his curling, fierce must-
actions, and his terrible dwelling pistols longed and locked.
Rebecca's appearance struck Amelia with terror, and made her shrink
back. It recalled her to the world and the remembrance of yesterday.
In the overpowering fears about to-morrow she and forgotten Rcbecca,--
jealousy-everything except that her husband was gone and was in
danger. Until this dauntless worldling came in and broke the spell, and
lifted the latch, we too have forbore to enter into that sad chamber.
How long hal that poor girl been on her knees what hours of spccclless
prayer and bitter prostration had she passed there he war-chronielers
who write brilliant stories of light and triumph scarcely tell us of these.
These are too mean parts of the parent: and you don't hear windows'

After the first movement of terror in Amneliu's mind-when Rebecca'a

FANCY FAIR.
feeling of anger succeeded, and from being deadly pale before, her face
flushed up red, and she returned Rebecca's look after a moment with a
steadiness which surprised and somewhat abashed her rival.
 Denrest Amelia, you are very unwell,'' the visitor said, putting forth
her hand to take Amelia's. e What is it? I could not rest until I knew
how you were.''
Anelia drew back her hand-never since her life began had that gentle
soul refused to believe or to answer any demonstration of good-will or
affection. But she drew back her hand, and trembled all over.  Why
are you here, Rebecca'' she said, still looking at her solemnly with her
large eyes. These glances troubled her visitor.
 She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball,'' Rebeeca
thought.  Don't be agitated, dear Amelia,'' she said, looking down.
I came but to see if I could-if you were well,''
`Are you well%'' said Amelia. ``I dare say you are. You don't love
your husband. YOu would not be here if you did. Tell me, Rebecca,
lid I ever do you anything but kindness''
e Indeed, Amelia, no,'' the other said, still hanging down her head.
 When you were quite poor, who was it that befriended you Was I
not a sister to you? you saw us all in happier days before he married
me. I was all in all then to him; or would he had given up his fortune,
his family, as he nobly did to make me happy? Why did you come
between my love und me Who sent you to separate those whom God
joined, and take my darling's heart from me-my own husband Do
you think you could love him as I did His love was everything to me.
You knew it, and wanted to rob me of it. FOr shame, became; bad and
wicked woman-false friend and false wife,''
`Amelia, I protest before God, I have done my husband no wrong,''
Rebecca said, turning from her.
Have you done me no wrong, RebeccaP You did not succeed, but
you tried. Ask your heart if you did not''
She knows nothing, Rebecca thought.

he poor girl spoke these words with a spirit and volubility which
Rebecca had never before seen in her, and before which the latter was
quite dumb.  But what have I done to you,'' she continued in a more
pitiful tone, ``that you should try and take him from me? I had him
but for six weeks. You might have spared me those, Rebecca. And yet,
from the very first day of our wedding, you came and blighted it. Now
he is gone, are you come to see how unhappy I amP'' Se continued,
 You made me wretched enough for the past fortnight: you might have
spared me to-day,''
I-I never came here,'' interposed Rebeeca, '' with unlucky truth,''
No. You didn't come. You took him away. hreyou come to fetch
him from me?'' she continued in a wilder tone.  He was here, but he is
gone now. There on that very sofa he sat. Don't touch it. We sat
and talked there. I was on his knee, and my arms were round his neck,

and we sail ` Our Father.' as, he was here: and they came and took
him away, but e promised me to come back,''
He will come back, my dear,'' sail Rebecca, touched in spite of
herself.
`Look,'' said Amelia, ` this is his sash-isn't it a pretty colour:'' and
she took up the fringe and kissed it. She had tied it round her waist and
some part of the day. She had forgotten her anger, her jealousy, the very
presence of her rival seemingly. For she walked silently and almost with
a smile on lcr face, towards the bed, and began to smooth down George's
pillow.
Rcbeccn walked, too, silently away. `` How is Mmelia ?'' asked Joy, who
still held his position in the chair.
here should e somebody with her,'' said Rebecca. :I think she is
very unwell'' and she went away with a very grave face, refusing Mr,
Sedley's entreaties that she would stay and partuke of the early dinner
which he had ordered.
Release was of a good-nature and obliging disposition; and she liked
Amelin rather than otherwise. Even her hard words, reproachful as they
were, were complimentary-the groans of a person stinging under defeat.
Meeting Mrs. O'Down, whom the Dead's sermons and by no means come-
forced, and who was walking very disconsolately in the Park, Rebeeea
nccosted the latter, rather to the surprise of the Mnjor's wife, who was not
accustomed to such marks of politeness from Mrs. Rawdon Crawled, and
informing her that poor little MRs. Borne was in a desperate condition,
and almost and with grief, sent off the good-natured Irishwoman straight
to see if she would console her young favourite.
I've cares of my own enough,'' Mrs. O'Down said, gravely, '` and I
thought poor Amclia would be little wanting for company this day. bUt
if he's so bad as you say, and you can't attend to her, who used to be so
fond of her, faith I 'll see if I can be of service. And so good morning to
ye, Mind ;'' with which speech and a toss of her head, the lady of the
repayther took a farewell of Mrs. Crawled, whose company she by no
means courted.
Beck watched her darling off, with a smile on her lip. She had the
keenest sense of humour, and the Pnrthian look which the retreating Mrs.
O'Down flung over her shoulder almost upset MRs. Crawled's gravity.
 My service to ye, me fine Madam, and I'm glad to see ye so
cheerful,'' thought Pcggy. ``It 's not you that will cry your eyes out
with grief, any way,'' And with this she passed on, and speedily found
her way to Mrs. Borne's lodgings.
The poor soul was still at the bedside, where Rehecca had left her, and
stood almost crazy with grief. The Mayor's wife, n stronger minded
woman, endeavoured her best to comfort her young friend,  you must
bear no, Amelia, dear,'' she said kindly, `` for le mustn't fill you ill when
he sends for you after the victory. It's not you are the only woman that
are in the hands of God this day,''
I know that. I am very wicked, very weak,'' Amelia sail. She
knew her own weakness well enough. The presence of the more resolute

friend checked it, however: and she was the better of this control and
company. he went on till two o'clock; their hearts were with the
column as it marched further and further away. Dreadful doubt and
anguish-prayers and fears and griefs unspeakable-followed the regimeut.
It was the women's tribute to the war. It takes both like, and takes
the blood of the men, and the tears of the women.
At half-past two an event occurred of daily importance to Mr. Joseph:
the dinner hour married. Warriors my fight and perish, but he must
in. He came into Amelia's room to see if he could coax her to share
that meal.  Try,'' said he; `'the soup is very good. Do try, Emmy,''
and he kissed her hand. eXcept when she was married, he had not done
so much for years before.  You are very good and kind, Joseph,'' she
said.  Everybody is, but, if you please, I ill stay in my room to-day.''
The savour of the soup, however, was agreeable to Mrs. O'Down's
nostrils: and she thought she would bear Mr. Joy company. So the two
sat down to their meal.  God bless the meat,'' said the Mayor's wife,
solemnly: she was thinking of her honest Sick, riding at the head of his
argument :  'Tis but a bad dinner those poor boys will get to-day,'' she
sill, with a sigh, and then, like a philosopher, fell to.
Joy's spirits rose with his meal. He would drink the regiment's health;
or, indeed, take any other excuse to indulge in a glass of champagne.
eWe 'Il drink to O'Down and the brave -th,'' said he, bowing gal-
lantly to his guest.  Hey, Mrs. O'Don. TIll Mrs. O'Down's glass,
Isidor.''
But all of a sudden, Isidor started, and the MIajor's wife laid down her
knife and fork. The windows of the room were open, and looked south-
ward, and a dull distant sound came over the sun-lighted roofs from that
direction. : What is it'' said Joy. :Why don't you pour, you rscal ''
 C'est le he,'' said Isidor, running to the balcony.
 God defend us; it's caunon 1'' MRs. O'Down cried, starting up, and
followed too to the window. A thousand pale and anxious faces might
have been seen looking from other casements. And presently it seemed
as if the whole population of the city rushed into the streets.

he never beheld-and

please God never shall

hurry and alarm, as the
which Brussels present.
Crowds rushed to the
Nurse gate, from which
direction the noise pro-
needed, and many rose
along the level classes,
to he in advance of any
intelligence from the
ary. Each man asked
his neighbour for news;
and even great English lords and ladies condescended to speak to persons
whom they did not know. The friends of the French went abroad, wild with
excitement, and prophecying the triumph of their Emperor. The men-
chants close their shops, and came out to swell the general chorus of alarm
and clamour. Women rushed to the churches, and crowded the chapels, and
knelt and prayed on the flags and steps. The dull sound of the cannon went
on rolling, rolling. Presently carriages with travellers began to leave the
town, galloping away by the Ghent bnrrier. The prophecies of the French
partisans head to pass for facts. ``He has cut the armies in two,'' it was
said. DIe is marching straight on Brussels. He will overpower th
English, and be here to-night.''  HE will overpower the English,''
shrieked Silver to his master, ``and will be here to-night.'' The man
bounded in and out from the lodgings to the street, always returning with
some fresh particulars of disaster. Joy's face grew paler and paler.
Alarm began to take entire possession of the stout civility. All the
champagne he drank brought no courage to him. Before sunset he was
worked up to such a pitch of nervousness as gratified his friend Isidor to
behold, who now counted surely upon the spoils of the owner of the laced
coat.
The women were away all this time. After hearing the firing for a
moment, the stout Major's wife bethought her of her friend in the next
chamber, and ran in to watch, and if possible to console, Amelia. The
idea that she had that helpless and gentle creature to protect, gave
additional strength to the natural courage of the honest Irislwoman. She

passed five hours by her friend's side, sceptics in remonstrance, some-
times talking cheerfully, oftener in silence, and terrified mental supplied-
lion. I never let go her hand once,'' said the stout lady afterwards,
`until after sunset, when the firing was over.'' Painted, the loune, was
on her knees at church hard by, praying for son omme a elle.
When the noise of the cannonating was over, MRs. O'dOwn issued out of
Mmelia's room into the parlour adjoining, where Joy sat with two emptied
flasks, and courage entirely gone. Once or twice he had entered into his
sister's bed-room, looking very much alarmed, and as if he would say
something. But the ajor's wife kept her place, and he went away with-
out lisburthening himself of his speech. He was ashamed to tell her that
he wanted to fly.
But when she made her appearance in the dining-room, where he sat
in the twilight in the cheerless company of his empty league-bottles,
he began to open his mind to her.
Mrs. O'Down,'' he soil, '` hadn't you better get Amelia red ?''
`Are you going to take her out a walk '' said the Mayor's lady;
sure she's too weak to stir,''
I--I'e ordered the carriage,'' he said,  and-all post-horses;
Isidor is gone for them,'' Joy continued.

she better on her bed% I've just got her to lie down.''
Get her up,'' said Joy ; '`she must get up, i say:'' and he stamped
his foot energetically.  `I say the horses are ordered-yes, the horses are
ordered. It's all over, and-''
 And what'' asked Mrs. O'Down.
i'm off for Ghent,'' Joy answered. : Everybody is going; there'a
place for you. We shall start in half-an-hour.''
The Mayor's wife looked at him with infinite scorn. ` Don't move till
O'Down gives me the route,'' said she. : You may go if you like, Mr.
Sedley; but, faith, Amelia and I stop here.''
tHe shall go,'' said Joy, with another stamp of his foot. Mrs. O'Down
put herself with arms ukimbo before the bed-room door.
`Is it her mother you're going to take her to 2'' she said; '` or do you
want to go to Mamma yourself, Mr. Sedley? Good morning- pleasant
journey to ye, sir. Bon voyage, as they say, and take my counsel, and
have of them mustachios, or they'll bring you into mischief.''
D-n I'' yelled out Joy, wild with fear, age, and mortification; and
Isidor came in at this juncture, swearing in his turn. Pas de chapter,
aaerehleu '' hissed out the furious domestic. All the horses were gone.
Joy was not the only man in Brussels seized with panic that day.
But Joy's fears, great and cruel and they were already, were destined to
increase to an almost frantic pitch before the night was over. It has been
mentioned ho Painted, the one, had on love d elle, also in the ranks
of the any that had gone out to meet the Emperor Napoleon. This
lover was a native of Brussels, and a Belgian hussar. The troop of his
nation signalized themselves in this was for anything but courage, and
young Van Autumn, Painter's admirers, was too good a soldier to disobey
his Colonel's orders to run away. Whilst in garrison at brussels young

Regular (he had been on in the revolutionary times) found his great
comfort, and passed almost all his leisure moments in Painter's kitchen;
and it was with pockets and holstere crammed full of good things from
her ladder, that he had taken leave of his weeping sweetheart, to proceed
upon the campaign a few days elore.
As far as his regiment was concerned, this cnmpaign was over now.
They had forced a part of the division under the command of his Sovereign
apparent; the Prince of Orange, and as respected length of swords and
ustachios, and the richness of uniform and equipments, leagues and
his comrades looked to be as gullant a body of men as ever trumpets
sounded for.
WHen New dashed upon the advance of the alliel troops, carrying one
position after the other, until the arrival of the great body of the British
anne from Brussels changed the aspect of the combat of uatre Brass, the
squadrons along which Regular rose showed the greatest activity in
retreating before the french, and were dislodged from one post and another
which they occupied with perfect alacrity on their part. Their movements
were only checked by the advance of the British in their rceur. thus
force to halt, the enemy's rivalry (whose bloothirsty obstinacy cannot
be too severely reprehnded) had at length an opportunity of coming to
close quarters with the brave REligions before them; who preferred to
encounter the British rather than the French, and at once turning tail rode
through the english regiments that were behind them, and scattered in all
directions. The regiment in fact did not exist any more. It wasnowhere.
It had no head quarters. Regular found himself galloping many miles from
the field of action, entirely alone; and whither should he fly for refuge so
naturally us to that kitchen and those faithful arms in which genuine had
so often welcomed him?
At some ten o'clock the clinging of a sabre might have been heard up
the stair of the house where the Osbornes occupied n storey in the cob-
oriental fashion. A knock might have been heard at the kitchen door;
and poor Painted, come back iron church, fainted almost with terror as
she opened it and saw before her her haggard hussar. He looked as pale
as the midnight dragoon who came to disturb Leonoff. Pnuliue would
have screamed, but that her cry would have called her masters, and dis-
covered her friend. She stifled her scream, then, and lending her her
into the kitchen, gave him beer, and the choice bits from the dinner, which
Joy had not had the heart to taste. The hussar showed he was no ghost
by the prodigious quantity of less und beer which he devoured-and
during the mouthfuls he told his tale of disaster.
His regiment had performed prodigies of courage, and had withstood
for a while the onset of the whole reach army. But they were over-
welcome at last, as was the whole British army by this time. New
destroyed each regiment as it came. The bElgian in vain interposed
to prevent the butchery of the English. The Brunswvickers were routed
and had fled-their Duke was killed. It was a general delicate. He
sought to drown his sorrow for the defect in floods of beer.
Isidor, who had come into the kitchen, heard the conversation, and
rushed out to inform his master.  `It is all over,'' he shrieked to His.
278
VANITY FAR.
mEmory Duke is a prisoner; the Duke of Brunswick is killed ; the British
army is in full flight; there is only one man escape, and he is in the
kitchen now-come and hear him.'' So Joy tottered into that apartment
where Regular still sat on the kitchen-table, and clung fast to his flagon

better. In the best French which he could muster, and which was in south
of a very ungrammatical sort, Joy besought the hussar to tell his tale.
The disnsters deepened as Refuse spoke. He was the only man of his
regiment not slain on the field. He had seen the Duke of Brunswick full,
the black hussars fly, the Ecossais wounded down by the cannon.
``And the -th?'' gasped Joy.
Cut in pieces,'' said the hussar-upon which Painted crying out, ``O
my mistress, ma bound petite day,'' went off fairly into hysterics, and
filled the house with her screams.
Will with terror, MIr. Sedley knew not how or where to seek for safety.
He rushed from the kitchen back to the sitting-room, and cast an appeal-
ing look at Amelia's door, which Mrs. O'Down had closed and looked in
his face; but he remembered how scornfully the latter had received him,
and after pausing and listening for a brief space at the door, he left it,
and resolved to go into the street, for the first time that day. So, seizing
an candle, he looked about for his gold-laced cap, and found it lying in its
usual place, on a console-table, in the ante-room, placed before s mirror
at which Joy used to coquet, always giving his side-locks a twirl, and his
cap the proper cock over his eye, before he cut forth to make appearance
in public. Such is the force of habit, that even in the midst of his terror
he began mechanically to twiddle with his hair, and arrange the cock of

They will mistake me for a military man, thought he, remembering Isidor's
warning, as to the massacre with which all the defeated British army was
threatened; and staggering back to his bed-chamber, he began wildly pulling
the bell which summoned his valet.
Isidor answered that summons. Joy had sunk in a chair-he had torn
off his neckcloth, and turned down his collars, and was sitting with both
his hands lifted to his throat.
 Couple-moi, Isidor,'' shouted he; '' bite/ Couple-moi ''
Isidor thought for a moment he had gone mad, and that he wished lis
valet to cut his throat.

penny delors''-were of's words,-the coat and cap were at last his
property.
1his gift being made, Joy selected a plain black coat and waistcoat
from his stock, and put on a large white neckeloth, and a plain beer.

you would have fancied he was a lourishing, large parson of the Church

house, and passed into the street.
Although llcgulus had owed that he was the only man of his regiment
or of the allied army, almost, who had escaped being cut to pieces by New, it
appeared that his statement was correct, and that a good number more
of the supposed victims had survived the mussaere. Many scores of
Regular's comrades had found their way back to Brussels, und-all agree-
ing that they had run away-filled the whole town with an idea of the
defeat of the allies. The arrival of the French was expected hourly; the
panic continued, and preparations for flight went on everywhere. No
horses thought Is, in terror. DIe made sailor inquire of scores of
persons, whether they had any to lend or sell, and his heart sank within
him, at the negative answers returned everywhere. Should he take the
journey on foot? Even fear could not render that ponderous body so
active.
Almost all the hotels occupied by the English in 3russels face the
Park, and Joy wandered irresolutely about in this quarter, with crowds
of other people, oppressed and he was by fear and curiosity. Some families
he saw more happy than himself, having discovered a team of horses, and
rattling through the streets in retreat; others again there were whose case
was like his own, and who could not for any brides or cutrcaties proeure
the necessary means of flight. Amongst these would-be fugities, Joy
remarked the Lady Bureaceres and her daughter, who satin theircarriage
in the pre-course of their hotel, all their imperials packed, and the
only drawback to whose flight was the same want of motive power which
kept Joy stationary.
Respect Crawled occupied apartments in this hotel ; and had before this
period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladies of the Bareacres
family. My Lady bBareacres cut Mrs. Crawled on the stairs when they
met by chance; and in all places where the latter's name was men-
tioned, spoke perscvcringly ill of her neighbour. The Countess was
shocked at the familiarity of (general lifts with the side-do-camp's wife.
The Lady Blanche avoided her as if she had been in infectious disease.
Only the Earl himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her, when

known in the hotel that Captain Crawled's horses had been left behind, and
when the panic began, Lady Darecres condesccnded to send her maid to
the Captain's wife with her Ladyship's compliments, an a desire to know
the price of MRs. Crawled's horses. Mrs. Crawled returned a note with her

burgains with ladies' maids.
This curt reply brought the Earl in person to Beck's apartment ; but
he could get no more success than the first ambssador. `` Send a lady's
maid to ne'' Mrs. Crawled cried in great anger; `by didn't any Lady
Bareacres tell me to go and sadly the horses Is it her Ladyship that
wants to escape, or her Ladyship's feet de clalre 2'' And this was all
the answer that the Earl bore back to his Countess.
What will not necessity do The Countess herself actually came to
wait upon Mrs. Crawled on the failure of her second cnvoy. She entreated
her to name her own price; she even offered to invite lUcky to lareacres
HOuse, if the latter would but give her the means of returning to month
residence. Mrs, Crawled sneered at her.
I dont want to be waited on by builifIs in livery,'' she said; 'you
will never get back though most probably-at least, not you and your
diamonds together. The french will have those. he will be here in
two hours, and I shall be half way to Ghent by that time. I would not

wore at the bell.'' Lady Bareaeres treble with rage and terror. IT
lions were sewed into her habit, and secreted in y Lord's parting
and boots. `Woman, the diamonds re at the one's, and I will have
the horses,'' she said. Rebecca laughed in her face. The infuriate Corn-
less went below, and sat in her carriage; her mind, her courier, and her
husband were sent once more through the town, each to look for cattle; and
wo beside those who came last Her Ladyship was resolved on departing
the very instant the horses arrived from any quarter-with her husband
or without him.
llebecca had the pleasure of seeing her Ladyship in the horseless car-
rage, and keeping her eyes fixed upon her, and bewailing, in the loudest
tone of voice, the Countess's perplexities. `Not to be able to get horses!''
she said, `` and to have all those diamonds sewcd in to the carriage cushions
What a prize it will be for the French when they come l-the cringe and
the diamonds I mean; not the lady'' She gave this information to
the landlord, to the servants, to the guests, and the innumerable stragglcrs
about the court-yard. Lady Bareaeres could have shot her from the car-
rage-window.
It was while enjoying the humiliation of her enemy the Rcbeeca caught
sight of Joy, who made towards her directly he perceived her.
That altered, frightened, fat face, told his secret well enough. He
too wanted to fly, and was on the look-out for the means of escape, `'DIe
shall buy my horses,'' thought llebeoe, ` and I'll rise the more.''
Joy walked up to his friend, and put the question for the hundredth
time during the past hour, `` Did she know where horses were to be lad''

Besides, I don't want to desert her,'' cried te brother.  She shan't
e deserted. There is  seat for her in my carriage, and one for you, dear
Mrs. Crawled, if you will come; and if we can get horses-'' sighed he-
I have to to sell,'' the lady said. Joy could have flung himself into
her arms at the news. `' Get the carriage, Vision,'' he cried; ` we 've
found them-we have found them.''
My horses never were in harness,'' added the lady. ``Bulfinuch would
kick the carriage to pieces, if you put him in the traces.''
But he is quiet to ride?'' asked the ceiling.
As quiet as a lamb, and as fast as a hare,'' answered Receive.
Do you think he is up to my weight?'' Joy said. HIe was already
on his back, in imagination, without ever so much as a thought for poor
Amelia. What person who led a horse-speculation could resist such a
temptation
In reply, Rebecea asked him to come into her room, whither he followed
her quite breathless to conclude the bargain. Joy seldom spent a half
hour in his life which cost him so much money. Rebecca measuring the
value of the goods which she had for sale by Joy's eagerness to purchase,
as well as by the scarcity of the article, put upon her horses a price so
prodigious as to make even the civility draw back.  She would sell
both or neither,'' she said, resolutely. Newson had ordered her not to
part with the for n price less than that which she stupefied. Lord
lareaceres below would give her the same money-and with all her love
and regard for the Hedley family, er dear Mr. Joseph must conceive that
poor people must live-nobody, in a word, could be more affectionate, but
more firm about the matter of business.
Joy ended by agreeing, as might be supposed of him. The sum he had
to give her was so large that he was obliged to ask for time; so large as
to be a little fortune to Rebecca, who rapidly cnleulnted that with this
sum, and the sole of the residue of Rawson's effects, and her pension as a
widow should he fell, she would now be absolutely independent of the
world, and might look her weeds steadily in the face.
Once or twice in the day she certainly hal herself thought about flying.
But her reason gave her better counsel. ``Suppose the French do come,''
thought Beck, 'what can they do to a poor officer's widow2 Ball the
times of sacks and sieges arc over. We shall be let to go hoe quietly,
or I may live pleasantly broad with a snug little income.''
Meanwhile Joy and Isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly-
purchased cattle. Joy bade his man saddle the horses at once. He
would ride away that very night, that very hour. And he left the valet
busy in getting the horses ready, and went homewards himself to prepare
for his departure. It must be secret. he would go to his chamber by
the back entrance. He did not care to face Mrs, O'Down and Amelia,
and own to them that he was about to run.
By the time Joe's bargain with Rebeeca was completed, and his horses
had been visited and examined, it was almost morning once more. But

though midnight was long passed, there was no rest for the city ; the
people were up, the lights in the houses flame, crowds were still about
the doors, and the streets were busy. Rumours of various natures went
still from mouth to mouth: one report averred that the Prussians had been
utterly defented; another that it was the English who had been attacked
and conquered; a third that the latter had held their ground. This
last rumour gradually got strength. No Frenchmen had made their
appearance. Stragglers had come in from the ary bringing reports more
and more favourable: nt last an aside-le-camp actually reached Brussels
with despatches for the Commandant of the place, who placarded presently
through the town an official announcement of the success of the allies at
(uatre Brass, and the entire repulse of the French under Nay after a six
hours' battle. The side-de-cnmp must have arrived sometime while Joy
and Rebecca were making their bargain together, or the latter was suspect-
ing his purchase. When ho reached his own hotel, he found a score of its
numerous inhabitants on the threshold discoursing of the news; there was
no doubt as to its truth. And he went up to communicate it to the ladies
under his large. lIe did not think it was necessary to tell them how he
had intended to take leave of them, how he had bought horses, and what
price he had paid for them.
But success or defeat was a minor matter to them, who had only thought
for the safety of those they loved. Amelia, at the news of the victory,
become still more agitated even the before. She was for going that to-
end to the army. She besought her brother with tears to conduct her
thither. PIer doubts and terrors reached their paroxysm; and the poor
girl, who for many hours had been plunged into stupor, raved and ran
hither and thither in hysteric insanity-a piteous sight. No man writhing
in pain on the hard-fought field fifteen miles of, where lay, after their
struggles, so many of the brave-no man suffered more keenly than this
poor harmless victim of the war. Joy could not bear the sight of her pain.
DIe left his sister in the charge of her stouter female companion, and
descended once more to the threshold of the hotel, where everybody still
lingered, and talked, and waited for more news.
It grew to be broad light as they stood here, and fresh news began
to arrive from the war, brought by men who had been actors in the scene.
Waggons and long country carts laden with wounded one rolling into tlc
town; ghastly grows me from within them, and haggard faces looked up
sadly from out of the straw. Joy Sedley was looking at one of these
carriages with a painful curiosity-the moans of the people within were
frightful-the wearied horses could hardly pull the cart. Stop stop a
feeble voice cried from the straw, and the carriage stopped opposite MIr.

balcony, with a pallid face and loose flowing had. It was not George,
however, but it was the next best thing: it was news of him.
It was poor Tom Stubble, who had marched out of Brussels so gallantly
twenty-four hours before, bearing the colours of the regiment, which he
had defended very gallantly upon the field. A French lancer hal secured
the young ensign in the leg, who fell, still bravely holding to his flag. At

the conclusion of the engagement, a place had been found for the poor boy
in a cart, and he had been brought back to rustle.
eMIr. Sedley, Mr. SedleyI'' heard the hoy faint'y, and Joy came up
almost frightened at the appeal. DIe had not at first distinguished who
it was that called him.
Little Tom trouble held out his lot and feeble hand. I'm to be
taken in here,'' he said.  Scorned-and-and Doing said I was; and
you are to give the man two Napoleons : my mother will pay you.'' This
young fellow's thoughts, during the long feverish hours passed in the
cart, had been wandering to his father's parsonnge which he had quitted
only a few months before, and he and sometimes forgotten lis pain in
that delirium.
The hotel was large, and the people kind, and all the inmates of the
cart were taken in and placed on various couches. he young ensign
was convent up-stairs to Borne's quarters. Amelia and the MIajor's
wife had rushed down to him, when the latter had recognized him from the
bnl]cony. you may fancy the feelings of these women when they are
told that the day was over, and both their husbands were safe; in what
mute rapture Amelia fell on her good friend's neck, and embraced her;
in what a grateful passion of prayers she fell on her knees, and thanked
the Power which had saved her husband.
Our young lady, in her fevered and nervous condition, could have had
no one snlutary medicine prescribed for her by any physician tan that
which chance put in her way. She and Mrs. O'Down watched incessantly
by the wounded lad, whose pains were very severe, and in the duty thus
forced upon her, Amelia had not time to brood over her personal anxieties,
or to give herself up to her own ears and forebodings after her wont.
The young patient told in his simple fashion the events of the day, and
the nations of our friends of the gallant -th. They had suffered
severely. They had lost very many oflicers and men. The Ivor's
horse had been shot under him as the regiment charged, and they all
thought that O'Down was gone, and the Doing lad got lis majority,
until on their return from the charge to their old ground, the Moor
was discovered seated on yramus's carcase, refreshing himself from a
case-battle. It was Captain Osborue that cut down the green longer
with and spared the cnsign. Amelian turned so pale at the notion, that
MIss. O'Down stopped the young ensign in this story. And it was Cap-
pain Doing who at the end of the day, though wounded himself, took up
the Inad in his arms and carried him to the surgeon, and thence to the cart
which was to bring him back to I3russels. And it was he who promise
the river two louis if he would make his way to Mr. Sedley's hotel in
1the city; and tell Mrs. Captain Borne that the action was over, and that
her husband was hurt and well.
 Indeed, but he has a good heart that William Doing,'' MRs. O'God
said, '`though he is always laughing at me.'
young Stubble vowed there was not such another officer in the army,
and never ceased his praises of the senior captain, his modesty, his kind-
less, and his admirable coolness in the field. To these parts of the
conversation, hamlin lent a very distracted attention: it was only when

George was spoken of that she listened, and when he was not mentioned,
she thought about him.
In tending her patient, and in thinking of the wonderful scenes of the
day before, her second day passed away not too slowly with blind. here
was only one man in the army for her: and as long as he was well, it must
be only that its movements interested her little. All the reports which
Joy brought from the streets full very vaguely on her ears; though they
were sufficient to give that timorous gentleman, and many other people
then in Brussels, very disquiet. he oF'reach had been repulsed certainly,
but it was after a severe and doubtful struggle, and with only a division of
the French army. The Emperor, with the main only, was away at Light,
where he had utterly annihilated the Prussians, and was now fre to bring
his whole force to bear upon the allies. 1he Duke of Wellington was
retreating upon the capital, and a great battle must be fought under its
walls probably, of which the chances were more than doubtful. The Duke
of Wellington had but twenty thousand BRitish troops on whom he could
rely, for the Germans were raw militia, the Begins disaffected; and with
this handful his Grace had to resist a hundred and fifty thousand men that
had broken into Belgium under Nanoleon. Under Nnpoleon 1 What warrior
was there, however famous and skilful, that could fight at old with him
Joy thought of all these things, and trembled. So did all the rest of
Brussels-where people felt that the felt of the day before was but the
prelude to the greater combat which was imminent. One of the armies
opposed to the Emperor was scattered to the winds already. The few
English that could be brought to resist him would perish at their posts,
and the conqueror would pass over their bodies into the city. Woe be to
those whom he found there Addresses were prepared, public function-
cries assembled and debntol secretly, apartments were got ready, and
tricooloured banners and triumphal emblems manufactured, to welcome the
arrival of His Majesty the Emperor and King.
The emigration still continued, and wherever families could find means
of departure, they fled. When Joy, on the afternoon of the 17th of June,
went to Rebeeca's hotel, he found that the great DDareacres' carriage had at
length rolled away from the port-covered. The Earl had procurecd a pair
of horses somehow, in spite of Mrs. Crawled, and was rolling on the road
to Ghent. Louis the Desired, was getting ready his portmanteau in that
city, too. It seemed as if Misfortune was never tired of worrying into
motion that unwieldy exile.
Joy felt that the delay of yesterday had been only a rcspite, and that his
dearly bought horses must of a surely le put into requisition. His
agonies were very severe all this day. as long as there was an English
army between Brussels and Napoleon, there was no need of immediate
flight; but he had his horses brought from their distant stables, to the
stables in the court-yard of the hotel where he lived; so that try might
be under his own eyes, and beyond the risk of violent abuction. Isidor
watched the stable-door constantly, and had the horses saddled, to be ready
for the start. He longed intensely for that oven.
After the reception of the previous day, Reach did not care to come
near her der Amelia. She clipped the bouquet which George had brought

her, and gave fresh went to the flowers, and read her the letter which
he had sent her.  Poor wretch,'' she said, twirling round the little bit
of paper in her fingers, ``how I could crush her with this-and it is for
a thing like this that she must break her heart forsooth-for a man who
is stupid-a coxcomb-and who does not care for her. My poor good
Rawlon is worth ten of this creature.'' And then she fell to thinking
what she should do if-if anything happened to poor good Rawdon, and
what a great piece of luck it was that he had left his horses behind.
In the course of this day too, Mrs. Crawled, who saw not without anger
the Bareacrcs party drive off, becthought her of the precaution which the
countess had taken, and did a little needlewvork for own advantage; she
started away the major part of her triukets, bills, and bank-notes about
her person, and so prepared, was ready for any vent-to fly if she
thought fit, or to stay and welcome the conqueror, were he Englishmau or
Frenchmnan. And I am not sure that she did not drew that night of
becoming a duchess and Madame la Marchesa, while Rawdon wrapped in
his cloak, and making his bivouac under the rain at Mount Saint John,
was thinking, with all the force of his heart, about the little wife whom he
had left behind him.
The next day was  Sunday. And MRs. Moor O'God had the satin-
action of seeing both her patients refreshcd in health and spirits by some
rest which they had taken during the night. She herself had slept on a
great chair in Amelia's room, ready to wait upon her poor friend or
the ensign, should either need her nursing. WHen morning came, this
robust woman went back to the house where she and her MIajor had their
billet; and here performed n elaborate and splendid toilette, bcfitting the
day. And it is very possible that whilst alone in that chamber, which
her husband had inhabited, and where his cup still lay on the pillow, and
his cane stood in the corner, one prayer at least was sent up to Heaven
for the welfare of the brave soldier, Michael O'Down.
WHen she returned she brought her prayer-book with her, and her
uncle the Dead's famous book of sermons, out of which she never failed to
rend every Sabbath: not understanding all, happy, not pronouncing many
of the words aright, which were long and abstruse-for the Dead was a
learned man, and loved long Latin words-but with great gravity, vast
emphasis, and with tolerable correctness in the main. How often has my
Sick listened to these serious, she thought, and me reading in the cabin
of a calm. She proposed to reach this exercise on the present day, with
Amelia and the wounded ensign for a congregation. The same service
was read on that day in twenty thousand churches at the same hour; and
millions of British man and women, on their knees, implored protection of
the Father of all.
They did not hear the noise which disturbed our little congregation at
Brussels. Much louder than that which had interrupted them two day
previously, as Mrs. O'Down was reading the service in her best voice, the
cannon of Waterloo began to roar.
When Joy heard that dreadful sound, he made up his mind that he
would bear this perpetual recurrence of terrors no longer, and would fly at

paused in their prayers, and further interrupted them by a passionate
appeal to Amelia.
I can't stand it any more, Emmy,'' he said ; `I won't stand it; and
you must come with me. I have bought a horse for you-never mind
it what price-and you must dress and come with me, and ride belinda
Isidor.''
God forgive me, Mr. Sedley, but you are no better than a coward,''
Mrs. O'Down said, laying down the book.
`:I say come, Amelin,'' the civility went on; ``never mind what she
says; why are we to stop here and be butchered by the Frenchmen ?''
 You forget the -th, my boy,'' said the little Stubble, the wounded
hero, From his bed-``and-and you won't leave me, will you, Mrs.
O'Down'
No, y der fellow,'' said she, going up and kissing the boy. No
had shall come to you while I stand by.  I don't judge till I get the
world from Sick. A pretty figure I'd be, wouldn't I, stuck belinda that
cap on a million ''
This age made the young patient to burst out laughing in his bed,
and even made Amelia smile.  I don't ask her,'' Joy shouted out-i
don't ask that-that Irishwomn, but you, Amelia; once for all, will you
come  
Without my husband, Joseph?'' Amelia said with a look of wonder,
and gave her hand to the Mayor's wife. Joy's patience was exshaustecl.
 Good bye, then,'' he said, shaking his fist in a rage, and slamning the
door by which he retreated. And this time he really gave lis order for
nearly: and mounted in the court-yard. Mrs. O'Down heard th clattcr-
ing hoofs of the horses as they issued from the gate; and looking on, are
many scornful remarks on poor Joseph as he rode down the street with
Silver after him in the laced cup. The horses, which had not been cxercised
for some days, were lively, and sprang about the street. Job, a clumsy
and timid foreman, did not look to advantage in the saddle. ` Look at
hi, Aelia, dear, driving into the parlour window. Such n bull in n
china-shop I never saw.'' And presently the pair of riders disappeared
at a canter down the street walking in the direction of the Ghent road.
MRs. O'Down pursuing them with a fire of sarcasm so long as they were
in sight.
All that day from morning until past sunset, the cannon never ceased to
roar. It was dark when the cannonading stopped all of a sudden.
All of us have read of what occurred during that interval. The tale is
in every Englishman's mouth; and you and I, who were children when
the great battle was won and lost, are never tired of hearing and recount-
in the history of that famous action. Its remembncc ankles still in
the bosom of millions of the countries of those brave men who lost the
day. They want for an opportunity of preventing that humiliation; and if
a contest, ending in a victory on their part, should ensue, eating them in
their turn, and leaving its cursed legacy of hatred and rage behind to us,
there is no end to the so-culled glory and shame, and to the alternations
of successful and unsuccessful murder, in which two high-spirited nations
might engage. Centuries hence, we Frenchmen and knglishmen might be

boasting and killing each other still, carrying out bravely the Devil's code
of honour.
All our friends took their share nd fought like men in the great field.
All day long, whilst the women were praying ten miles away, the lines
of the dauntless English infantry were receiving and rebelling the furious
charges of the French horsemen. Guns which were heard nt Brush-
self were laughing up their ranks, and comrades falling, and the
resolute survivors closing in. Towards evening, the attack of the French,
repeated and resisted so bravely, slackened in its fury. They lad other
foes besides the British to engage, or were preparing for a final onset.
t came at last : the columns of the Imperial Guard marched up the hill
of Saint Jean, at length and at once to sweep the English from the
light which they had maintainedl all day, and spite of all: unscarred by
the thunder of the artillery, which hurled death from the English line-the
dark rolling column pressed on and up the hill. It seemed almost to
crest the eminence, when it began to wave and falter. Then it stopped,
still facing the shot. Then at last the English troops rushed from the
post from which no enemy had been able to dislodge them, and the Guard
turned and fled.
No more ring was heard at Brussels-the pursuit rolled miles away.
The darkness came down on the field and city, and Amelia was prying
for George, who was lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through his
heart.

to take the fortifications on the
frontiers of France, previous to an
occupation of that country,-that
there are a number of persons living
peaceably in England who have to
do with the history at present in
hand, and must come in for their
share of the chronicle. During the
time of these battles and dangers,
old Miss Crawled was living at
Brainton, very moderately moved
by the great events that were going
on. The great events rendered the
newspapers rather interesting, to be sure, and Brings read out the Gazette,
in which Rawdon Crawled's gallautry was mentioned with honour, and his
promotion to be Lieutenant-Colonel was presently recorded.
 What a pity that young man has taken such in irretrievble step in the
world,'' his aunt said; '' with his rank and distinction i might have married

in a hurry to go, Miss Brings, although you may he in a hurry to be
rid of me; and instead of that, he is a doomed pauper, with a dancing-
 girl for a wife.''
 Will my dear Miss Crawled not cast an eye of compassion upon
the heroic soldier, whose name is inscribed in the annals of his country's
glory 2'' said Miss Brings, who was greatly excited by the Waterloo
proceedings, and loved speaking romantically when there was an occasion.

 Brings, you are a fool,'' said Miss Crawled : t Colonel Crawled has

she was no better, Brings; no, she was just what you are-only younger,
and a great deal prettier and cleverer. Were you an accomplice of that

abandoned wretch, I wonder, of whose vile arts he became a victim, and
of whom you used to be such an admirer Is, I daresay you were an
nccoplice. But you will find yourself disappointed in my will, I can
tell you: and you will have the goodness to write to Mr. Way, and say
that I desire to see him immediately.'' Miss Crawled was now in the
habit of writing to Mr. Way her solicitor almost every day in the week,
for her arrangements respecting her property were all revoked, and her
perplexity was great as to the future disposition of her money.
The spinster had, however, rallicd considerably; as was proved by the
increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasms upon Miss Brings, all
which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness, with cowardice,
with a resignation that was half generous, and half hypocritical-with the
slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and station
are compelled to show. Who has not seen how women fully women:
WHat tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily-repeated
shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the
tyrant of their sex Poor victims But we are starting from our
proposition, which is, that MIss Crawled was always particularly annoy-
ing and savage when she was rullying from illness-as they say wounds
single most when they are about to heal.
WHile thus approaching, as all hoped, to convlescence, Miss Brings
was the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid; yet Miss
Crawled's relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinsman, and by
a number of tokens, presents, and kind affectionate messages, strove to
keep themselves alive in her recollection.
In the first place, let us mention her nephew, Rawdon Crawled. A
few weeks after the famous fight of Watlerloo, and after the Gazette had
made known to her the promotion and gullantry of that distinguished
fficer, the Dicppe packet brought over to Miss Crawled at Brighton, a
box containing presents, and a dutiful letter, from the Colonel her nephew.
In the box were a pair of French epaulets, a Cross of the LEgion of
Honour, and the hill of a sword-rclics from the field of battle: and the
letter described with a good deal of humour low the latter belonged to a
commanding-offieer of the Guard, who having sworn that ` the Guard
lied, but never surreudered,'' was taken prisoner the next minute by a
private soldier, who broke the Frenchman's sword with the butt of his
musket, when Rawdon made himself master of the shattered weapon.
As for the cross d epaulets, they came from a Colonel of French
rivalry, who had fallen under the side-de-camp's arm in the battle: and
Rawson Crawled did not know what better to do with the spoils than
to send them to his kindest and most affectionate old friend. Should
he continue to write to her from Paris, whither the army was marehing 
It might be able to give her interesting news from that capital, and
of some of Miss Crawled's old friends of the emigration, to whom she
had shown so much kindness during their distress.
The spinster caused Brings to write back to the Colonel a gracious
and complimentury letter, encouraging him to continue his correspondence.
HIs first letter was so excessively lively and amusing that she should look
with pleasure for its suceessors.- Of course I know,'' she explained to
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
291
Miss Brings, '` that Rawdon could not write such a good letter any more
than you could, my poor Brings, and that it is that clear little wretch ol
na became, who dictates every word to him; but that is no reason why
my nephew should not amuse me; and so I wish to let him understand
that I am in high good-humour.''
I wonder whether she knew that it was not only valley who wrote the
letters, but that Mrs. Newson actually took and sent home the prophets-
which she bought for a few franes, from one of the innumerable pedlars,
who immediately began to deal in relics of the war. The novelist, who
knows everything, knows this also. Be this, however, is it may, Miss
Crawled's gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends Shadow
and his lady, who hoped for the best from their aunt's evidently pacified
humour: and they took care to entertain her with many delightful
letters from Paris, whither, is Pardon said, they had the good luck to go
in the track of the conquering army.
To the rector's lady, who went off to tend her husband's broken
collar-bone at the Rectory at queen's Crawled, the spinster's cousin-
nations were by no means so gracious. Mrs. But, that brisk, manage-
ing, lively, imperious woman, had committed the most fatal of all errors
with regard to her sister-in-law. She hnl not crely oppressed her and
her household-she had bored Miss Crawled : and if poor Miss Brings
had been a woman of any spirit, she might have been made happy by
the commission which her principal give her, to write a letter to Mrs.
But Cruelty, saying that Miss Crawled's health was partly improved
since Mrs. use had left her, and begging the letter on no account to it
herself to trouble, or quit her family for Miss Crawled's sake. This
triumph over a lady who had been very haughty and cruel in her that-
vigour to Miss Brings, would have rejoiced most women; but the truth
is, Brings was a woman of no spirit at all, and the moment her enemy
was discomfited she began to feel compassion in her favour.
eeHIow silly I was,'' Mrs. lBute thought, and with reason, ``ever to
Hint that I was coming, as I did, in that foolish letter when we sent Miss

nine bRings, and that harry of a fine de elsmere. Oh. But, But,
why did you break your collar-bone?''
Why, indeed We have seen how Mrs. But, having the game in her
hands, hal really played her cards too well. She had ruled over Miss
Crawled's household utterly and completely, to be utterly and completely
routed when n favouruable opportunity for rebellion came. She and her
household, however, considered that she had been the victim of horrible
selfishness and treason, and that her saecrifices in Miss Crawled's hehalf
had met with the most savage ingratitude. Rawson's promotion, and the
honourable mention made of his name in the Gazette, filled this good
Christian lady also with alarm. Would his aunt relent towards him now
that he was a Colonel and a C..P and would that odious Rebeccs once
more get into favour2 The rector's wife wrote a sermon for her husband

syllable of it. He had Pitt Crawled for one of his auditors-Pitt, who had
come with his two half-sisters, to church, which the old Baronet could now
by now means be brought to frequent.
Since the departure of Beck Sharp, that old wretch had given himself
up entirely to his bad courses, to the great scandal of the county and the
mute horror of his son. The ribbons in Miss Horrocks's cap became more
splendid than ever. The polite families fled the hall and its owner in
terror. Sir Pitt went about tippling at his tenants' houses; and drank
rum-and-water with the farmers at Mudbury and the neighbouring places
on market-days. He drove the family coach-and-four to Southampton
with Miss Horrocks inside: and the county people expected, every week,
as his son did in speechless agony, that his manage with her would be
announced in the provincial paper. It was indeed a rude burden for Mr.
Crawled to bear. His eloquence was palsied at the visionary meetings,
and other religious assemblies in the neighbourhood, where he had been in
the habit of presiding, and of speaking for hours; for he felt, when he
rose, that the audience said, ``That is the son of the old reprobate Sir
Pitt, who is very likely drinking at the public-house at this very moment.''
And once when he was speaking of the benighted condition of the king of
Timbuctoo, and the number of his wives who were likewise in darkness,
some tipsy miscrennt from the crowd asked,  How many is there at
queen's Crawled, young quaretoesP'' to the surprise of the platform,
and the ruin of Mr. Pitt's speech. Me the two daughters of the house
of queen's Crawled would have been allowed to run utterly wild (for Sin
Pitt swore that no governess should ever enter into his doors again), had
not Mr. Crawled, by threatening the old gentleman, forced the latter to
send them to school.
MEanwhile, as we have said, whatever individual differences there might
be between them all, Miss Crawled's dear nephew and niece were
unnnimous in loving her and sending her tokens of affection. Thus Mrs.
But sent guinea-fowls, and some remnrknably fine cauliflowers, and a pretty
purse or pincushion worked by her darling girls, who begged to keep a
little place in the recollection of their dear aunt, while Mr. Pitt sent
peaclecs and grapes and evening from the Hall. The Southampton coach
used to carry these tokens of affection to Miss Crawled at Brighton : it
used sometimes to convey Mr. Pitt thither too : for his differences with Sir
Pitt cause Mr. Called to absent himself a good deal from home now:
and besides, he had an attraction at Brighten in the person of the Lady
Jane Sheepshanks whose engagement to Mr. Crawled has been formerly
mentioned in this history. Her Ladyship and her sisters lived at Brighton
with their mamma, the Countess Southdown, that strong-minded woman
so favourable known in the serious world.
A few words ought to be said regarding her Ladyship and her noble
family, who are bound by ties of present and future relationship to the
house of Crawled. Respecting the chief of the Southdown family, Clement
William, fourth Earl of Southdown, little need be told, except that his
Lordship came into Parliament (as Lord WVolsey), under the auspices of
M. WilbUerforce, and for a time was a credit to is political sponsor, and
decidedly a serious young man. But words cannot describe the feelings

of his admirable mother, when she learned, very shortly after her noble
husband's demise, that her son was a member of several worldly clubs, had
lost largely at play at Waters and the Cool TRee; that he had raised
money on post-bits, and encumbered the family estate; that he drove
four-in-hand, and patronized the ring; and that he actually had an opera-
box, where he entertained the most dangerous bachelor company. His
name was only mentioned with groans in the widower's circle.
The Lady Emily was her brother's senior by many years; and took
considerable rank in the serious world as author of some of the delightful
traets before mentioned, and of many hymns and spiritual pieces. A
mature spinster, and having but faint ideas of marriage, her love for the
blacks occupied almost all her feelings. It is to her, I believe, we owe
that beautiful poem,-
 Lead us to come sunny pale,
Yonder in the western deep;
Where the skies for ever smile,
And the blacks for ever weep,'' &a
She had correspondence with clerical gentlemen in most of our
East and West India possessions; and was secretly attached to
the Reverend Silas Hornblower, who was tattooed in the South See
Islands.
As for the Lady Jane, on whom, as it has been said, Mr. Pitt
Crawled's affection had been placed, she was gentle, blushing, silent,
and timid. In spite of his falling away, she wept for her brother, and was
quite ashamed of loving him still. Even yet she used to send him little
hurried smuggled notes, and pot them in the post in private. The one
dreadful secret which weighed upon her life was, that she and the old
housekeeper had been to pay Southdown a furtive visit at his chambers in
the Brandy; and found him-TO the naughty dear abandoned wretch
smoking a cigar with a bottle of Curacoa before him. She admired her
sister, she adored her mother, she thought Mr. Crawled the most delight-
ful and accomplished of men, after Southdown, that fallen angel: and her
mamma and sister, who were ladies of the most superior sort, managed
everything for her, and regarded her with that amiable pity, of which
your really superior woman always has such a share to give way. Her
mamma ordered her dresses, her books, her bonnets, and her ideas for her.
She was made to take pony-riding, or piano-exercise, or any other sort of
bodily medicament, according as my lady Southdown saw meet; and her
ladyship would have kept her daughter in pinafores up to her present age
of six-and-twenty, but that they were thrown off when Lady Jane was
presented to been Charlotte.
When these ladies first came to their house at Brighton, it was to them
alone that Mr. Crawled paid his personal visits, contenting himself by leaving
a card at his aunt's house, and making a modest inquiry of Mr, Bowls or his
assistant footman, with respect to the health of the inlid. When he met
Miss Brings coming home from the library with a cargo of novels under
her arm, Mr. Crawled blushed in a manner quite unusual to him, as he
stepped forward and shook Miss Crawled's companion by the hand. He

introduced Miss Brings to the lady with whom he happened to be walking,
the Lady Jane Sheepshanks, saying, ''Lady Jane, permit me to introduce
to you my aunt's kindest friend and most affectionate companion, Miss
Brings, whom you know under another title, as authoress of the delightful
`Lyrics of the Heart,' of which you are so fond.'' Lady Janeblushed too
as she held out a kind little hand to Miss Brings, and said something very
civil and incoherent about mamma, and proposing to call on Miss Crawled,
and being glad to be made known to the friends and relatives of Mr.
Crawled; and with soft dove-like eyes saluted Miss bRings as they
separated, while Pitt Crawled treated her to a profound curtly bow, such

which he remembered to have seen at queen's Crawled, with a dedication
from the hostess to his father's late wife; and he brought the volume with
him to frighten, reading it in the Southampton coach, and marking it
with his own pencil, before he presented it to the gentle Lady June.
It was he, too, who laid before Lady Southdown the great advantageswhich
might occur from an intimacy between her family and Miss Cruelty,--
advantages oh worldly and spiritual, he said: for Miss Crawled was now
quite lone; the monstrous dissipation and alliance of his brother Rawdon,
had estrangel her affections from that rcprobute young man; the greedy
tyranny and avarice of Mrs. But Crawled had caused the old lady to
revolt against the exorbitant pretensions of the part of the family; and
though he himself had hell off all his life from cultivating Miss Crawled's
friendship, with perhaps an improper pride, he thought now that every
becoming means should be taken, both to see her soul from perdition, and
to secure lcr fortune to himself as the head of the house of Crawled.
The strong-minded Lady Southdown quite agreed in both proposals of
her son-in-law, and was for converting Miss Crawled of hand. At her
own home, both at Soutludown and at Trottermore Cnstle, this tall and
awful missionary of the truth rode about the country in her barouche with
outriders, launched packets of tracts among the cottagers and tennnts, and
would order After Ones to be converted, as she would order Goody STicks
to take a James's powder, without appeal, resistance, or benefit of clergy.
My Lord Southdown, her late husband, an epileptic and simple-minded
nobleman, was in the habit of approving of everything which his Matilda
lid and thought. So that whatever changes her own belief might undergo
(and it aeeomolated itself to a prodigious variety of opinion, taken from
all sorts of doctors among the Dissenters) she had not the least scruple in
ordering all her tenants and inferiors to follow and believe after her. Thus
whether she received the Reverend Saunders CeNtre the Scotch
living; or the lleverend Luke Waters the mild Wesleyan; or the Reverend
(lies Jowls the illuminated Cobbler who rushed himself Reverend as
npoleon drowned himself Emperor-the household, children, tenantry
of my Lady Southdown were expected to go down on their knees with
her Ladyship, and say Amen to the prayers of either Doctor. During these
exercises old Southdown, on account of his invalid condition, was allowed
to sit in his own room, and ave knees and the paper read to him. Lady
Jane was the old Earl's favourite daughter, and tended him and loved him
sincerely: as for Lady Emily, the authoress of the  Washerwoman of
Finches Common,'' her enunciation of future punishments (at this period,
for her opinions modified afterwards) were so awful that they used to
frighten the timid old gentleman her father, and the physicians declared
his fits always occurred after one of her Ladyship's sermons.
I will certainly call,'' said Lady Southdown then, in reply to th
exhortation of her daughter's present, Mr. Pitt Crawled-' Who is
Miss Crawled's medical man''
Mr. Crawled mentioned the name of Mr. Corner.

listened to him; but alas it was too late. His death was delightful,
however; and his change was only for the better: Creamer, my dear Pitt,

Pitt expressed his perfect acquiescence. He too had been carried along
by the energy of his noble kinsman, and future mother-in-law. He
had been made to accept Saunders CeNtre, Luke Waters, Gives Jowls,
Power's Pills, Rodger's Pills, Pokey's Elixir, every one of her Ladyship's
remedies spiritual or temporary. He never left her house without carrying
respectfully away with him piles of her quick theology and medicine. O

she cannot conince by argument, bursts into tears, and the recusant finds
himself, at the end of the contest, taking down the bolts, and saying,

 And as for her spiritual state,'' continued the Lady, '` that of course
must be looked to immediately; with Creamer about her, she may go off

addition I will send the Reverend Mr. Irons to her instantly. Jane, write

Emily.  It is as well to begin soothingly at first.''
`Stop, my dear ladies,'' soil Pitt the diplomatist,  With every deference
to the opinion of my beloved and respected Lady Southdown, I think it
would be quite unavoidable to commence so early upon serious topics with
Miss Crawled. Remember her delicate condition, and how little, how very
little accustomed she has hitherto been to considerations connected with
her immortal welfare,''
`Can we then begin too early, Pitt%'' said Lady Emily, rising with six
little books already in her hand.
 If you begin abruptly, you will frighten her altogether. I know my
aunt's worldly nature so well as to be sure that any abrupt attempt at
conversion will be the very worst means that can be employed for the
welfare of that unfortunate lady. You will only frighten and annoy her.
She will very likely fling the books away, and refuse all acquaintance with
the givers.''
You are as worldly as MIss Crawled, Pitt,'' said Lady Emily, tossing
out of the room, her books in her hand.
`And I need not tell you, my dear LAdy Southdown,'' Pitt continued,
in a low voice, and without heeding the interruption, `` how fall a little

and delicate condition: I know that she has destroyed the will which was
made in my brother's (Colonel Crawled's) favour: it is by soothing that
wounded spirit that we must lead it into the right path, and not by frighten-
in it; and so I think you will agree with me that-that''-
 Of course, of course,'' Lady Southdown remarked. ``Jane, my love,
you need not send that note to Mr. Irons. If her health is such that dis-
cushions fatigue her, we will wait her amusement. I will call upon Miss
Crawled to-morrow,''
``And if I might suggest, my sweet lady,'' Pitt said in a bland tone,
`it would be as well not to take our precious Emily, who is too death-
siastic; but rather that you should be accompanied by our sweet and dear
Lady Anne.''
``Most certainly, Emily would ruin everything,'' Lady Southdown said;
and this time agreed to forego her usual practice, which was, as we have
said, before she bore down personally upon any individual whom she pro-
posed to subjugate, to fire in a quantity of tracts upon the menaced party;
(as a charge of the French was always preceded by n furious cannonale).
Lady Soutldown, we say, for the sake of the invalid's health, or for the
sake of her soul's ultimate welfare, or for the sake of her money, agreed to
temporise.
The next day the great Southdown female family carriage, with the
Earl's content and the lozenge (upon which the three lambs trotting
ardent upon the field art of the Southdowns, were quartered with table
on a bend or, three snuff-mules rules, the cognizance of the house of
Inside), drove up in state to Miss Crawled's door, and the tall serious foot-
man handed in to Mr. Bowls her Ladyship's cards for Miss Crawled, and
one likewise for Miss Brings. By way of compromise, Lady Emily sent in
a packet in the evening for the latter lady, containing copies of the
: Washerwoman,'' and other mild and favourite tracts for Miss B.'s own
perusal; and a few for the servants' hall, viz. : `'Crumbs from the Paltry;''
The Frying Pan and the Fire,'' and  The Livery of Sin,'' of a much

Miss Hriggs, who was enabled
to speak a good word for the
latter, after the cards of the
Southdown family had been pre-
seated to Miss Crawled. A
Countess's card left personally
too for her, Brings, was not a
little pleasing to the poor friend-
less companion.  WHat could
LalySouthdownmean by leaving
a card upon you, I wonder, Miss Brings ?'' said the republican Miss
Crawled ; upon which the companion meekly said ``that she hoped
there could be no harm in a lady of run taking notice of a poor
gentlewoman,'' and she put away this card in her work-box amongst her
most cherished personal treasures. Furthermore, Miss Brings explained
how she had met Mr. Crawled walking with his cousin and long-affianeed
bride the day before: and she told how kind and gentle-looking the lady
was, and what a plain, not to say common, dress she had, all the articles
of which, from the bonnet down to the boots, she described and estimate
with female accuracy.
Miss Crawled allowed Brings to prattle on without interrupting her to
much. As she got well, she was pining for society. Mr. Creamer, her
medical man, would not hear of her returning to her old haunts and display-
lion in London. The old spinster was too glad to find any companionship
at Brainton, and not only were the cards acknowledged the very next day,
but it Crawled was graciously invited to come and see his aunt. He
came, bringing with him Lady Southdown and her daughter. The danger
did not say a word about the state of Miss Crawled's soul; but talked
with much discretion about the weather: about the way and the downfallen
of the monster Bonnparte: and above all, about doctors, quacks, and the
particular merits of Dr. Powers, whom she then patronised.
During their interview Pitt Crawled made a great stroke, and one which
showed that, had his diplomacy career not been blighted by early neglect,
he might have risen to a high rank in his profession. When the Countess

was in those days, and showed that he was a monster stained with eery

conceivable crime, a coward and a tyrant not fit to live, one whose fall was
predicted, &c., Pitt Crawled suddenly took up the cudgels in favour of the
man of Destiny. le described the First Consul as he saw him at Paris
at the Peace of Amiens; when he, Pitt Crawled, had the gratification of
making the acquaintance of the great and good Mr. Fox, a statesan
whom, however much he might differ with him, it was impossible not to
admire fervently-a statesman who had always had the highest opinion
of the eMperor Napoleon. And he spoke in terms of the strongest
indignation of the fruitless conduct of the allies towards this dethroned
monarch, who, after giving himself generously up to their mercy, as
consigned to an ignoble and cruel banishment, while a bigotted paris
rabble was tyrannising over France in his stead.
This orthodox horror of Promise superstition saved Pitt Crawled in Lady
Southdown's opinion, whilst his admiration for ox and Napoleon raised
him immeasurably in Miss Crawled's eyes. Her friendship with that
defence British statesmnn was mentioned when we first introduced her in
this history. A true Whig, Miss Crawled had been in opposition all
through the war, and though, to be sure, the downfall of the Emperor did
not very much agitated the old lady, or his ill-treatment tell to shorten
her life or natural rest, yet Pitt spoke to her heart when he lauded both
her idols; and by that single speech made immense progress in her favour.
`And what do you think, my dear'' Miss Crawled said to the young
lady, for whom she had taken a liking at first sight, as she always lid for
pretty and modest young people; though it must be owned her affections
cooled as rapidly as they rose.
Lady Jane blushed very much, and said ``that she did not understand
politics, which she left to wiser heads than cr's; but though Mamma was,
no doubt, correct, Mr. Crawled hal spoken beautifully.'' And when the
ladies were retiring at the conclusion of their visit, Miss Crawled hoped
` Lady Southdown would be so kind as to send her Lady Jane sometimes, if
she could be spared to come down and console a poor sick lonely old
woman.'' This promise was graciously recorded, and they separated upon
great terms of amity.
`Don't let Lady Southdown come again, Pitt,'' said the old lady.  She
is stupid and pompous like all your mother's family, whom I never could
endure. But bring that nice good-nature little Lady lane as often as ever
you please.'' Pitt promised that he would do so. He did not tell the
Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship,
who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most delightful and
majestic impression on Miss Crawled.
And so, nothing loth to comfort n sick lady, and perhaps not sorry in
her heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the
Reverend Bartholomew Irons, and the serious stories who gathered round
the footstool of the pompous Countess, her mamma, Lady Jane became a
pretty constant visitor to Miss Crawled, accompanied her in her drives, and
solace many of her evenings. She was so naturally good and soft, that
even Firkin was not jealous of her; and the gentle Brings thought her
friend was less cruel to her, when kind Lady Jane was by, Towards her

Ladyship Miss Crawled's manners were charming. The old spinster told her
a thousand anecdotes about her mouth, talking to her in a very different
strain from that in which she had been accustomed to converse with the
godless little Rebecca; for there was that in Lady Jane's innocence which
rendered light talking impertinence before her, and Miss Crawled was too
much of a gentlewoman to offend such purity. The young lady herself
had never received kindness except from this old spinster, and her brother
and father : and she repaid Miss Crawled's penitent by artless sweetness
and friendship.
In the autumn evenings (when Rebecca was flannting at Paris, the
guests among the gay conquerors there, and our Amelia, our dear wounded
Amelia, all where was she ) Lady Jane would be sitting in Miss Crawled's
drawing-room singing sweetly to her, in the twilight, her little simple
songs and hymns, while the sun was setting and the sea was ronring on
the beach. The old spinster used to wake up when these ditties ceased,
and ask for more. As for Brings, and the quantity of tears of happiness
which she now shed as she pretended to knit, and looked out at the
splendid ocean darkling before the windows, and the lamps of heaven
beginning more brightly to shine-who, I say, can measure the happiness
and sensibility of Brings'

or a Missionary Register by his side, took that kind of reereation which
suits romantic and unromantic men after dinner. He sit Madeira : built
castles in the air: thought himself a fine fellow : felt himself much more
in love with Jane than he had been any time these seven years, during
which their liaison had lasted without the slightest impatience on Pitt's
part-and slept a good deal. When the time for coffee came, Mr. Bowls
used to enter it a noisy manner, and summon Squire Pitt, who would be
found in the dark very busy with his pamphlet.
I wish, my love, I could get somebody to play picture with me,''
Miss Crawled said, one night, when this functionnry made his appearance
with the candles and the coffee. `Poor Brings can no more play than an
owl, she is so stupid'' (the spinster always took an opportunity of absing
Brings before the servants) ; ``and I think I should sleep better if I had
my game.''
At this Lady Jane blushed to the tips of her little ears, and down to the
end of her pretty fingers; and when Mr. Bowls had quitted the room,
and the door was quite shut, she said:
Miss Crawled, I can play a little. I used to-to play a little with
poor dear papa.''
Come and kiss me. Come and kiss me this instant, you dear good
little soul,'' cried Mis Crawled in an ecstacy; and in this picturesque and
friendly occupation Mr. Pitt found the old Lady and the young one, when
he came up-stairs with his pamphlet in his hand. How she did blush all
the evening, that poor Lady Jane

shire and Sussex lie very close together, and Mrs. But had friends in the
latter county who took care to inform her of all, and a great deal more
than all, that passed ut Miss Crawled's house at Brighton. Pitt was there
more and more. He did not come for months together to the Ill, where
his abominable old father abandoned himself completely to rum and water,
and the odious society of the Horrors family. Pitt's success rendered
the Rector's family furious, and Mrs. But regretted more (though she
confessed less) than ever her monstrous fault is so insulting Miss bRings,
and in being so haughty and parsimonious to Bowls and Firkin, that
she had not a single person left in Miss Crawled's household to give her
information of what took place there.  It was all But's collar-bone,''
she persisted in saying; '` if that had not broke, I never would have left
her. I am a martyr to duty and to your odious unelerical habit of
hunting, But.''

divine interposed.  you're a clever woman, but you 've got a devil of a

``Jim might go down and see her, certainly,'' the housewife said;
ndling, with a sigh, `` If we could but get one of the girls into the house;
but she could never endure them, because they are not pretty.'' Those
unfortunate and well-educated women made themselves heard from the
neighbouring drawing-room, where they were thrusting away, with hard
fingers, an elaborate music-piece on the piano-forte, as their mother spoke;
and indeed they were at music, or at backwards, or at geography, or at
history, the whole day long. But what avail all these accomplishments, in

her hands; and Jim coming in from the stable at this minute, through
the parlour window, with a short pipe stuck in his oil-skin cap, he and his
father fell to talking about odds on the St. Leer, and the colloquy between
the Rector and his wife ended.
Mrs. But did not argue much good to the cause from the sending of
her son James as an ambussalexr, und saw him depart in rather a despairing
mood. Nor did the young fellow himself, when told what his mission was
to be, expect much pleasure or benefit from it; but he was consoled by
the thought that possibly the old lady would give him some handsome
remembrance of her, which would pay a few of his most pressing bills nt
the commencement of the ensuing Oxford term, and so took his place by
the couch from Southampton, and was safely landed at Brighton on the same
evening, with his portmanteau, his favourite bull-dog Tower, and an
immense basket of farm and garden produce, from the dear lectory folks
to the dear Miss Crawled. Considering it was too late to disturb the
invalid lady on the first night of his arrival, he put up at an inn, and
did not wait upon Miss Crawled until a late hour in the noon of next day.
James Crawled, when his aunt had Inst beheld him, was a gawky land, at
that uncomfortable age when the voice arisen between an uncnrthly treble
and preternatural base; when the face not uncommonly hlooms out with
appearances for which Rowlnand's Kalydor is said to not as a cure; when
boys are seen to have furtiely with their sister's scissors, and the sight
of other young women produces intolerable sensntions of terror in them;
when the great hands and ankles protrude a long way from garments which
have grown too tight for them; when their presence after dinner is at once
frightful to the ladies, who are whispering in the twilight in the drawing-
room, and inexpressibly odious to the gentlemen over the mahogany, who
are restrained from freedom of intercourse and delightful interchange of
it by the presence of that gawky innocence; when, at the conclusion of
the second glass, papa say, ``lack, my boy, go out and see if the evening
holds up,'' and the youth, willing to be free, yet hurt at not being yet a
man, quite the incomplete bnnquet. James, then a hobbadehoy, was now
become a young man, having had the benefits of a university education,
and required the inestimable polish, which is gained by living in a fast set
at a small college, and contracting debts, und being rusticated, and being
plucked.
He was  handsome lad, however, when he came to present himself to
his aunt at Brighton, and good looks were always a title to the feet old
lady's favour. Nor did his blushes and awkwardness take away from it:
she was pleased with these healthy tokens of the young gentleman's
ingenuousness.
He said `he had come down for a couple of days to see a man of his
college, and-and to pay my respects to you, I'am, and my father's and
mother's, who hope you are well.''
Pitt was in the room with Miss Crawled when the lad was announced,
and looked very blank when his ne was mentioned. The old lady had
plenty of humour, and enjoyed her correct nephew's perplexity. She
asked after all the people at the Rectory with great interest ; and said she
was thinking of paying them a visit. She praised the lad to his face, and

said he was well-grown and very much improved, and that it was a pity
his sisters had not some of his good looks; and finding, on inquiry, that
he had taken up his quarters at an hotel, would not hear of his stopping
there, but bnle Mr. Bowls sent for Mr. James Crawled's things instantly;
``and hark ye, Bowls,'' she added, with great grciousness, ``you will
have the goodness to pay Mr. James's bill.''
She flung Pitt a look of arch triumph, which caused that diplomntist
almost to choke with envy. Much as he had ingratiated himself with his
aunt, she had never yet invited him to stay under her roof, and here was
a young whisper-snapper, who at first sight was made welcome there.
I beg your pardon, Sir,'' says HBowls, advancing with a profound
bow; ``what hotel, Sir, shall Thomas fetch the luggage from P''
O, dam,'' said young James, starting up, as if in some plan,
I'I go.''
e What I'' said Miss Crawled.
The Tom Right's Arms,'' said James, blushing deeply.
Miss Crawled burst out laughing at tis title. Mr. Bowls gare one
abrupt guffaw, as a conlilential servant of the family, but choked the rest
of the valley; the diplomntist only smiled.
I-I didn't know any better,'' said James, looking down.  I'never
been here before; it was the coachman told me.'' The young story-
teller1 The fact is, that on the Southampton coach, the day previous,
James Crawled had met the Tutbury Pet, who was coming to Brighten to
make a match with the Rottingdean Fierce; and enchanted by the et's
conversation, had passed the evening in company with that scientific man
and his friends, at the inn in question.
I-I'd best go and settle the score,'' James continued. "Could'I
think of asking you, Ma'am,'' he added, generously.
This delicacy made his aunt laugh the more.
Go and settle the bill, Bowls,'' she said, with a wave of her hand,
` and bring it to me,''
Poor lady, she did not know what she had done tHere-there'sea
little da,'' said James, looking frightfully guilty. I'd best go for him.
He bites footmen's calves.''
All the party cried out with laughing at this description; even Brings
and Lady Jane, who was sitting mute during the interview between Miss
Crawled and her nephew; and Bowls, without a word, quitted the room.
Still, by way of punishing her elder nephew, Miss Crawled persisted in
being gracious to the young Oxonian. There were no limits to her kind-
ness or her compliments when they once began. She told Pitt he might
come to dinner, and insisted that James should accompany her in her drive,
and paraded him solemnly up and down the cliff, on the back seat of the
barouche. During all this excursion, she condescended to say civil things
to him: she quoted Italian and French poetry to the poor bewildered
lad, and persisted that he was a fine scholar, and was perfectly sure h
would ruin a gold meal, and be a Senior Wrangler.
: Had, had,'' laughed James, encouraged by these compliments,;
 Senior Wrangler, indeed; that 's at the other shop.''
What is the other shop, my dear child I'' said the lady.

dressed in white flannel coats, with mother-of-pearl buttons, his friends
the Tutbury Pet and the Rottinglean Timber, with three other gentlemen
of their acquaintance, who all saluted poor James there in the carriage as
he sat. This incident damned the ingenuous youth's spirits, and no word
of yea or nay could he be induced to utter during the rest of the drive.
On his return he found his room prepared, and his portmanteau ready,
and might have remarked that MIr, Bowls's countenance, when the latter
conducted him to his apartment, wore a look of gravity, wonder, and
compassion. But the thought of Mr. Bowls did not enter his head. He
was exploring the dreadful predicament in which he found himself, in a
house full of old women, jabbering French and Italian, all talking poetry
to him. ` Regularly up a tree, by single'' exclaimed the molest boy, who
could not face the gentlest of her sex-not even Brings-when she began
to talk to him ; whereas, put him at Linley Lock, and he could out-slang
the boldest bargeman.
At dinner, James appeared choking in a white neckcloth, and had the
honour of hanging my Lady Jane down stairs, while Brings and Mr.
Crawled followed afterwards, conducting the old lady, with her apparatus
of bundles, and shawls, and cushions. Half of Brings's tie at dinner
was spent in supcrintending the invalid's comfort, and in cutting up
chicken for her fat spaniel. James didn talk much, but le made a point
of asking all the ladies to drink wine, and accepted MIr. Crawled's coal-
lenge, and consumed the greater part of a bottle of champagne which Mr,
Bowls was ordered to produce in his honour. The ladies having with-
drawn, and the two cousins being left together, Pitt, the ex-diplomatist,
became very communicative and friendly. He asked after James's career
at college-what his prospects in life were-hope heartily he would get
on: and, in a word, was frank and amiable. James's tongue unloosed
with the Port, and he told his cousin his life, his prospects, his debts, his
troubles at the little-go, and his rows with the proctors, filling rapidly
from the bottles before him, and flying from Port to Mndeira with joyous
activity.
 The chief pleasure which my aunt has,'' said Mr. Crawled, fling his
glass, ``is that people should do as they like in her house. This is Liberty
HIll, James, and you can't do Miss Crawled a greater kindness than to do
as you please, and ask for what you will. I know you have all sneered at
me in the country for being n or. Miss Crawled is liberal enough to
suit any fancy. She is a Republican in principle, and despised everything
like rank or title.''
Why are you going to marry an Earl's daughter ?'' said James.
My dear friend, remember it is not poor Lady Jane's fault that she is
well born,'' Pitt replied with a costly air.  She cannot help being a
lady. Besides, I am a Tory, you know.''
O as for that,'' said Jim, ' there 's nothing like old blood; no, dammy,
nothing like it. I 'n none of your radical. I know what it is to be a

absurdity,-'` you don't care about a dawn or a rat; it's all nonsense.
I'm blest if I think you know the difference between a dog and a luck.''
No; by the way,'' Pitt continued with increased blackness, ``it was
about blood you were talking, and the personal advantages which people
derive from patrician birth. Here's the fresh bottle.''
 Blood's the world,'' sail James, pulling the ruby fluid down. `Nothing

at Oxford, the men passed round the bottle a little quicker than you you
fellows seem to do.''
``Come, come,'' said James, putting his hand to his nose no winking
at his cousin with a pair of obvious eyes, `` no jokes, old boy; no trying it
out on me. you want to trot me out, but it'so go. In vino verdict, old

ingens iterabimus equor,''' and the Bacchanalian quoting the above with
a House of Commons air, tossed of nearly a thimblefull of wine with
an immense flourish of his glass.
At the rectory, when the bottle of port wine was opened after dinner, the
young ladies had each a glass from a bottle of currant wine. Mrs. But
took one glass of port, honest James had a couple commonly, but as his
father grew very sulky if he made further inroads on the bottle, the good
lad generally refrained from trying for more, and subsiled either into the
currant wine, or to some private gin-and-water in the stables, which he
enjoyed in the company of the coachman and his pipe. At Oxford, the
quantity of wine was unlimited, but the quality was interior : but when
quantity and quality united, as at his aunt's house, James slow that he

could appreciate them indeed; and hardly needed any of his cousin's
encouragement in draining of the second bottle supplied by MIr. Bowls.
When the time for coffee came, however, and for a return to the ladies,
of whom he stood in awe, the young gentleman's agreeable frankness left
him, and he relapsed into his usual surly timidity: contenting himself by
saying yes and no, by scowling at LAdy Jane, and by upsetting one cup of
coffee during the evening.
If he did not speak he yawned in a pitiable manner, and his presence
threw a damp upon the modest proceedings of the evening, for Miss
Crawled and Lady Jane at their piqued, and Miss Brings at her work, felt
that his eyes were wildly fixed on then, and were uneasy under that
hamlin look.
He seems a very silent, awkward, bashful lad,'' said Miss Crawled to
Mr. Pitt.
He is more cormunicative in men's society than with ladies,'' Machia-
ve dryly replied: perhaps rather disappointed that the port wine had not
made lAin speak more.,
DIe had spent the early part of the next morning in writing home to
his mother a most flourishing account of his reception by Miss Crawled.
But all he little knew what evils the day was bringing for him, and how
short his reign of favour was destined to be. A circumstance which Jim
had forgotten-a trivial but fatal circumstance-had taken place at the
Cries's As on the night before le had come to his aunt's house. It
was no other than this-Jim, who was always of a generous disposition,
and when in his cups especially hospitable, had in the course of the night
treated the Tutbury champion and the Roltingdean man, and their friends,
twice or thrice to the refreshment of in-and-water-to that no less than
eighteen glasses of that fluid at eight-pence per glass were charged in
MIr. James Crawled's bill. It was not the amount of eight-pences, but
the quantity of gin which told fatally against poor James's character, when
his aunt's butler, Mr. Bowls, went down at his mistress's request to pay
the young gentleman's bill. The landlord, fearing lest the country should
be refused altogether, swore solemnly that the young gent had consumed
personally every farthing's worth of the liquor: and Bowls paid the bill
finally, and showed it on his return home to MRs. Firkin, who was
shocked at the frightful prodigality of in; and took the bill to Miss
Brings as accountant-general; who thought it her duty to mention the
circumstance to her principal, Miss Crawled.
HAd he drunk a dozen bottles of claret the old spinster could hare
pardoned him. Mr. Fox and MIr. Sheridan drank claret. Gentlemen
drank claret. But eighteen glasses of gin consumed among bowers in an
ignoble pot-house-it was an odious crime and not to be pardoned readily.
Everything went against the lad: e came home pertumed from the
stables, whither he had been to pay his dog Tower a visit-and whence
he was going to take his friend out for an airing, when he met Miss Crawled
and her where Blenheim spanicl, which Tower would have eaten up

A NOVEL WITH A HERO.

This day too the unlucky of's modesty had likewise forsaken him.
DIe was lively and facetiously at dinner. During the repast he lcvellel one
or two jokes against Pitt Crawled: he drank as much wine as upon the
previous day : and going quite suspiciously to the drawing-room began
to entertain the ladies there with some choice Oxford stories. DIe described
the different pugilistie qualities of Molyneus and Dutch Am, offered
playfully to give Lady Jane the owls upon the Tutbury Pet against the
Rottingdean man, or take them, as her Ladyship chose: and crowned the
plecnsntry by proposing to back himself against his cousin Pitt Crawled,
either with or without the gloves. `And that 's an fair offer, my back,'' he
said, with a loud laugh, slapping Pitt on the shoulder, ``and my father
told me to make it too, and he'll go hlves in the bet, ha hal'' Sa
saying, the engaging youth nodded knowingly at poor MIss Brings, and
pointed his thumb over his shoulder at IPitt Crawled in a jocular and
exulting manner.
Pitt was not pleased altogether perhaps, but still not unhappy in the
ain. Poor Jim had his laugh out : and staggered across the room with
his aunt's candle, when the old lady moved to retire, and offered to salute.
1her with the blandest tipsy smile: :and he took his own leave and went up-
stairs to his bed-room perfectly satisfied with himself, and with a pleased
notion that his aunt's money would be left to him in preference to his
father and all the rest of his family.
Once up in the bet-room, one would have thought he could not make
matters worse; and yet this unlucky bodily. ho manon was shining
very pleasantly out on the sc, und .li., :treated t the window by the
romantic appearance of the on :l the heaven-, thought he would

blowing inwards and a fire thorough draft being established, the clouds of
tobacco were carried down-stairs, and carried with quite undiminished
fragrance to Miss Crawled and Miss lriggs.
That pipe of tobacco finished the business: and the Mute-Crawled
never knew how many thousand pound it cost them. Firkin rushed down-
stairs to Bowls who was reading out the `` Fire and the Frying Pan'' to
his side-de-camp in a loud and ghostly voice. The dreadful secret was
told to him by Firkin with so frightened a look, that for the first moment
Mr. Bowls and his young man thought that flowers were in the house
the legs of whom had probably been discovered by the woman under MIss
Crawled's bed. When made aware of the fact however-to rush up-stairs
nt three steps at a time-to enter the unconscious James's apartment,
calling out,  MIr. James,'' in a voice stifled with alarm, and to cry ' For
Gall's sake, Sir, stop that 'are pipe,'' was the work of a minute with
MIr. Bowls. :O, Mr. James, what 'are you lone,'' he said in a voice of
the deepest pathos, as he threw the implement out of the window. e What
have you done, Sir; Misses can't abide 'em.''
`Missis needn't smoke,'' said James with a frantic misplaced laugh,
and thought the whole matter an excellent joke. But his feelings were

beard which he was so anxiously expecting, handed a note into Mr. James
in bed, in the handwriting of Miss Brings.
` Dear Sir,'' it said, `` Miss Crawled has passed an exceedingly did
turned night, owing to the shoeing manner in which the house has been
polluted by tobacco; Miss Crawled bids me say she regrets that she is too
unwell to see you before you go-and above all, that she ever induced you
to remove from the ale-house, where she is sure you will be much more
comfortable during the rest of your stay at Brighton.''
And herewith honest James's career as a candidate for his aunt's four
ended. He Had in fact, and without knowing it, done what he menaeed
to do. He had fought his cousin Pitt with the gloves.

splendour and gaiety. Recent was a good economist, and the price
poor Joy Sedley had paid for her two horses was in itself sufficient to
keep their little establishment afloat for a year, at the least; there was no
occasion to turn into money `` my pistols, the same which I shot Captain
Manner,'' or the gold dressing-case, or the cloak lined with snble. Beck
had it made into a pelisse for herself, in which she rode in the Boys de
Boulogne to the admiration of all: and you should have seen the scene
between her and her delighted husband, whom she rejoinel after the army

with infinite fur, carried up his delight to a pitch of quite insane went-
siasm. He believed in his wife as much as the French soldiers ins
Napoleon.
Her success in Paris was remarkable. All the French ladies owed her
charming. She spoke their language admirably. She adopted at once
their grace, their liveliness, their manner. Her husband was stupid her-
vainly-all English are stupid-and, besides, a dull husband at Paris is
always a point in a lady's favour. He was the heir of the rich and
spiritless Miss Crawled, whose house had been open to so many of the
French noblesse during the emigration. They received the Colonel's wife
in their own hotels- Why,'' wrote a great lady to Miss Crawled, who had
bought her lace and trinkets at the Duchess's own price, and given her
many a dinner during the pinching times after the Revolution--v WHy

ciously she had made use of Miss Crawled's name, to get an entrce into
Parisian society. Too much shaken in mind and body to compose a letter
in the French large in reply to that of her correspondent, she dictated
to Brings a furious answer in her own native tongue, repudiating Mrs.
Rawdon Crawled altogether, and warming the public to beware of her as
a most artful and dangerous person. But as madame the Duchess of
N- had only been twenty years in England, she did not understand
single word of the language, and contented herself by informing Mrs.
Rawlon Crawled at their next meeting, that she had received a charing
letter from that care lInes, and that it was full of beneolent things for
MIss. Crawled, who began seriously to hae hopes that the spinster would
relent.
Meanwhile, she was the grapes and most admired of Englishwomen: and
had a little European coyness on her reception-night-Prussians and Co-
sacks, spaniards and English-all the world was at Paris during this famous
winter: to lace seen the stars and cordons in Rebecca's humble saloon
would have made all Baker Street pale with envy. Famous warriors rode
by her carriage in the Boys, or crowded her modest little box at the Opera.
Rawdon as in the highest spirits. There were no dens in Paris as yet:
there were parties every day at Very's or Beauillicrs'; play was plentiful
and his luck good. Tufts perhaps was sulky. MRs. Tufts hid come
over to Paris at her own invitation, and besides this contents, there
were a score of general now round Beck's chair, and she might take her
choice of a dozen bouquets when she went to the play. Lady Bareacres
and the chief of the English society, stupid and irreproachable females,
writhed with anguish at the success of the little upstart Been, whose
poisoned jokes quivered and rankled in their chaste breasts. But she had
all the men on her side. She fought the women with indomitable courage,
and they could not talk scandal in any tongue but their own.
So in either, pleasures, and prosperity, the winter of 1815-10 passed
away with MRs. Rawdon Crawled, who accommodated herself to polite life
as if her ancestors had been people of fashion for centuries past-and
who from her wit, talent, and energy, indeed merited a place of honour
in Vanity Fair. In the early spring of 1816, Malignant's Journal con-
gained the following announcement in an interesting corner of the paper:
On the 26th of MIrth-the Lady of Lieutenant-Colonel Morley, of the
Life Guards Green-of a son and heir,''
This event was copicd into the London papers, out of which Miss
Brings read the statement to Miss Crawled, at breakfast, at Brighton.
The intelligence, expected as it might have been, caused a crisis in the
affairs of the Crawled family. The spinster's rage one to its height,
and sending instantly for Pitt, her nephew, and for the Lady Southdown,
from Brunswick Square, she requested an immediate celebration of the
marriage which had been so long bending between the two families.
And she announced that it was her intention to allow the young couple a
thousand a year during her lifetime, at the expiration of which the bulk
of her property would be settled upon her nephew and her der niece,
Lady Jane Crawled. Way came down to ratify the deeds-Lord
A NoVEL WITHOUT A RIVER.
311
Southdown gave away his sister-she was married by a Bishop, and not
by the Red. Dartholomew Irons-to the disappointment of the irregular
prelate.
When they were married-Pitt would have liked to take a wheel tour
with his bride, as became people of their condition. But the affection of
the old lady towards Lady are lad grown so strong, that she firmly
owned she could not part with her favourite. Pitt and his wife came
therefore, and lived with Miss Crawled: and (greatly to the annoyance of
poor Pitt, who conceived himself a most injured character-being subject
to the humours of his aunt on one side and of his mother-in-law on the
other,) Lady Southdown, from her neighbouring house, reigned over the
whole family-Pitt, Lady Due, Miss Craven, rings, Bowls, Firkin, and
all. She pitiless dosed them with her tracts and her medicine: she
dismissed Creamer, she installed Fingers, and soon stripped Miss Crawled
of even the semblance of authority. The poor soul grew so timid that
she actually left of bullying Brings any more, and clung to her niece,
more fond and more terrified every day. Pence to the, kind and selfish,
vain and generous old henthen I-We shall see the no more. Let us
hope that Lady Jane supported her kindly, and led her with gentle hand
out of the busy struggle of Vanity Fair.

HE news of the great fights ol
uatre Brass and Waterloo
reached England at the same
time. The Gazette first put-
wished the result of the two
battles; at which glorious in-
intelligence all England thrilled
with triumph and fear. Par-
ticulars then followed; and
after the announcement of the
victories came the list of the
wounded and the slain. Who
can tell the dread with which
that cutalogue was opened and
rend. Fancy, at eery village
and homestead almost through
the three kingdom, the great
news coming of the battles of
Flanders, and the feelings of exultation and gratitude, bereavement and
sickening;g dismay, when the lists of the regimcntal mosses were gone
through, and it became know whether the dear friend and relative
had escaped or had fallen. Anybody who will take the trouble of
looking back to a file of the newspapers of the time, must, even now,
feel at second-hand this breathless pause of expectation. The list of
casualties are carried on from day to day: you stop in the midst as in a
story which is to be continued in our next. Think what the feelings must
have been as those papers followed inch other fresh from the press; and if
such an interest could be felt in our country, and about a battle where but
twenty thousand of our people were engaged, think of the condition of
Europe for twenty years before, where people were fighting, not by thou-
sands, but by millions; each one of whom as he struck his enemy wounded
horribly some other innocent heart far away.
The news which that famous Gazette brought to the Osbornes gare a
dreadful shock to the family and its chief. The girls indulged unrestrained
in their grief. The gloom-stricken old father was still more borne down
by his fate and sorrow. He strove to think that a judgment was on the
boy for his disobedience. He dared not own that the severity of the
sentence frightened him, and that its fulfilment had come too soon upon
his curses. Sometimes a shuddering terror struck him, as if he had been
the author of the room which he had called down on his son. There was
A NOEIL W1TH0OUT A HERO.

n chance before of reconciliation. The boy's wife might have died; or he
might have come back and sin, Father I have sinned. But there was no
hope now. He stood on the other side of the gulf impassable, haunting
lis parent with sad eyes. He remembered them once before so in a fear,
when every one thought the lad was dying, and i lay on his bed speech-
less, and gazing with a dreadful gloom. Good God how the father clung
to the doctor then; and with what a sickening anxiety he followed him:
what a weight of grief was off his mind when, after the crisis of the feel,
the lad recovered, and looked at his father once more with eyes that rough-
nized him. But now there was no help or cure, or chance of reconcile-
ment: above all, there were no humble words to soothe vanity outraged
and furious, or bring to its natural flow the poisoned, angry blood. And
it is hard to say which pang it was tore the proud father's heart most
keenly-that his son should have gone out of the reach of his forgive-
ness, or that the apology which his own pride expected should have
escaped him.
WHatever his sensations might have been, however, the stern old man
would have no confidant. He never mentioned his son's name to his
daughters ; but ordered the elder to place all the females of the cstablisl-
ment in mourning; and desired that the male servants should be similar
attired in deep black. All parties and entertainment, of course, were to
be put off. No communications were made to his future son-in-law, whose
marriage-day had been fixed; but there was enough in MIr. Borne's
appearance to prevent Mr. Bullock from making any inquiries, or in any
way pressing forward that ceremony. ICe and the ladies whispered about
it under their voices in the drawing-room sometimes, whither the father
never came. He remained constantly in his own study; the whole front
part of the house being closed until some time after the completion of the
general mourning.
About three weeks after the 18th of June, Mr. Borne's acquaintance,
Sir William Doing, called at Mr. Borne's house in Trusses square, with
a very pale and agitated face, and insisted upon seeing that gentleman.
Ushered into his room, and after a few words, which neither the speaker
nor the host understood, the former produced from an enclosure a letter
sealed with a large red seal.  My son, Mnjor Doing,'' the Alderman
said, with some hesitation, `` dispatched me a letter by an officer of the
--th, who arrived in town to-day. My son's letter contains one for you,
Scorned.'' The Alderman placed the letter on the table, and Borne
stared at him for a moment or two in silence. His looks frightened the
ambassador, who, after looking guiltily for a little time at the grief-stricken
man, hurried away without a farther word.
The letter was in George's well-known bold hand-writing. It was that
one which he had written before day-break on the 16th of June, and just
before he took leave of Amelia. The great red seal was emblazoned with
the sham coat of arms which Scorned had assumed from the Peerage, with
Dax in bell'' for a motto; that of the usual house with which the vain
old man tried to fancy himself connected. The hand that signed it would
never hold pen or sword more. The very seal that sealed it had been
robbed from George's dead body as it lay on the field of battle. The

father knew nothing of this, but out and looked at the letter in terrified
vacancy. He almost fell when he went to open it.

What a dreary mourning it is to dwell upon those vehement protests of

What dark, cruel comments upon Life and Vanities Most of us have
got or written drawers full of them. They are closet-skeletons which we
keep and shun. Osborue trembled long, before the letter from his dead son.
The poor boy's letter did not say much. He had been too proud to
knowledge the tenderness which his heart felt. He only said, that on
the eve of a great battle, e wished to bid his father farewell, and solemnly
to implore his good offices for the wife-it might be for the child-whom
he 1left behind him. He owned with contrition that his irregularities and
extravagance had already wasted a large part of his mother's little fortune.
He thanked lis father for his former generous conduct; and he promised
him, that if he fell on the field or survived it, he would act in a manner
worthy of the name of George Borne.
IIi English habit, pride, awkwardness perhaps, had prevented him
from saying more. His father could not see the kiss George had placed on
the superscription of his letter. MIr. Borne dropped it with the bitterest,
lcndliest pang of balked affection and revenge. His son was still beloved
and unforgiven.
About two months afterwards however, as the young ladies of the
family went to church with their father, they remarked how he took a
different seat from that which he usually occupied when he chose to
attend divine worship; and that from his cushion opposite, he looked up
at the wall over their heads. This caused the young women likewise
to gaze in the direction towards which the father's gloomy eyes pointed:
and they saw an elaborate monument upon the wall, where Britannia was
represented weeping over an urn, nd a broken sword, and a coachman
lion, indicated that the piece of sculpture had been erected in honour of a
deceased warrior. The sculntors of those days had stocks of such funeral
emblems in hand; as you may see still on the walls of St. Paul's, which
are covered with hundreds of these braggart heathen allegories. There
was a constant demand for them during the first fifteen years of the
present century.
Under the memories in question were emblazoned the well known and
pompous Borne arms; and the inscription said, that the monument was
Sacred to the memory of George Borne, Junior, s., late a Captain
in his Majesty's -th regiment of foot, who fell on the l8th of June, 1815,
aged 28 years, while fighting for his king and country in the glorious
victory of Wnterloo. Dulce et deceorm est pro afraid more,''
The sight of that stone agitated the nerves of the sisters so much, that
Miss Maria was compelled to leave the church. The congregation made
way resectfully for those sobbing girls clothed in deep black, and pitied
the stern old father seated opposite the memory of the dead soldier.
 Will he forgive Mrs. George'' the girls said to themselves as soon as
their ebullition of grief was over. Much conversation passed too among

the acquaintances of the Borne family, who knew of the ruptre between
the son and father caused by the former's marriage, s to the chance of a
reconciliation with the young widow. There were bits among the
gentlemen both about Trusser Square and in the City.
If the sisters had any anxiety regarding the possible recognition of
Amelia as a daughter of the family, it was increased presently, and towards
the end of the autumn, by their father's announcement that he was going
abroad. He did not say whither, but they knew at once that his steps
would be turned towards Belgium, and were aware that George's widow
was still in Brussels. They had pretty aecurate news indeed of poor
Amelia from Ll Doing and her daughters. Our honest Captain had
been promoted in consequence of the death of the second hIajor of the
regent on the field; and the brave O'Down, who had distinguished
himself greatly here as upon all occasions where he had a chance to she
his coolness and valour, was a Colonel and Companion of the Bath.
Very many of the bare -th, who had suffered severely upon both days
of action, were still at Brussels in the autumn, recovering of their wounds.
The city was a vast military hospital for months alter the great battles;
and as men and officers began to rally from their hurts, the .gardens and
places of public resort swarmed with maimed warriors old and young,
who, just result out of death, fell to gambling, and gaiety, and love-
making, as people of Vanity Fair will do. Mr. Borne found out some
of the -th easily. He knew their uniform quite well, and had been
used to follow all the promotion and exchanges in the regiment, and
loved to talk about it and its oficers as if he had been one of the number.
On the day after his arrival at Brussels, and as he issued from his hotel,
which faced the park, he saw a soldier in the well-known facings, reposing
on a stone-bench in the garden, and went and sat down trembling by the
wounded convalescent man.
wEre you in Captain Borne's company'' he said, and added, after
a pause, "`he was my son, Sir,''
The man was not of the Captain's company, but he lifted up his
unwoundel arm and touched his cap sadly and respeectfully to the haggard
broken-spirited gentleman who questioned him. ` The whole army didn't
contain a fner or a better officer,'' the soldier said. :The sergeant of
the Captain's company (Captain Rayond had it now), was in town
though, and was just well of a shot in the shoulder. His honour might
see him if he liked, who could tell him anything he wanted to know about
-about the -'s actions. But his honour had seen Msjor Doing no
doubt, the brave Captain's great friend; and Mrs. Borne, who was
here too, and had been very bad, he heard everybody say. They say she
was out of her mind like for six weeks or more. But your honour knows
all about that-and asking your pardon ''-the man added.
Borne put a guinea into the soldier's hand, and told him he should
have another if he would bring the sergeant to the HOtel du Are;: a
promise which very soon brought the desired officer to MIr. Borne's
presence. And the first soldier went away; and after telling a comrade
or two how Captain Borne's father was arrived, and what a free-handed
generous gentleman he was, they went and made good cheer with drink

and feasting, as long as the guineas lasted which had come from the proud
purse of the mourning old father.
In the Serjent's company, who was also just convalescent, Borne
made the journey of Waterloo and uatre Brass, a journey which
thousands of his countrymen were then taking. He took the Sergeant
with him in his carriage, and went through both fields under his guidance.
He saw the point of the road where the regiment marched into action
on the 16th, and the slope down which they drove the French carry
who were pressing on the retreating Belgians. There was the spot where
the noble Captain cut down the French officer who was grappling with the
young Ensign for the colours, the Colour-Sergeants having been shot
down. Along this road they retreated on the next day, and here was the
bank nt which the regiment bivouaeked under the rain of the night of the
seventeenth. Further on was the position which they took and held during
the day, forming time after time to receive the charge of the enemy's
horsemen, and lying down under shelter of the bank from the furious
fRench cannonade. And it was at this declivity when at evening the
whole English line received the order to advance, is the enemy fell back
after his lot charge, that the Captain hurrying and rushing down the
hill waving his sword, received a shot and felled. `` It was Major Doing
who took back the Captain's body to Brussels,'' the Sergeant said, in a
low voice, ``and had him buried, as your HOnour knows,'' The peasants
and relic-hunters about the place were screaming round the pair, as the
soldier told his story, offering for sale all sorts of movements of the fight,
crosses, and epaulets, and shattered cuirass, and eagles.
Borne gave a impetuous reward to the Sergeant when he parted with
him, after having visited the scenes of his son's lust exploits. His burial
place he had already seen. Indeed he had driven thither immediately
after his arrival at Brussels. George's body lay in the pretty burial-
ground of Linen, near the city ; in which place, having once visited it on
a party of pleasure, he had lightly expressed a wish to have his grave
male. And there the young flicker was laid by his friend, in the union-
repeated corner of the garden, separated by a little hedge from the temples
and towns and plantations of flowers and shrubs, under which the Roman
Catholic lead repose. It seemed a humiliation to old Borne to think
that his son, an eNglish gentleman, a Captain in the famous British army,
should not be found worthy to lie in ground where mere foreigners were
buried. WHich of us is there can tell how much vanity lurks in our
warmest regard for others, and how selfish our love is Old Osborue
did not speculate much upon the mingled nature of his feelings, and how
his instinct and selfishness were combating together. He firmly believed
that everything he did was right, that he ought on all occasions to have
his own way-and like the sting of a wasp or serpent his hatred rushed
out named and poisonous against anything like opposition. He was
proud of his hatred as of everything else. Always to be right, always to
trample forward, and never to doubt, are not these the great qualities with
which dulness takes the lead in the world

gates of the city at sunset, they met another open barouche, in which

were a couple of ladies and a gentleman, and by the side of which an
officer was riding. Borne gave a start back, and the Sergeant, seated
with him cast a look of surprise at his neighbour, as he touched his cap
to the officer, who mechanically returned his salute. It was Amelia, with
the lamp young Ensign by her side, and opposite to her her faithful friend
Mrs. O'Down. It was Amelia, but how change from the fresh mud
comely girl Borne knew. Her face was white and thin. her pretty
brown hair was parted under a widow's cap-the poor child. ller eyes
were fixed, and looking nowhere. They stared blank in the face of
Borne, as the carriages crossed each other, but she did not know him;
nor did he recognise her, until looking up, he saw sObbing riding by her,
and then he knew who it was. He hated her. He did not know how
much until he saw her there. When her carriage had passed on, he
turned and stared at the Sergeant, with a curse and defiance in his eye,
cast at his companion, who could not help looking at him-as much
as to say. `` How dare to look at me Damn you: I do hate her.
It is she who has tumbled my hopes and all my pride down.''  Tall
the scoundrel to drive on quick,'' he shouted with an oath, to the lackey
on the box. A minute afterwards, a horse came clattering over the page-
ment behind Borne's carriage, and Doing rode up. His thoughts had
been elsewhere as the carriages passed each other, and it was not until he
had ridden some paces forward that he remembered it was Borne who
had just passed him. Then he turned to examine if the sight of her
father-in-law had made an impression on Amelia, but the poor girl did
not know who had passed. Then William, who daily used to accompany
her in his drives, taking out his watch, made some excuse about an
engagement which he suddenly recollected, and so rode of. She did not
remark that either: but sat looking before her, over the homely landscape
towards the woods in the distance, by which George marched away.
Mr. Borne, Mr. Osbornel'' cried Sobbing, as he rode up and held
out his hand. Borne made no motion to take it, but shouted out once
more and with another curse to his servant to drive on.
Doing laid his hand on the carriage side. I will see you, Sir,'' he
said. ``I have a message for you.''
From that woman P'' soil Borne, fiercely.
No,'' replied the other, ``from your son;'' at which Scorned fell back
into the corner of his carriage, and Doing allowing it to pass on, rode
close behind it, and so through the town until they reached Mr. Borne's
hotel, and without a word. There he followed Borne up to his apart-
meets. George had often been in the rooms; they were the lodgings
which the Trawlers had occupied during their stay in Brussels.
 Pray, have you any commands for me, Captain Doing, or, I c
your pardon, I should say Mayor Doing, since better men than you are
dead, and you step into their shoes,'' said Mr. Borne, in that sarcastic
tone which he sometimes was pleased to assume.
 Better men are dead,'' Doing rcplicl. ' I want to speak to you
about one.''
MAke it short, Sir,'' said the other with an oath. scowling nt his
visitor.

kNIFE AIR.
I am here as his closest friend,'' the Major , resumed, ``and the
executors of his will. He made it before we went into action. Are you
aware how small his means are, and of the straitened circumstances of
his widow 
I don't known his widow, Sir,'' Borne said. `Let her go back to
her father,'' But the gentleman whom he addressed was determined to
remain in good temper, and went on without heeding the interruption.
 Do you know, Sir, Mrs. Borne's condition Her life and her
reason almost have been shaken by the blow which has fallen on her. It
is very doubtful whether she will rally. There is a chance left for her
however, and it is about this I came to speak to you. She will be a
mother soon. Will you visit the parent's offence upon the child's head:
or will you forgive the child for poor George's sake''
Borne broke out into a rhapsody of self-praise and imprecations. By
the first, excursion himself to his own conscience for his conduct; by the
second, exaggerating the undutifulucess of George. No father in all
England could have behaved more generously to a son, who had rebelled
against him wickedly. DIe had died without even so much as confessing
he was wrong. Let him take the consequences of his undutifulness and
folly. As for himself, Mr. Borne, he was a man of his word. He
had sworn never to speak to that woman or to recognise her as his son's
wife.  And that's what you may tell her,'' he concluded with an oath;
`'and that 's what I will stick to to the last day of my life.''
There was no hope from that quarter then. The widow must lie on
her slender pittancce, or on such aid ss Joy could give her. I might tell
her, and she would not heed it,'' thought Doing sadly: for the poor
girl's thoughts were not here nt all since her catastrophe, and stupefied
under the pressure of her sorrow, good and evil were like indifferent
to her. So, indeed, were even friendship and kindness. She received
them both uucomplainingly, und having accepted them, relapsed into
her grief.
suppose some twelve months after the above conversation took place
to have passed in the life of our poor Amelia. She has spent the first
portion of that time in a sorrow so profound and pitiable, that we who
have been watching and describing some of the emotions of that weak
and tender heart, must draw back in the presence of the cruel grief under
which it is bleeding. Tread silently round the hapless couch of the poor
prostrate soul. Shut gently the door of the dark chamber, wherein she
suffers, as those kind people did who nursed her through the first months
of her pain, and never left her until heaven had sent her consolation. A
day came-of almost terrified delight and wonder-when the poor widowed
girl pressed a child upon her breast,-a child, with the eyes of George
who was gone-a little boy, as beautiful as a cherub. What a miracle it
was to hear its first cry1 How she laughed and wept over it-how love,
and hope, and prayer woke again in her bosom as the baby nestled there.
She was safe. The doctors who attended her, and had feared for her Life
or for her brain, ad waited anxiously for this crisis before they could
pronounee that either was secure. It was worth the long months of doubt

and lead which the persons, who had constantly been with her, had
passed, to see her eyes once more beaming tenderly upon them.
Our friend Doing was one of them. It was he who brought her back
to England and to her mother's house; when Mrs. O'God, receiving a
peremptory summons from her Colonel, had been forced to quit her
patient. To ee Doing holding the infant, and to hear Amelia's laugh of
triumph as she watched him, would have done any man good who had a
sense of humour. William was the godfather of the child, and exerted his
ingenuity in the purchase of cups, spoons, pap-boats, and corals for this
little Christian.
How his mother nursed him, and dressed him, and lived upon him; low
she drove away all nurses, and would scarce allow any hand but her own
to touch him; how she considered that the greatest favour she could
confer upon his godfather, Major Doing, was to allow the MIajor occa-
sionally to handle him, need not be told here. This child was her being.
PIer existence was a maternal caress. She enveloped the feeble and
unconscious creature with love and worship. It was her life which the
baby drank in from her bosom. Of nights, and when alone, she had
stealthy and intense raptures of motherly love, such is God's marvellous
care has awarded to the female instinct-joys how far higher and lower
than reason-blind beautiful devotion which only women's hearts now.
It was William Doing's task to muse upon these moments of Aelia's,
and to watch her heart ; and if his love me him divine almost all the
feelings which agitated it, alas l he could see with n fatal pcrspicuity that
there was no place there for him. And so, gently, he bore lis fate, knowing
it, and content to bear it.
lI suppose Amelin's father and mother saw though the intentions of the
Major, and were not ill-disposed to encourage him; for Doing insisted
their house daily, and stayed for hours with them, or with Amclia, or with
the honest landlord, Mr. Clasp, and his family. He brought, on one
pretext or another, presents to everybody, and almost every day; and
went with the landlord's little girl who was rather a favourite with
Amelia, by the name of Moor Sugarplums. It was this little child who
commonly acted as mistress of the ceremonies to introduce him to Its.
Borne. She laughed one day when Mlajor Sugarplums' cab drove up to
Fulhm, and he descended from it, bringing out a woolen lose, a drum,
a trumpet, and other walked toys, for little Clergy, who was scarcely six
months old, and for whom the articles in question were entirely premature.
The child was asleep. `Hush,'' said Amelia, annoyed, perhaps, at the
creaking of the Mlajor's boots; and she held out her hand; smiling because
William could not take it until he had rid himself of his cargo of toys.
 Go down stairs, little Mary,'' said he presently to the well, 'I want to
speak to Mrs. Borne.'' She looked up rather astonished, and laid down
the infant on its bed.
 I am come to say good-bye, Amelia,'' said he, taking her slender little
white hand gently.
Good-bye?' and where are you going 2'' she said, with a smile.
`Send the letters to the agents,'' he said; `` they will forward them;
for you will write to e, won't you? I shall be away a long time.''
320
VANITY PAIN.
I'lI write to you about George,'' she said.  Dear William, how good
you have been to him and to do. Look at him Isn't he like an angel
The little pink hands of the child closed mechanically round the honest
soldier's finger, and Amelia looked up in his face with bright maternal
pleasure. The cruellest looks could not have wounded him more than that
glance of hopeless kindness. He bent over the child and mother. He
could not speak for a moment. And it was with all his strength that he
could force himself to say a God bless you. ``God bless you,'' said Amelia,
all held up her face and kissed him.
Hush.l Dont wake George I'' she added, as William Doing went to
the door with heavy steps. She did not hear the noise of his cab-wheels
as he drove away: she was looking at the child, who was laughing in his
sleep.

Some three or four years after his stay in Paris, when Rawdon Crawled
and his wife were established in a very small comfortable house in Curzon
Street, Affairs, there was scarcely one of the numerous friends whom they
entertained at dinner that did not ask the above question regarding them.
The novelist, it has been said before, knows everything, and as I am in
a situation to be able to tell the public how Crawled and his wife live
without any income, may I entreat the public newspapers which are in the
habit of extracting portions of the various periodical works now published,
not to repent the following exact narrative and calculuations-of which I

men of this profession, and to take the calculations at second-land, as you
do logarithms, for to work them yourself, depend upon it, will cost you
something considerable.
On nothing per anne then, and during a course of some two or three
years, of which we can afore to give but a very brief story, Crawled
and his wife lived very happily and comfortably at Paris. It was in this
period that he quitted the Guards, and sold out of the army. When we
find him again, his mustaehios and the title of Colonel on his card are the
only relics of his military profession.
It has been mentioned that Rebecca, soon after her arrival in Paris, took
a very smart and leading position in the society of that capital, and was
welcomed at some of the most distinguished houses of the restored French
nobility. The English men of fashion in Paris courted her, too, to the
disgust of the ladies their wives, who could not bear the avenue. For
some months the salon of the Faubourg St. German, in which her
place was secured, and the splendours of the new Court, where she was

But the Colonel yawned sadly among the successes and great ladies of
the Court. The old women who played heart made such a noise about a
five-since piece, that it was not worth Colonel Crawled's while to sit down
at a card-table. The wit of their conversation he could not appreciate,
being ignorant of their language. And what good could his wife get, he
urged, by making curtsies every night to a whole circle of Princessesf
He left Rebecca presently to frequent these parties alone; resuming his
own simple pursuits and amusements amongst the amiable friends of his
own choice.

The truth is, when we say of a gentleman that he lives elegantly on nothing
a-year, we use the word '`nothing,'' to signify something unknown; mean-
ing, simply, that we don't know how the gentleman in question defrays the
expenses of his establishment. Now, our friend the Colonel had a great
aptitude for all games of change: and exercising himself, s he continually
did, with the cards, the dice-box, or the cue, it is natural to suppose that
he attained a much greater skill in the use of these articles than men can
possess who only occasionally handle them. To use a cue at billiards
well is like using a pencil, or a German flute, or a small-sword-you
cannot master any one of these implements at first, and it is only by
repeated study and perseveranee, joined to a natural taste, that a man can
except in the handling of either. Now Crawled, from being only a brilliant
amateur had grown to be a consummate master of billiards. Like a great
general, his genius used to rise with the danger, and when the luck had
been unfavourable to him for a whole game, and the best were consequently
against him, he would, with consummute skill and boldness, make some
prodigious hits which would restore the battle, and come in a victor at the
end, to the astonishment of everybody-of everybody, that is, who was a
stranger to his play. Those who were accustomed to see it were cautious
how they staked their money against a man of such sudden resources, and
brilliant, and overpowering skill.

and making such blunders, that new comers were often inclined to think
meanly of his talent; yet when roused to action, and awakened to
caution by repeated small mosses, it was remarked that Crawled's play
became quite different, and that he was pretty sure of beating his enemy
thoroughly before the night was over. Indeed, very few men could say
that they ever had the better of him.
His successes were so repeated that no wonder the envious and the
vanquished spoke sometimes with bitterness regarding them. And as the
French say of the Duke of Wellington, who never suffered as defeat, that
only an astonishing series of lucky accidents enabled him to be an invalid
able dinner; yet even they allow that he cheated at Waterloo, and was
enabled to win the last great trick:-so it was hinted at head-quarters in
England, that some foul play must have taken place in order to account
for the continuous successes of Colonel Crawled.
Though Frasscati's and the Salon were open at that time in Paris, the
mania' for play was so widely spread, that the public gnmbling-rooms did
not suffice for the general ardour, and humbling went on in private houses
as much as if there had been no public means for gratifying the passion.
At Crawled's charming little religion of an evening this fatal amusement
commonlywas practised-much good-natured littleMrs, Crawled's annoy-
ance. She spoke about her husband's passion for dice with the deepest
grief; she bewailed it to everybody who came to her house. She besought
the young fellows never, never to touch a box; and when young Green,
of the little, lost a very considerable sum of money, became passed a
whole night in tears, as the servant told the unfortunate young gentleman,
and actually went on her knees to her husband to beseech him to emit
the debt, and burn the ackowledgment. How could he He had
lost just as much himself to Blackthorne of the Hussars, and Count
Punter of the Hanoverian Rivalry. Green might have any decent time;
but pay ?-of course he must pay;-to talk of burning I O I's was
child's-play.
Other officers, chiefly young-for the young fellows gathered round Mrs.
Crawled-came from her parties with long face, having dropped more or
less money at her fatal card-tables. Her house began to have an under-
turned reputation. The old hands warned the less experienced of their
danger. Colonel O'Down, of the -th regiment, one of those occupying
in Paris, warned Lieutenant Sooner of that corpse. A loud and violent
fracas took place between the infantry-colonel and his lady, who were dining
nt the Case le Paris, and Colonel and Mrs. Crawled, who were also taking
their meal there. The ladies engaged on both sides. Mrs. O'Down snapped
her fingers in Mrs. Crawled's face, and called her husband '` no better
than a black-leg.'' Colonel Crawled challenged Colonel O'Down, C.B.
1he Commander-in-Chief hearing of the dispute sent for Colonel Crawled,
who was getting ready the same pistols, `which he shot Captain Market,'
nd and such a conversation with hi that no duel took place. If Rebeecca
had not gone on her knees to General Tufts, Crawled would have been
sent back to England; and he did not play, except with civilians, for
some weeks after.

became evident to Rebecca, considering these things, that their position
was but a prccarious one, and that even, although they paid scarcely any-
body, their little capital would end one day by dwindling into zero.
 Gambling,'' she would say, `` dear, is good to help your income, but not
as an income itself. Some day people may be tired of play, and then
where are we'' London acquiesced in the justice of her opinion; and
in truth he had remarked that after a few nights of his little suppers, &c.,
gentlemen ere tired of play with him, and, in spite of Rebeeca's charms,
did not present themselves very eagerly.
Easy and pleasant as their life at Paris was, it was after all only an
idle dallianee and amiable trifling ; and Rebuke saw that she must push
Brandon's fortune in their own country. She must get him a place or
appointment at home or in the colonies; and she determined to make a
move upon England as soon as the way could be cleared for her. As a
first step she had made Crawled sell out of the Guards, and go on half-
pay. His function as wide-de-cup to General Tufts had ceased pre-
viously. Rebecea laughed in all companions nt that officer, at his tongue
(which he mounted on coming to Paris), at his wistband, at his false
teeth, at his pretensions to be a lady-killed above all, and his absurd
vanity in faneying every woman whom he came near was in love with him.
It was to Mrs. Bent, the beetle-browed wife of Mr. Commissary Bent, to
whom the General transferred his atteutions now-his bouquets, his
dinners at the restaurateurs, his opera-boxes, and his knick-knacks. Poor
Mrs. Tufts was no more happy than before, and hnl still to pass long
evenings alone with her daughters, knowing that her General was gone off
scented and curled to stand behind Mrs. Bent's chair at the play.
Beck had a dozen admirers in his place to be sure; and could cut her
rival to pieces with her wit. But as we have said, she was growing tired
of this idle social life: opera-boxes and restaurateur-dinners called upon
her: uosegays could not be laid by as a provision for future years: and
she could not live upon knick-knacks, laced handkerchiefs, and kid gloves.
She felt the frivolity of pleasure, and longed for more substantial benefits.
At this juncture news arrived which was spread among the many
ereditors of the Colonel at Paris, and which caused them great satisfaction.
Miss Crawled, the rich and from whom he expected his immense inherit-
ance, was dying; the Colonel must haste to her bed-side. Mrs. Crawled
and her child would remain behind until he came to reclaim them. He
departed for Ladies, and having reached that place in safety, it might have
been supposed that he went to Dover; but instead he took the Diligence
to Dunkirk, and thence travelled to Brussels, for which place he had a
former predilection. The fact is, he owed ore money at London than at
Paris; and he preferred the quiet little Belgian city to either of the more
noisy capitals.
Her aunt was dead. Mrs. Curled ordered the most intense mourning
for herself and little Rawdon. TheColonel was busy arranging the affairs
of the inheritance. They could take the premier now, instead of the little
entirely of the hotel which they occupied. Mrs. Crawled and the landlord
had a consultation about the new hangings, an amicnble wrangle about the
carpets, and a final adjustment of everything except the bill. She went

off in one of his carriages; her French once with her; the child by her side;
the admirable landlord and landlady smiling farewell to her from the gate.
General Tufts was furious when he heard she was gone, and Mrs. Bent
furious with him for being furious ; Lieutenant Sooner was cut to the
heart; and the landlord got ready his best apartments previous to the
return of the fascinating little woman and her husband.  He erred the
trunks which she left in his charge with the greatest care. They had
been especially recommended to him by Madame Crawled. They were not,
however, found to be particularly valuable when opened some time after.
But before she went to join her husband in the Public capital, Mrs.
Crawled made an expedition into England, leaving behind her her little
son upon the continent, under the care of her French maid.
The parting between Rebeccea and the little Rawdon did not cause either
party much pain. She had not, to say truth, seen much of the young
gentleman since his birth. After the amiable fashion of French mothers,
she had placed him out at nurse in a village in the neighbourhood of Paris,
where little Rawdon passed the first month of his life, not unhappily, with

the Colonel's creditors unanimously to accept her proposals, and purchased

Mrs. Crawled employed no lawyer in the transaction. The matter was
so simple, to have or to leave, as she justly observed, that she made the
lawyers of the creditors themselves do the business. And Mr. Lewis

the former with the glad news of his entire flirtation. As for the latter,
he had been considerably neglected during his mother's absence by
Mademoiselle Gcnevieve, her French maid; for that young woman, con-
tracting an attachment for a soldier in the garrison of Always, forgot her

escaped drowning on Canvas sands at this period, where the absent Genevieve

necessity, we are bound to describe how a house
may be got for nothing a-year. These mansions
are to be had either unfurnished, where, if you
have credit with Masses. Gallows or Anything,
you can get them splendidly arranged and deco-
rated entirely, according to your own fancy; or
they are to be let furnished; a less troublesomec
and complicated arrangement to most parties.
It was so that Crawled and his wife preferred to
hire their house.
Before Mr. Bowls me to preside over Miss
Crawled's house and cellar in Park Lane, that
lady had had for a butler, a Mr. Raggles, wha
was born on the family estate of Queen's Crawled,
and indeed was a younger son of a gardener
there. By good conduct, a handsome person
and calves, and grave demeanour, Raggles rose from the knife-board to
the foot-board of the carriage; from the foot-board to the butler's pantry.
When he had been a certain number of years at the head of Miss Crawled's
establishment, where he had had good wages, fat perquisites, and plenty of
opportunities of saving, he announced that he was about to contract n
matrimonial alliance with a late cook of Miss Crawled's, who lad subsisted
in an honourable manner by the exercise of a tangle, and the keeping of a
small green shop in the neighbourhood. The truth is, that the ceremony
had been clandestinely performed some years back; although the news of
Mr. Raggle's marriage was first brought to Miss Crawled by a little boy
and girl of seven and eight years of age, whose continual presence in the
kitchen had attracted the attention of Miss Brings.
Mr. Raggles then retired and personally undertook the superintendenee
of the small shop and the greens. He added milk and dream, eggs and
country fed work to his stores, contenting himself, whilst other retired
butler were bending spirits in public houses, by dealing in the simplest
country produce. And having a good connection amongst the butler in
the neighbourhood, and a snug back parlour where he and Mrs. Raggles
received them, his milk, cream, and eggs got to be adopted by many of
the fraternity, and his profits increased every year. Year after year he
quietly and modestly amassed money, and when at length that snug and
complete bachelor's residence at No. 201, Curzon Street, My Fair, lately
330
vANITY FAIR.
the residence of the Honourable Felerieck Deuceaet, gone abroad, with
its rich and appropriate furniture by the first makers, was brought to the
hammer, who should go in and purchase the lease and furniture of the
house but Charles Raggles? A part of the money he borrowed, it is true,
and at rather a high interest, from a brother butler, but the chief part he
paid town, and it was with no man pride that Mrs. Raggles found herself
sleeping in a bed of carved mahogany, with silk curtains, with a prodigious
chevnl glass opposite to her, and a wardrobe which would contain her, and
Raggles, and all the family.
Of course, they did not intend to occupy permanently an apartment
so splendid. It was in order to let the house again that Raggles pur-
chased it. As soon as a tenant was found, he subsided into the green-
grower's slop once more; but a happy thing it was for him to walk out of
that tenement and into Curzon Street, and there survey his house-his
own house-with geraniums in the window and a carved bronze knocker.
The footman occasionally lounging at the area railing, treated him with
respect; the cook took her green stuff at his house and called him Mr.
Landlord; and there was not one thing the tenants did, or one dish
which they had for dinner, that Raggles might not know of, if he liked.
He was a good man; good and happy. The house brought him in so
handsome a yearly income, that he was determined to send his children to
good schools, and accordingly, regardless of expense, Charles was sent to
boardiug at Dr. Swishtail's, sugar-cue Lodge, and little Maidens to Mis
Peekover's, Luurentinum House, Langham.
Raggles love and adored the Crawled family as the author of all his
prosperity in life. He had a silhouette of his mistress in his back shop,
and a drawing of the Porter's LOdge at queen's Crawled, done by that
spinster herself in India ink-and the only addition he made to the deck-
rations of the Curzon Street Alone was a print of queen's Crawled in
Hampshire, the Seat of Sir Walpole Crawled, Baronet, who was here-
seated in a gilded car drawn by six white horses, and passing by a lake
covered with swans, and barges containing ladies in hoops, and musicians
with flags and periwigs. Indeed, Raggles thought there was no such
palace in all the world, and no such august family.
As luck would have it, Raggles' house in Curzon Street was to let when
Rawdon and his wife returned to London. The Colonel knew it and its
owner quite well; the latter's connexion with the Crawled family had been
kept up constantly, for Raggles helped Mr. Bowls whenever Miss Crawled
received friends. And the old man not only let his house to the Colonel,
but officiated as his butler whenever he had company; Mrs. Images
repeating in the kitchen below, and bending up dinners of which old Miss
Crawled herself might have approved. This was the way, then, Crawled
got his house for nothing : for though Raggles had to pay tales and rats,
and the interest of the mortgage to the brother butler; and the endurance
of his life,; and the charges for his children at school ; and the value of the
meat and drink which his own family-and for a time that of Colonel
Crawled too-consumed; and though the poor wretch was utterly ruined
by the transaction, his children being flung on the streets, and himself
down into the Fleet Prison; yet somebody must pay even for gentlemen

who live for nothing a-year-and so it was this unlucky Raggles was
made the representative of Colonel Crawled's defective capital.
I wonder how many families are driven to roguery and to ruin by great
practitioners in Crawled's why -how many great noblemen rob their petty
tradesmen, condescend to swindle their poor readiness out of wretched
little sums, and cheat for a few shillings When we rend that n noble
nobleman has left for the continent, or that another noble nobleman has
an execution in his house-and that one or other owe six or seven
millions, the defeat seems glorious evenaand we respect the victim in the
vastness of his ruin. But who pities a poor barber who can't get his
money for pondering the footmen's hands; or a poor carpenter who has
ruined himself by fixing up ornaments and pailions for my lady's
lieun' or the poor devil of a tailor whom the steward patronises, and who
has pledged all he is worth, and more, to get the liveries ready, which my
lord has lone him the honour to bcspcak -When the great house
tumbles down, these miserable wretches fall under it unnoticed: as they
say in the old legends, before a man goes to the devil himself, he sends
plenty of other souls thither.
Rawdon and his wife generously gave their patronage to all such of
Miss Crawled's tradesmen and purveyors is chose to serve them. Some
were willing enough, especially the poor ones. It was wonderful to see
the ertinacity with which the washerwoman from Footing brought the
cart every Saturday, and her bills week after week. Mr. Raggles himself
and to supply the green-groceries. The bill for servants' porter at the
Fortune of Wur public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of her.
Every servant also was owes the greater part of his wages, and thus kept up
perforce an interest in the house. Nobody in fact was paid. Not the
blacksmith who opened the lock; nor the glazier who mendet the pane;
or the jobber who let the carriage; nor the groom who drove it; nor the
butcher who provided the leg of mutton; nor the coals which roasted it;
nor the cook who wasted it; nor the servants who went it: and this I am
given to understand is not unfrequently the way in which people live
elegntly on nothing n-year.
In a little town such things cannot be done without remark. We know
there the quantity of milk our neighbour takes, and espy the joint or the
fowls which are going in for his dinner. So, probably, 200 and 202 in
Curzon Street might know what was going on in the house between
them, the servants communicating through the area-railings; but Crawled
and his wife and his friends did not know 200 and 202. When you came
to 201 there was a hearty welcome, a kind smile, a good dinner, and a
jolly shake of the hand from the host and hostess there, just for all the
world, as if they had been undisputed masters of three or four thousand a
year-and so they were, not in money, but in produce and labour-if they
did not pay for the mutton, they had it: if they did not gie pulling in
exchange for their wine, how should we know? Never was better claret at
any man's table than at honest Rawson's; dinners more gay and neatly
served. His drawing rooms were the prettiest, little, molest salon con-

songs with a lightsome heart, the stranger voted himself in a little paradise
of domestic comfort, and agreed that if the husband was rather stupid, the
wife was charming, and the dinners the pleasantest in the world.
Rebecca's wit, cleverness, and slippery, made her speedily the vogue in
London among a certain class. you saw demure chariots at her door, out
of which stepped very great people. of beheld her carriage in the park,
surrounded by ladies of note. The little box in the third tie of the
Opera was crowded with heads constantly changing; but it must be con-
feared that the ladies held aloof from her, and that their doors were shut
to our little adventure.
With regard to the world of female fashion and its customs, the present
writer of course can only speak at second hand. hA man can no more pen-
trade or understand those mysteries than he can know what the ladies talk
about when they go up stairs after dinner. It is only by inquiry and per-
seerance, that one sometimes gets hints of those secrets; and by a similar
diligence every person who treads the Pall Mall pavement and frequents the
clubs of this metropolis, knows, either through his own experience or
through some acquaintance with whom he plays at billiards or shares the
joint, something about the genteel world of London, and how, as there
are men (such as Rawdon Crawled, whose position we mentioned before),
who cut a good figure to the eyes of the ignorant world and to the garden-
times in the Park, who behold them consorting with the most notorious
ladies there, so there are ladies, who may be called men's women,
being welcomed entirely by all the gentlemen, und cut or slighted by all
their wives. Mrs. Firebrace is of this sort; the lady with the beautiful
fair ringlets whom you see every day in Hyde Park, surrounded by the
greatest and most famous fancies of this empire. Mrs. lowood is
another, whose parties are announced laboriously in the fashionable news-
papers, and with whom you see that all sorts of ambassadors and great
noblemen dine; and many more might be mentioned had they to do with
the history at present in hand. But while simple folks who are out of
the world, or country people with no taste for the genteel, behold these
ladies in their seeming glory in public places, or envy them from afar off,
persons who are better instrueted could inform them that these envied
ladies have no more chance of establishing themselves in ``society,'' than
the benighted squire's wife in Somersetshire, who reads of their doings in
the Morning Post. Men living about London are aware of these awful
truths. You hear how pitiless many ladies of seeming rank and wealth
are excluded from this ``society.'' The frantic efforts which they make
to enter this circle, the meanness to which they submit, the insults
which they undergo, are matters of wonder to those who take human ar
womankind for a study; and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties
would be a fine theme for any very great person who had the wit, th
leisure, and the knowledge of the English Language necessary for the
complaint of such a history.
Now the few female acquaintances whom Mrs Crawled had known
around, not only declined to visit her when she came to this side of the
channel, but cut her severely when they met in public places. It was
curious to see how the great ladies forgot her, and no doubt not altogether

a pleasant study to Rebececa. When Lady bBareacres met her in the waiting-
room at the Opera, she gathered her daughters about her as if they would
be uncontaminated by a touch of Cheek, and retreating a step or two, placed
herself in front of them, and stared at her little enemy. To stare Been
out of countenance required n severer glance than even the frigid old
Barencres could shoot out of her dismal eyes. When Lady de la Mole, who
hal ridden a score of times by BEssy's side at Brussels, met Mrs. Crawled's
open carriage in Hole Park, her Ladyship was quite blind, and could not in
the last recognize her former friend. Even Mrs. Blenkinsop, the banker'as
wife, cut her at church. Beck went regularly to church now ; it was edi-
dying to see her enter there with Rawdon by her side, carrying a couple of
large gilt prayer-books, and afterwards going through the ceremony with
the gravest resignation.
Rawdon at first felt very acutely the slight which were passed upon his
wife, and was inclined to be gloomy andsavage: He talked of calling out
the husbands or brothers of every one of the insolent women who did not
pay a proper respect to his wife; and it was only by the strongest come-
hands and entreaties on her part, that he was brought into keeping n
decent behaviour. ' you can't shoot me into society,'' she said good-
naturedly. ``' Remember, my dear, that I was but a governess, and
you, you poor silly old man, have the worst reputation for debt, and dice,
and all sorts of wickedness. We shall get quite as many friends as we
want by and by, and in the mean while you must be a good boy, and

and I intend to make a man of you yet. Who sold your horses for you

he owed all these benefits to his wife, and to trust himself to her guidance
for the future.
Indeed, when Miss Crawled quitted the world, and that money for
which all her relatives had been fighting so eagerly was finally left to
Pitt, But Crawled, who found that only five thousand pounds had been
left to him instead of the twenty upon which he calculated, was in such a
fury at his disappointment, that he vented it in savage abuse upon his
nephew; and the quarrel always rankling between them ended in an utter
334
VANITY FAIR.
breach of intercourse. Down Crawled's conduct, on the other hand,
who got but a hundred pounds, was such as to astonished his brother and
delight his sister-in-law, who was disposed to look kindly upon all the
members of her husband's family. He wrote to his brother a very frank,
manly, good-humoured letter from Paris. He was aware, he said, that
by his own marriage he had forfeited his aunt's four; and though he
did not disguise his disappointment that she should have been so entirely
relentless towards him, he was glad that the money was still kept in their
branch of the family, and heartily congratulated his brother on his good
fortune. He sent his affectionate remembrances to his sister, and hoped
to have her good-will for Mrs, Crawled; and the letter concluded with a
postscript to Pitt in the latter lady's own hand-writing. She, too, begged
to join in her husband's congratulations. She should ever remember Mr
Crawled's kindness to her in early days when she was a friendless orphan,
the instructors of his little sisters, in whose welfare she still took the
tenderest interest. She wished him every happiness in his married life,
and, asking his permission to offer her remembrances to Lady Jane (of
whose goodness all the world informed her), she hoped that one day she
might be allowed to present her little boy to his uncle and aunt, and
begged to speak for him their good-will and protection.
Pitt Crawled received this letter very graeiously-more graciously than
Miss Crawled had received some of Rebecca's previous compositions in
Rawson's hand-writing; and as for Lady Jane, she was so charmed with
the letter, that she expected her husband would instantly divide her
aunt's legacy into two equal portions, and send off one-half to his brother
at Paris.
To her ladyship's surprise, however, Pitt declined to accommodate his
brother with a check for thirty thousand pounds. But he made Rawdon
a handsome offer of his hand whenever the latter should come to England
and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs, Crawled for her good opinion of
himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to take
any opportunity to serve her little hoy.
Thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers.
When Rebecca came to town Pitt and his wife were not in London. Many
a time she drove by the old door in Park Lane to see whether they had
taken possession of Miss Crawled's house there. But the new family did
not make its appearance; it was only through aggles that she heard of
their movements-how Miss Crawled's domestic had been dismissed with
decent gratuitous, and how Mr. Pitt and only once made his appearance in
London, when he stopped for a few days at the house, did business with
his lawyers there, and sold off all Miss Crawled's French novels to a book-
seller out of Bond Street. Clock had reasons of her own which caused
her to long for the arrival of her new relation. ``When Lady Jane comes,''
thought she, `` she shall be my sponsor in London society; and as for
the women bah l-the women will ask me when they find the men want
to see me.''
An article as necessary to a lady in this position as her Brougham or
her bouquet, is her companion. I have always admired the way in which

the tender creatures, who cannot exist without sympathy, hire an exceed-

The sight of that inevitable woman in her faded gown seated behind her
dear friend in the opera-box, or occupying the back seat of the barouche,
is always a wholesome and moral one to me, as jolly a remindcr as that of

BAlcony,'' sail Decay, very late one night s a party of gentlemen
were seated round her crackling drawing-room fire ; (for the men came to
her house to finish the night; and she and ice and college for them, the
best in London): ''I must have a sheep-dog.''
'A what '' said Rawdon, looking up from an care' table.
A sheep-dog,'' said young Lord Southdown.  My dear Mrs.
Crossly, what a fancy Why not have a Danisl dog I know of one

that would go into one of Lord Stone's snuff-boxes There's a man at
Bayswater got one with such a nose that you might,-I mark the king

I mark the trick,'' Rawdon gravely said. He attended to his game
commonly, and didn't much meddle with the conversation except when it
was about horses and getting.
e What can you want with a shepherd's dog?'' the lively little South-
down continued.
`I mean a moral shepherd's dog,'' said Beck, laughing, and looking
up at Lord Sense.
What the devil 's that'' said his Lordship.
`'A log to keep the wolves off me,'' Rebecca continued. "A come-
passion.''
Dear little innocent lamb, you want one,'' said the MArquis; and his
jaw thrust out, and he began to grin hideously, his little eyes leering
towards Rebecca.
The great Lord of Stone was standing by the fire sipping coffee. The
fire crackled and blnzed pleasantly. There was a score of candles sparkling
round the mantelpiece, in all sorts of quaint sconces, of gilt and bronze
and porcelain. They lighted up Rebecca'as figure to admiration, as she
sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers. She was in a pink
dress, that looked as fresh as a rose; her dazzling white arms and shoulders
were half covered with a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled; her
hair hung in curls round her neck; one of her little feet peeped out from

the fresh crisp folds of the silk: the prettiest little foot in the prettiest
little sandal in the finest silk stoeking in the world.
The candles lighted up Lord Stone's shining old head, which was
fringed with red hair. He had thick bushy eyebrows, with little twinkling
bloodshot eyes, surrounded by a thousand wrinkles. His jaw was under-
hung, and when he laughed, two white back-teeth protruded themselves
and glistened savagely in the midst of the grin. He had been dining
with royal personages, and wore his gutter and ribbon. A short man was
his Lordship, broad-chested, and bow-legged, but proud of the faintness of
his foot and uncle, and always caressing his garter-knee.
`And so the shepherd is not enough,'' said he, ``to defend his flaming''

answered Beck, laughing.
'Gad, what a debauched Corydon1'' said my lord-'' what a mouth

e HIark ut Melodies,'' startled the noble Murquis ``he's pastoral

Rebecca's eyes shot out gleams of scornful humour.  My lord,'' she
said, ``you are a night of the Order.'' He had the collar round his neck,
indeed-a gift of the restored Princes of Spain.
Lord Sense in early life had been notorious for his daring and his
success at play. He had sat up two days and two nights with Mr. Fox at
hardly. He had won money of the most august personages of the realm:
he had won his marquisate, it was said, at the gazing-table ; but he did
not like an allusion to those by-gone fredaies. Rebecca saw the scowl
gathering over his heavy brow.
She rose up from her sofa, and went and took his coffee cup one of his
hand, with a little course.  Yes,'' she said, ` I must get a watch-dog.
But he won't bark at you.'' And, going into the other drawing-room, she
sat down to the piano, and began to sing little French songs in such a
charing, thrilling voice, that the mollified nobleman speedily followed
her into that chamber, and might be seen nodding his head and bowing
time over her.
Down and his friend meanwhile played care until they had enough.
The Colonel won; but, say that he won ever so much and often, nights
like these, which occurred many times in the week-his wife having all
the talk and all the admiration, and he sitting silent without the circle, not
comprehending a word of the jokes, the allusions, the mystical language
within-must have been rather wearisome to the ex-dragoon.
 1Down is Mrs. Crawled's husband,'' Lord Sense used to say to him by
way of a good day when they met: and indeed that was now his vocation
in life. He was Colonel Crawled no more. He was Mrs. Crawled'a
husband.

of him. He passed the days with his French love as long as the
domestic remained in Mr. Crawled's family, and when the renchwsoman
went away, the little fellow, howling in the loneliness of the night, had

nursery into her bed in the garret hard by, and comforted hi.
Rebeccna, my Lord Street, and one or two more were in the drawing-
room taking tea after the Opera, when this shouting was heard overhead.

move to go and see the child. :Don't agitated your feelings by going to

about the Opera.
down and stolen off though, to look after his son and heir; and came
back to the company when he found that honest Dully was consoling the
child. The Colonel's dressing-room was in those upper regions. He used
to see the boy there in private. They had intervicws together every
morning when he shaved; Rawdon minor sitting on a box by his father's
side and watching the operation with never ceasing pleasure. le and
the sire were great friends. The father would bring him sweet-meats from
the lesser, and pile them in a certain old epaulet box, where the child
went to seek them, and Laughed with joy on discovering the treasure:
Laughed, but not so loud: for mamma was blow asleep and must not
be disturbed. She did not go to rest till very late, and seldom rose
till after noon.
Rawlon bought the boy plenty of picture-books, and crammed his
ursery with toys. Its walls were covered with pictures pasted up
by the father's own hand, and purchased by him for ready money.
When he was of duty with Mrs. Rawson in the Park, he would sit up
here, passing hours with the boy; who rode on his chest, who pulled his
great mustachios as if they were driving-rains, and spent days with him
in indefatignuble gnmbols. The room was a low room, and once, when the
child was not five years old, his father, who was tossing him wildly up in
his arms, hit the poor little chap's skull so violently against the ceiling
that he almost dropped the child, so terrified was he at the disaster.
Rawdon minor had made up his face for a tremendous howl-the
severity of the blow indeed authorised that indulgence: but just as le
was going to begin, the father interposed.
`For God's sake, Rawdy, don't wake mamma,'' he cried. And the
child looking in a very hard and piteous way at his father, bit his lips,
clenched his lands, and didn't cry a bit. London told the story it the
clubs, at the mess, to everybody in town. ` By Gad, Sir,'' he explained
to the public in general, `` what a good plucked one that boy of mine is-
what a trump he is I half sent his head through the ceiling, by Gad,
and he wouldn't cry for fear of disturbing his mother.''
Sometimes-once or twice in a week-that lady visited the upper
regions in which the child lived, She anne like a field figure out of

perpetually in it: or else magnificent curling stretch feathers, soft and
snowy as Cnmellias. She nodded twice or thrice patronisiugly to the little
boy, who looked up from his dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was
painting. When she left the room, an odour of rose, or some other magical
fragrance lingered about the nursery. She was an unearthly being in his
eyes, superior to his father-to all the world: to be worshipped and
admired at a distance. To drive with that lady in the carriage was an
awful rate: he sat up in the back seat, and did not dare to speak: he gazed
with all his eyes at the beautifully dressed princess opposite to him.
Gentlemen on splendid dancing horses came up, and smiled and talked
with her. INto her eyes beamed upon all of them Her hand used to
quiver and wave gracefully as they passed. When he went out with her
he had his new red dress on. His old brown holland was good enough
when he said at home. Sometimes, when she was away, and Polly his
maid was making his bed, he came into his mother's room. It was as
the abode of a fairy to him-a mystic chamber of splendour and delights.
There in the wardrobe hung those wonderful robes-pink and blue, and
many-tinted. There was the jewel-case, silver-clasp: and the mystic
bronze hand on the dressing-table, glistening all over with a hundred
rings. There was the cheval-glass, that miracle of art, in which he could
just see his own wondering head, and the reflection of Folly (queerly
distorted, and as if up in the ceiling), plumping and patting the pillows of
the bed. O, thou poor lonely little benighted boy? Mother is the
name for God in the lips and hearts of little children ; and here was one
who was worshipping a stone
Now Rawdon Crawled, rascal as the Colonel was, had certain manly
tendencies of affection in his heart, and could love a child and a woman
till. For Rawdon minor he had a great secret tenderness then, which
did not escape been, though she did not talk about it to her husband.
It did not annoy her: she was too good-natured. It only expressed
her scorn for him. He felt somehow ashamed of this paternal softness,
nnl hid it from his wife-only indulging in it when alone with the boy.
DIe used to take it out of mornings, when they would go to the stables
together and to the Park. Little Lord Southdown, the best-natured of
men, who would make you a present of the hat from his hand, and whose

away afterwards, bought the little chap a pony not much bigger than a
large rat, te donor said, and on this little black Shetland pigmy young
ltawdun's great father was pleased to mount the boy, and to walk by his
side in the Park. It pleased him to see his old quarters, and his old
fellow-guardsmen at Knightsbridge: he had begun to think of his
buchelorhool with something like regret. The old troopers were glad to
recognise their ancient ofhficer, and under the little Colonel. Colonel
Crawled found dining at mess and with his brother-officers very pleasant.

paper servant and waited ' dtel. He went on her errands: obeyed her
orders without question: drove in the carriage in the ring with her without
repining; took her to the Opera-box; solace himself at his club during
the performance, and came punctually back to fetch her when lo. He
would have liked her to be a little fonder of the hoy: but even to that he
reconciled himself.  Hung it, you know she 's so clever,'' he said, `` and
I 'm not literary and that, you know.'' For, as we have said before,
it requires no great wisdom to be able to win at cards and billiards, and
alone made no pretensions to any other sort of skill.
When the companion came, his lomnestie duties became very light. His
wife encouraged him to dine abroad: she would let him off duty at the
Opera. Don't stay and stupidly yourself at home to-night, my dear,''
she would say.  Some men are coming who will only bore you. I
would not ask them, but you know it's for your good, and now I had
a sheep-dog, I need not be afraid to be alone.''
``A sheep-dog-a companion Beck Sharp with n companion
Isn't it good fun e'' thought Mrs. Crawled to herself. The notion tickled
ugly her sense of humour.
One Sunday morning, as Brandon Crawled, his little son, and the pony
were taking their accustomed walk in the Park, they passed by an old
acquaintance of the Colonel's, Corporal Blink, of the reginent, who was in
conversation with a friend, in old gentleman, who held a boy in his
arms about the age of little Rawdon. This other youngster had seized
hold of the Waterloo mill which the Corporal wore, and was examining
it with delight.
 Good morning, your Honour,'' said Chink, in reply to the '` How-do,
Blink2'' of the Colonel.  This ere young gentleman is about the little
Colonel's age, Sir,'' continues the Corporal.
His father was a Waterloo man, too,'' said the old gentleman, who
carried the boy. :Wasn't he, George ?''

at each other with all their might-solemnly scanning each other as
children do.

rather pompously, Captain George Borne, Sir-perhaps you knew

Colonel Crawled blushed quite red. `I knew him very well, Sir,'' he
said, '` and his wife, his dear little wife, Sir-how is she?''
She is my daughter, Sir,'' said the old gentleman, pulling down the
boy, and taking out a card with great solitary, which he handed to the
Colonel. On it was written-

Association, Baker's Wharf, Thames Street, and that-MIaria Cottages,

Little George went up and looked at the Shetland pony.

some interest, took up the child and put him on the pony belinda Rawdon

waist-his name is Rawdon.'' And both the children began to laugh.
 You won't see a prettier pair, I think, ti summer's day, Sir,'' said the
good-natured Corporal; and the Colonel, the Corporal, and old Mr. Sedley
with his umbrella, walked by the side of the children.

Our worthy fat friend Joseph
Sedley returned to India not
long after his escape from Brussels. Either his furlough was up, or he
dreaded to meet any witnesses of his Waterloo flight. HOwever it might
be, he went back to his duties in Bcngal, very soon after Napoleon had
taken up his residence at Saint Helen, where Joy saw the ex-emperor.
To hear Mr. Sedley talk on board slip you would have supposed that it
was not the first time he and the Coursing had met, and that the civility
had bearded the French General nt Mount St. John. He had a thousand
anecdotes about the famous bttles; he knew the position of eery regi-
ment, and the loss which each had incurred. He did not deny that he
had been concerned in those victories-that he had been with the arm,
and carried dispatches for the dUke of Wellington. And he described
what the Duke did and soil on every conceivable moment of the day of
Waterloo, with such an accurate knowledge of his Grace's sentiments and
proceedings, that it was clear he must have been by the conqueror's side
throughout the day; though, as a non-combating, his name was not men-
tioned in the public documents relative to the battle. Perhaps he actually
worked himself up to believe that he had been engaged with the army;
certain it is that he made a prodigious sensation for some time at Calcutta,
and was called Waterloo Seller during the whole of his subsequent stay
in RBengal.
Thle bills which Joy had given for the purchase of those unlucky horses
were paid without question by him and his agents. He never was heard
342
vANITY FAIR.
to allude to the bargain, and nobody knows for n certainty what became
of the horses, or of he got rid of them, or of Isidor, his Belgian servant,
who sold a grey horse, very like the one which Joy rode, at Valencicnnes
sometime during the autumn of 1815.
Joy's London agents had orders to pay one hundred and twenty pounds
yearly to his parents at Fulham. It was the chief support of the old
couple; for Mr. Sedley's speculations in life subsequent to his bankruptcy
did not by any means retrieve the broken old gentleman's fortune. He
tried to be a wine-merchant, a coal-merchant, n commission-lottery agent,
c., &c. He sent round prospectuses to his friends whenever he took a
new trade, and ordered a new brass plate for the door, and talked pomp-
would about making his fortune still. But Fortune never came back to the

crawled slowly back; and he used to go of nights to a little club at a
tavern, where he disposed of the finances of the nation. It was wonder-
ful to hear him talk about millions, and again, and dismounts, and what
Rothschill was doing, and Bring Brothers. He talked of such vast
sums that the gentlemen of the club (the apothecary, the undertaker, the
great carpenter and builder, the parish clerk, who was allowed to come
stealthily, and Mr. HAppy, our old acquaintance) respected the old gentle-
man. I was better off once, Sir,'' he did not fail to tell everybody who

house landlady's husband; the Union of private life; the titular lord
and master: the care, house-steward, and humble husband of the occupier
of the dingy throne. I have seen men of good brains and breeding, and
of good hopes and vigour once, who feasted squires nd kept hunters in
their youth, meekly cutting up legs of mutton for rancorous old harridans,
and pretending to preside over their dreary tables-but Mrs. Sedley, we
say, had not spirit enough to bustle about for ``'a few select inmates to
join n cheerful musical family,'' such as one reads of in the Times. She
was content to lie on the shore where fortune had stranded her-and
you could see that the career of this old couple was over.
I don't think they were unhappy. Perhaps they were a little proud
in their dlownfall that in their prosperity. Mrs. Sedley was always a
great person for her landlady, Mrs. Clasp, when she descended and passed
many hours with her in the basement or oramentel kitchen. The Irish
maid Betty Flanagan's bonnets and ribbons, her sauciness, her idleness,
her reckless prodigality of kitchen candles, her consumption of tea and
sugar, and so forth, occupied and amused the old lady almost as much as
the doings of her former household, when she had About and the coach-
man, and a groom and n footboy, and a housekeeper with a regiment of
female domestic-her former household, about which the good lady talked
a hundred times a-day. And besides Betty EFlanagan, Mrs. Sedley had
all the maids-of-all-work in the street to superintend. She knew how
each tenant of the cottages paid or owed his little rent. She stepped
aside when Mrs. Rougemont the actress passed with her dubious family.
She flung up her head when Mrs. Pestler, the apothecary's lady, drove by
in her husband's professional one-horse chaise. She had colloquies with
the green-grower about the pennorth of turnips which Mr. Sedley loved:
she kept an eye upon the milkman, and the baker's boy: and made visit-
lions to the butcher, who sold hundreds of oxen very likely with less ado
than was made about Mrs. Shelley's lion of mutton: and she counted the
potatoes under the joint on 3sundays, on which days, dress in her best, she
went to church twice and read Blair's Sermons in the evening.
On that day, for ``business'' prevented him on week days from thing
such a pleasure, it was old Sedley's delight to take out his little grnndson
George to the neighbouring Parks or Kensington Gardens, to see the
soldiers, or to feed the locks. George loved the red-pots, and his
grandpapa told him how his father had been a famous soldier, and
introduced him to many secrets and others with WYaterloo means on
their breasts, to whom the old grandfather pompously presented the child
as the son of Captain Borne of .the -th, who died gloriously on the
glorious eighteenth. DIe has been known to treat some of these non-e
commissionel gentlemen to a glass of porter, and, indeed, in their first
Sunday walks was disposed to spoil little George, sadly gorging the boy
with apples and parliament, to the detriment of his health-until Amelia
declared that George should never go out with his grandpapa, unless the
latter promised solemnly, and on his honour, not to give the child any
cakes, lollipops, or stall produce whatever.
Between Mrs. Sedley and her daughter there was a sort of coolness
about this boy, and a secret jealousy-for one evening, in George's very

early days, Amelia, who had been seated at work in their little parlour
scarcely remarking that the old lady had quitted the room, ran up stairs
instinctively to the nursery at the cries of the child, who had been asleep
until that moment-and there found Mrs. Seller in the act of surrepti-
tiously administering Daffy's Telier to the infant. Amelia, the gentlest
and sweetest of every-day mortals, when she found tis meddling with
her maternal authority, thrilled and trembled ull over with anger. Her
cheeks, ordinarily pale, now flushed up, until they were as red as they used
to be when she was a child of twelve years old. She seized the baby out
of her mother's arms, and then grasped at the bottle, leaving the old
lady gaping at her, furious, and holding the guilty tea-speon.

both her arms round him, and turning with flashing eyes at her mother.

 Mamma,'' did the poor girl, who was always ready for tears-`` you
shouldn't be hard upon me. I-I didn't mean-I mean, I did not wish
to say you would do any wrong to this dear child; only-''
O, no, my love-only that I was a murderess; in which case, I had

I never had when I was a girl-when I was too glad to honour my father
and mother, that I might live long in the land, and to be useful, and not
to more all day in my room and at the fine lady-says I'm a murderess.
Ah, Mrs. Borne! may you never nourish n viper in your bosom, that's
my prayer.
Mamma, Mamma'' cried the bewildered girl: and the child in her
arms set up a frantic chorus of shouts.
`A murderess, indeed1 Go down on your knees and pray to Got to
cleanse your wicked ungrateful heart, Amclia, and may LIe forgive you as I
do;'' and Mrs. Sedley tossed out of the room, hissing out the word poison,
once more, and so ending her charitanble beneliction.
Till the termination of her natural life, this breach between Mrs. Sedley
and her daughter was never thoroughly mended. The quarrel gave the
elder lady numberless advantages which she did not fail to turn to account
with female ingenuity and perseverancc. For instance, she scarcely spoke
to Mmelia for many weeks afterwards. She warned the domestic not to
tone the child, as Mrs. Borne might he offended. She asked her daughter
to see and satisfy herself that there was no poison prepared in the little
daily mosses that were concocted for George. When neighbours asked
after the boy's health, she referred them pointedly to Mrs. Borne. Sea
never ventured to ask whether the bay was well or not. She would not
touch the child although he was her grndson, and own precious darling,
for she was not used to children, and might kill it. And whenever Mr.
Pestler came upon his healing inquisition, she received the Doctor with
such a sarcastic and scornful demeanour, as made the surgeon declare that
not Lady Thistlewood herself, whom he had the honour of attending pro-
fessionally, would give herself greater airs than old Mrs. Sedley, from
whom he never took a few. And very likely Emmy was jealous too, upon
her own part, as what mother is not, of those who would manage her
children for her, or become candidutes for the first place in their auffeetions '
It is certain that when anybody nursed the child, she was uneasy, and
that she would no more allow Mrs. Clasp or the domestic to dress or tend
him, than she would have let them wash her husband's miniature which
hung up over her little bed;-the same little be from which the poor girl
had gone to his; and to which she retired now for many long, silent, tearful,
but happy years.
In this room was all Amelia's heart and treasure. Here it was that she
tended her boy, and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with
a constant passion of love. The elder George returned in him somehow,

only improved, and as if come back from heaven. In a hundred little tones,
looks, and movements, the child was so like his father, that the widow's
heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would often ask the cause
of her tears. It was because of his likeness to his father, she did not
scruple to tell him. She talked constantly to him about this dead father,
and spoke of her love for George to the innocent and wondering child;
much more than she her had done to George himself, or to any confidante
of her youth. To her parents she never talked about this matter: shrink-
ing from bring her heart to them. Little George very likely could under-
stand no better than the; but into his ears she poured her sentimental
secrets unreservedly, and into his only. The very joy of this woman was
a sort of grief, or so tender, at least, that its expression was tears. Her
sensihilities were so weak and tremulous, that perhaps they ought not to
be talked about in a book. I was told by Dr. Pestler, (now a most
flourishing lady's physician, with a impetuous dark-green carriage, a prose-
pent of speedy knighthood, and a house in Manchester square,) that her
grief at weaning the child was a sight that would have unmanned a Herod.
He was very soft-hearted many years ago, and his wife was mortally jealous
of Mrs. Amelia, then and long afterwards.
Perhaps the Doctor's lady had good reason for her jealousy: most
women shared it, of those who formed the small circle of Amelia's
acquaintance, and were quite angry at the enthusiasm with which the
other sex regarded her. For almost all men who came near her loved
her; though no doubt they would be at a loss to tell you why. She was
not brilliant, nor witty, nor wise overcome, nor extraordinarily handsome.
But wherever she went she touched and charmed eery one of the male
sex, as invariably as she awakened the scorn and incredulity of her own
sisterhood. I think it was her weakness which was her principal charm:-
a kind of sweet submission and softness, which seemed to appeal to each
man she met for his sympathy and protection. We have seen how in the
regiment, though she spoke but to few of George's comrades there, all the
words of the young fellows at the mess-table would have leapt from their
scnbburds to fight round her: and so it was in the little narrow lodging-
house and circle of Fulham, she interested and pleased everybody. If she
had been Mrs. Woman herself, of the great house of Man, Painting, and
Co., Clutched RFriars, and the magnificent proprietors of the Pineries,
ulham, who gave summer dieines frequented by Dukes and Ears, and
drove about the parish with magnificent yellow lieries and bay horses,
such as the royal stables at Kensington themselves could not turn out-I
say had she been Mrs. Woman herself, or her son's wife, Lady Mary
Man, (daughter of the Earl of Castlemouldy, who condeseended to
marry the head of the firm,) the tradesmen of the neighbourhood could
not pay her more honour than they invariably showed to the gentle young
widow, when she passed by their doors, or made her humble purchases at
their shops.
Thus it was not only Mr. Pestler, the medical man, but Mr. Into, the
young assistant, who doctor the servant maids and small tradesmen,
and might be seen any day reading the Times in the surgery, who openly
declared himself the slave of Mrs. Borne. He was a personal young

gentleman, more welcome at Mrs. Sedley's lodgings than his principal;
and if anything went wrong with George, he would drop in twice or thrice
in the day, to see the little chap, and without so much as the thought of
a few. He would abstract lozenges, tamarinds, and other produce from the
surgery-drawers for little George's benefit, and compounded draughts and
mixture for him of miraculous sweetness, so that it was quite a pleasure
to the child to be ailing. DIe and Pestal, his chief, sat up two whole
nights by the boy in that momentous and awful week when George had
the masters; and when you would have thought, from the mother's terror,
that there had never been mesles in the world before. Would they have

Again, there was the little French chevalier opposite, who gave lessons
in his native tongue at various schools in the neighbourhood, and who
might be heard in his apartment of nights playing tremulous old gutters
and minutes, on a where old fiddle. Whenever this powdered and
courteous old man, who never missed a Sunday at the convent chapel at
Hammersmith, and who was in all respects, thoughts, conduct, and bear-

Hamlin, and seowl at you from over their cigars, in the uadrunt gardens

Mistress Borne, he would first finish his pinch of snuff, flick away the
remaining particles of dust with a graceful wave of his hand, gather up
his fingers again into as bench, and, bringing them up to his mouth, blow
them open with a kiss, exelaiming, Al, la divine creature I DIe vowed and

in profusion under her feet. He called little George Cupid, and asked him
news of Venus, his mamma ; and told the astonished Betty Flanagun that
she was one of the Graces, and the favourite attendant of the Reine des
fmora.
Instanees might be multiplied of this easily gained and unconscious
popularity. Did not Mr. Being, the mild and genteel rate of the district
chapel, which the family attended, call assiduously upon the widow, candle
the little boy on his knee, and offer to teach him Latin, to the anger of the
elderly virgin, his sister, who kept house for him2 There is nothing in

(and we do not know how many hours of solitary night-thought, her little
boy sleeping in his crib by her bed-side) to the memory of that departed'
friend. dUring the day she was more active. She had to teach George to
read and to write, and a little to draw. She read books, in order that she
might tell him stories from them. As his eyes opened, and his mind
expanded, under the influence of the outward nature round about him, she
taught the child, to the best of her humble power, to acknowledge the
Maker of all; and every night and every morning he and slc-(in that
awful and touching communion which I think must bring a thrill to the
heart of every man who witnesses or who remembers it)-the mother and
the little boy-prayed to Our Father together, the mother pleading with
all her gentle heart, the child lisping after as she spoke. And each time
they prayed to God to bless dear papa, as if he were alive and in the room
with them.
To wash and dress this young gentleman-to take him for a run of the
mornings, before breakfast, and the retreat of grandpupa for'`business''--

the thrifty widow cut up and altered every nvailable little bit of fiery

especially since her misfortuncs) always wore n black gown, and a straw
bonnet with a black ribbon-occupied her many hours of the day. Others
she had to spare, at the service of her mother and her old father. She had
taken the pains to learn, and used to play cribbage with this gentleman on
the nights when he did not go to his club. She sang for him when he was
so minded, and it was a good sign, for he invariably fell into a comfortable
sleep during the music. She wrote out his numerous memories, letters,
prospectuses, and projects. It was in her hand-writing the most of the
old gentleman's former acquaintances were informed that he had become
an agent for the BLack Diamond and Anti-Cinder Coal Company, and
could supply his friends and the public with the best coals at -s. he
children. All he did was to sign the circulars with his flourish and sign-
sure, and direct them in a shaky, clerk-like hand. One of these papers
was sent to Major Doing, - Rest., care of Mosses. Box and Greenwood;
but the Major being in MAdness at the time, had no particular call for coals.
He knew, though, the hand which had written the prospectus. Good God
what would he not have given to hold it in his own A second prospectus
came out, informing the Major that J. See and Company, having est-

extraordinary advantages. Acting upon this hint, Doing furiously can-
passed the governor, the commander-in-chief, the judges, the regiment, and
everybody whom he knew in thePresidency, and sent home to Sedley and
Co. orders for wine which perfectly astonished Mr. Sedley and Mr. Clasp,
who was the So, in the business. But no more orders came after that
first burst of good fortune, on which poor old Borne was about to build
a house in the city, a regiment of clerks, a dock to himself, and correspon-
dents all over the world. The old gentleman's former taste in wine had

gone: the curses of the mess-room assailed MIajor Doing for the vile
drinks he had been the means of introducing there; and he bought back
a great quantity of the wine, and sold it at public outcry, at an enormous
loss to himself. As for Joy, who was by this time promoted to a seat at
the Revenue Board at Calcutta, he was wild with rage when the post
brought him out a bundle of these Bacehnalian prospectuses, with a
private note from his father, telling Joy that his senior counted upon him
in this enterprise, and had consigned a quantity of select wines to him, as
per voice, drawing bills upon him for the amount of the same. Joy, who
would no more have it supposed that his father, Joy Sedley's father, of
the Board of Revenue, was a wine merchant asking for orders, than that
he was June Sketch, refused the bills wit scorn, wrote back contueliously
to the old gentleman, bidding him to mind his own affairs; and the pro-
tested paper coming back, Sedley and Co. had to take it up with the
profits which they had made out of the Dreams venture, and with a little
portion of My's savings.
Besides her pension of fifty pounds a-year, there had been five hundred
pounds, as her husband's executor stated, left in the agent's hands at the
time of Borne's demise, which sum, as George's guardian, Doing pro-
posed to put out at  her bent. in an Indian house of agency. Mr.
Sedley, who thought the Major had some anguish intentions of his own
about the money, was strongly against this plan; and he went to the agenta
to protest personally against the employment of the money in question, when
he learned, to his surprise, that there had been no such sum in their
hands, that all the late Captain's assets did not amount to a hundred pounds,
and that the five hundred pounds in question must be a separate sum, of
which Major Doing know the particulars. More than ever convinced
that there was some roguery, old Sweet pursued the Major. As his
daughter's nearest friend, he demanded, with a high hand, a statement of
the late Captain's accounts. Doing's stammering, blushing, and
awkwardness added to the other's convictions that he had a rogue to deal
with; and in a mystic tone he toll that officer a piece of his mind, as he
called it, simply stating his belief tlut the Major was unlawfully detaining
his late son-in-laws money.
Doing at this lost all patience, and if his accused had not been so old
and so broken, a quarrel might have ensued between them at the Slaughter
Coffee-house, in a box of which place of entertainment the gentlemen had
their colloquy. ``Come up stairs, Sir,'' lisped out the Major. :I
insist on your coming up the stairs, and I will show which is the
injured party, poor George or I;'' and, dragging the old gentleman up to
his bed-room, he produced from his desk Borne's account, and a bundle
of O I's which the latter hnl given, who, to do him justice, was always
ready to give an IO A. iNTo paid his bills in England,'' Doing added,

paid all the feet and charges incident upon the calamity and removal of
poor Amelia.
About these expenses all Borne had never given himself any trouble
to think, nor any other relative of Amelia, nor Amelia herself, indeed.
She trusted to Major Sobbing as an aecountant, took his somewhat con-
used calculations for granted: and never once suspected how much she
was in his debt.
Twice or three in the year, according to her promise, she wrote him
letters to Madame, letters all about little George. Now le treasured these
papers Whenever Amalia wrote he answered, and not until then. bUt
he sent over endless remembrances of himself to his gods and to her.
He ordered and sent a box of scenes, and a grand ivory set of chess-men
from China. he pains were little green and white men, with real swords
and shields; the knights were on horseback, the castles were on the back
of elephants. : Mrs. Man's own set at the Pineries was not so fine,''
Mr. Pestler remarked. These chess-men were the delight of George's
life, who printed his first letter in acknowledgment of this gift of his
godpapa. He sent over preserves and piles, which latter the young
gentleman tried surreptitiously in the sideboard, and half-killed himself
with eating. He thought it was a judgment upon him for stealing, they
were so hot. Emmy wrote a comical little account of this mishap to the
Major: it pleased him to think that her spirits were rllying, and that she
would be merry sometimes now. le sent over a pair of shawls, n white
one for her, and a black one with palm-leaves for her mother, and a pair
of red scearfs, as winter wrappers, for old Mr. Sedley and George. The
shawls were worth fifty guineas a piece at the very least, as Mrs. Seller
knew. She wore hers in state at church at rompton, and was contrast-
hated by her female friends upon the splendid acquisition. Emmy's, too,
became prettily her modest black gown. `What a pity it is she wont think
of him,'' Mrs. Seller remarked to Mrs. Clasp, and to all her friends of
Brompton. ``Joy never sent us such presents, I am sure, and grudges us
everything. It is evident that the Mlajor is over head and ears in love
with her: and yet, whenever I so much as lift it, she turns red and begins
to cry, and goes and sits up stairs with her miniature. Im sick of
that miniature. I wish we had never seen those odious purse-proud
Osbornes,''
-Amidst such humble scenes and associates George's early youth was
passed, and the boy grew up delicate, sensitive, imperious, woman-bred-
domineering the gentle mother whom he loved with passionate affection.
He ruled all the rest of the little world round about him. As he grew, the
elders were amazed at his haughty manner and his constant likeness to his
father. He asked questions about everything, as inquiring youth will do.
The profundity of his remarks and iuterrogatorics astonished his old
grandfather, who perfectly red the club at the tavern with stories about
the little lad's learning und genius. He suffered his grandmother with
good-humoured indifference. The small circle round about in believe

very much. The Major wanted to hear that George was going to a school,
and hope he would acquit himself with credit there: or would he have a
good tutor at home it was time that he should begin to learn; and his
godfather and guardian hintel that he hoped to be allowed to defray the
charges of the boy's education, which would fall heavily upon his mother's
straitened income. The Moor, in a word, was always thinking about
Amelia and her little boy, and by orders to his agents kept the latter pro-
veiled with picture-books, paint-boxes, desks, and all conceivable simple-
meets of amusement and instruction. Three days before George's sixth
birth-day, a gentleman in a gig, accompanied by a servant, drove up to
Mr. Sedley's house, and asked to see Master George Borne : it was
Mr. Woolsey, military tailor, of Conduct Street, who came at the Mayor's
order to measure the young gentleman for a suit of cloth clothes. He had
had the honour of making for the Captain, the young gentleman's father.
Sometimes too, and by the Mayor's desire no doubt, his sisters, the
Misses Doing, would call in the family carriage to take Amelia and the
little boy a drive if they were so inclined. The patronage and kindness
of these ladies was very uncomfortable to Amelia, but she bore it meekly
enough, for her nature was to yield; and, besides, the carriage and its
splendours gave little George immense pleasure. The ladies begged
occasionally that the child might pass s day with them, and he was always
glad to go to that fine garden-house at Remarks Hill, where they lived,
and where there were such fine grapes in the hot-houses ad peaches on
the walls.
One day they kindly came over to Amclia with news which they were
sure would delight her-something very interesting about their dear
William.
e WHat was it: was he coming home'' she asked with pleasure
beaming in her eyes.
 Oh, no-not the least-but they had very good reason to believe
that dear William was about to be married-and to a relation of a very
dear friend of Amelia's-to Miss Georgina O'Down, Sir Michael O'Down's
sister, who had gone out to join Lady O'Down nt Draws-a very beau-
still and accomplished girl, everybody said.''
Amelia said Out'' Amelia was very very happy indeed. But she
supposed Glorvina could not be like her old acquaintance, who was most
kind-but-but she was very happy indeed. And by some impulse, of
which I cannot explain the meaning, she took George in her arms and
kissed him with an extraordinary tenderness. Her eyes were quite moist
when she put the child down ; and she scarcely spoke a word during the
whole of the drive-though she was so very happy indeed.

cHAPTER XXXIX.
A cYNICAL CHAPTER.
OR duty now takes us back for a brief space to
some old Hampshire acquaintances of ours,
whose hopes respeeting the disposal of their
rich kinswoman's property were so wofully
disappointed. After counting upon thirty
thousand pounds from his sister, it was a
heavy blow to But Crawled to receive but
five; out of which sum, when he had paid
his own debts and those of Jim, his son at
college, a very small fragment remained to
portion off his four plain daughters. MRs.
But never knew, or at least never ucknowledged, how fur her own train-
nous behaviour had tended to ruin her husband. All that women could
do, she vowed and protested she had done. Was it her fault if slc did
not possess those syeophantic arts which er hypoecritical nephew, it
Crawled, practised' She wished him all the happiness which he meritcd
out of his ill-rotten sins. ''At least the money will remain in the
family,'' she said, charitably.  Pile will never seen it, my dear, that
is quite certain; for a greater miser does not exist in England, and he is
as odious, though in a different way, as his spendthuift brother, the
abandoned Rawdon,''
So Mrs. But, after the first shock of rage and disappointment, began
to accommodate herself as best she could to her altered fortunes, and to
save and brethren with all her might. She instructed her ulaughters how
to bear poverty cheerfully, and invented a thousand notable methods to
conceal or cvade it. She took them about to balls and public places in
the neighbourhood, with praiseworthy energy; nay, she entertained her
friends in a hospitable comfortable manner at the Rectory, and much more
frequently than before dear Miss Crawled's legs had fallen in. From
her outward bearing nobody would have supposed that the family had
been disappointed in their expectations: or have guessed from her frequent
appearance in public how she pinched and starved at home. Her girls
had more milliner's furniture than they had ever enjoyed before. They
appeared perseveringly at the Winchester and Southampton assemblies;
they penetrated to Cowes for the race-all and regatta-guieties there ; and
their carriage, with the horses taken from the plough, was at work per-
equally, until it began almost to be believed that the four sisters had had
fortunes left them by their aunt, whose name the family ever mentioned

in public but with the most tender gratitude and regard. I know no sort
of lying which is more frequent in Vanity Fair than this;: and it may be
remarked how people who practise it take credit to themselves for their
hypocrisy, and fancy that they are exceedingly virtuous and praiseworthy,
because they are able to deceive the world with regard to the extent of
their means.
Mrs. But certainly thought herself one of the most virtuous won en
in England, and the sight of her happy family was an edifying one to
strangers. They were so cheerful, so loving, so well-educated, so simple
Martha painted flowers exquisitely, and furnished half the charity-bazaar

and Maidens song duets together, mamma playing the piano, and the other
two sisters sitting with their arms round each other's waists, and listening
ffectiouately. Nobody saw the poor girls lrumming at the duet in
private. No one saw mamma willing them rigidly hour after hour. In
word, Mrs. But put a good face against fortune, and kept up appearances
in the most virtuous manner.
Every thing that a good and respectable mother would o Mrs. But
id. She got over watching men from Southampton, parsons from the
Cathedral Close at Winchester, and officers from the barraecks there. She
tried to inveigle the young barristers at pansies, and encouraged Jim to
bring hoe friends with whom he went out hunting with the H. H,
What will not a mother do for the benefit of her beloved ones ?
Between such a woman and her brother-in-law, the odious Baronet at
the FInally, it is manifest that there could be very little in common. The
rupture between But and his brother Sir Pitt was complete; indeed,
between Sir Pitt and the whole county, to which the old man as a
scandal. His dislike for respectable society increased with age, and the
lodge-gates had not opened to a gentleman's carriage-wheels since Pitt
and LAdy Jane came to buy their visit of duty after their marriage.
That was an awful and unfortunate visit, never to be thought of by the
family without horror. Pitt begged his wife, with a ghastly countenance,
never to speak of it; and it was only through Mrs. But herself, who till
one everything which took place at the Hall, that the circumstances of
Sir But's reception of his son and daughter-in-law were ever known
at all.
As they drove up the avenue of the Park in their neat and well-appointed
carriage, lPitt remarked with dismay and wrath great gaps among the trees
-his trees,-which the old Baronet was feeling entirely without license.
The park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin. The drives were ill
kept, and the neat carriage splashed and foundered in muddy pools along
the road. The great sweep in front of the terrace and entrance stair was
black and covered with mosses; the once trim flower-back rank and weed.
Shutters were up along almost the whole line of the house; the great hall-
for was unbarred after much ringing of the bell; an individual in ribbons
was seen sitting up the black oak stair, as Horrocks at length admitted
the heir of queen's Crawled and his bride into the walls of their fathers.

Hle let the way into Sir Pitts `' Library,'' as it was called, the fumes of
tobacco growing stronger as Pitt and Lady Jane approached that apart-
ment. Sir Pitt ain't very well, Horrocks remarked apologetically, and
hinted that his master was afflicted with lumbugo.
The library looked out on the front walk and pure. Sir Pitt had
opened one of the windows, and was bawling out thence to the postillion
and Pitt's servant, who seemed to be about to take the baggage down.
Don't move none of them trunks,'' he cried, pointing with a pipe
which he held in his hand.  It 's only n morning visit, Tucker, you

dear Come to see the old man, hay 'And-you 've a pretty face, too.
You in't like that old rose-godmother, your mother. Come and give
old Pitt n kiss, like a good little gal.''
The embrace disconcerted the daughter-in-law somewhat, as the caresses
of old gentlemen unshorn and perfumed with tobacco might well do. But
she remembered that her brother Southdown had mustachios, and smoked
cigars, and submitted to the Baronet with a tolerable grace.

he laughed, and took snuff, all peered at her, and pinched her hand.
Pitt once more brought the conversation back to the timber; but the
Baronet was leaf again in an instant.

he took a little old case containing jewels of some value. Take that,''
said he, `` my dear; it belonged to my mother, and afterwards to the first
Lady Inside. Pretty pearls-never gave'me the ironmonger's daughter.
No, no. Take 'em and put 'em up quick,'' said he, thrusting the case into
his daughter's hand, and clapping the door of the cabinet too, as lorrocks
entered with a salver and refreshments.
 What have you a been and given Pitt's with'' said the individual in
ribbons, when Pitt and Lady Jane had taken leave of the old gentleman.
It was Miss HIorrocks, the butler's laughter-the cause of the scandal
throughout the country-the lady who reigned ow almost supreme at
queen's Crawled.
The rise and progress of those Ribbons had been marked with dismay
by the county and family. The ibbons opened an account at the MInd-
bury Branch Savings Bank; the Ribbons drove to Church, monopolizing
the pony-chaise, which was for the use of the servants at the Hall. The
domestic were dismissed at her pleasure. The Scotch gardener, who still
lingered on the premises, taking a pride in his walls and hothouses, and
indeed making a pretty good livelihood by the garden, which he formed,
and of which he sold the produce at Southampton, found the Ribbons
eating candles in n sunshiny morning at the south-wall, and had his ears
bowed, which he remonstrated about this attack on his property. He and
his Scotch wife and his Scotch children, the only respectable inhabitants of
queen's Crawled, were forced to migrate, with their goods and their chattels,
and left the stately comfortable gardens to go to waste, and the flower-
beds to run to send. Poor Lady Crawled's rose-garden became the
dreariest wilderness. Only two or three domestic shuddered in the bleak
old servant's hall. The stables and offices were vacant, and shut up, and
half ruined. Sir Pitt lived in private, and boozed nightly with Horrocks,
his butler or house-stewarl (as he now began to be called), and the ban-
done Ribbons. The times were very much changed since the period
when she drove to Mulbury in the spring-cart, and called the small
tradesmen '' Sir.'' It may have been shame, or it may have been dislike
of his neighbours, but the old Cynic of queen's Curled hardly iasued
from his park-gates at all now. e quarrelled with his agents, and
screwed his tenants by letter. IIi days were past in conducting his own
correspondence ; the lawyers and farm-bailiffs, who had to do business with
him, could not reach him but through the Ribbons, who received them at
the door of the housekeeper's room, which commanded the back entrance
by which they were admitted; nd so the Baronet's daily perplexzities
increased, and his embnrrassments multiplied round him.
The horror of Pitt Crawled may be imagined, as these reports of his
father's dotage reached the most exemplary and correct of gentlemen.
He trembled daily lest he should hear that the Ribbons was proclaimed
his second legal mother-in-law. After that first and last visit, his father's
name was never mentioned in Pitt's polite and genteel establishment. It
was the skeleton in his house, and all the family walked by it in terror
and silence. The Countess Bouthdown kept on dropping per each at the

sir
lodge-gate the most exciting traets, traets which ought to frighten the
hair of your head. Mrs. But at the parsonage nightly looked out to see
if the sky was red over the elms behind which the Hall stood, and the
mansion was on fire. Sir G. Wapshot and Sir H. Fuddlestone, old friends
of the house, would'not sit on the bench with Sir Pitt at quarter Sessions,
and cut him dead in the High-street of Southampton, where the reprobate
stool offering lis dirty old hands to them. Nothing had any effect upon
him; he put his hands into his pockets, and burst out laughing, as he
scrambled into his carriage and four; he used to burst out laughing at
Lady Southdown's tracts; and he Laughed at his sons, and at the world,
and at the Ribhons when she was angry, which was not seldom.
Miss Horrocks was installed as housekeeper at queen's Clear, and
ruled all the domestic there with great majesty and rigour. All the
servants were instructed to address her as ' Mum,'' or  Madam''-and
there was one little maid, on her promotion, who persisted in calling her
 My Only,'' without any rebuke on the part of the housekeeper. `There
has been better Indeed, and there has been worse, Hester,'' was Miss
Horrocks' reply to this compliment of her inferior: so she ruled, having
supreme power over all except her father, whom, however, she treated
with considerable haughtiness, warning him not to be too familiar in his
behaviour to one ``s was to be a Baronet's lady.'' Indeed, she rehearsed
that exalted part in life with great satisfaction to herself, and to the
amusement of old Sir Pitt, who chucklel at her airs and graces, and
would laugh by the hour together at her assumption of dignity and
imitations of genteel life. lIke swore it was as good as a play to see her in
the character of a fine dome, and he made her put on one of the first Lady
Craven's court-dresses, swearing, (entirely to Miss HIorrocks' own con-
credence,) that the dress became her prodigiously, nd threatening to
give her off that very instant to Court in a coach-and-four. She had
the ransneking of the wardrobe of the to defence ladies, and cut and
asked their posthumous finery so as to suit her own tastes and figure.
And she would have liked to take possession of their jewels and triukets
too; but the old Baronet and locked them away in his private cnbinet, nor
could she coax or wheels him out of the keys. And it is a fact, that
some time after she left ucen's Crawled a copy-book belonging to this
lady was discovered, which showed that she had taken great pains in
private to learn the art of writing in general, and especially of writing her
own name as Lady Crawled, Lady Betsy Horrocks, Lady Elizabeth
Crawled, &c.
Though the good people of the Parsonage never went to the Hall, and
shunned the horrid old dotard its owner, yet they kept a strict knowledge
of all that happened there, and were looking out every day for the cat-
stooped, for which Miss Horroeks was also eager. But Fate intervened
enviously, and prevented her from receiving the reward due to such
immaculate love and virtue.
One day the Baronet surprised ``her ladyship,'' as he jocularly
called her, seated at that old and useless piano in the drawing-room,
which had scarcely been touched since Beck Sharp played quadrilles
upon it. Seated at the piano with the utmost gravity, and squalling

to the best of her power in imitation of the music which she had sometimes
heard. The little kitchen-maid on her promotion was standing at her
mistress's side, quite delighted during the operation, ad agging her
head up and down, and crying '`For, Mum, 'tis pitiful,''-just like a
genteel sycophant in a real drawing-room.

This incident made the old Baronet roar with laughter, as usual. He
narrated the circumstance a dozen times to Horrocks in the course of the
evening, and greatly to the discomfiture of Miss Horrocks. He trimmed
on the table as if it had been a musical instrument and squalled in imitation
of her manner of singing. He vowed that such a beautiful voice ought to
be cultivated, and declared she ought to have singing-masters, in which
proposals she saw nothing ridiculous. He was in great spirits that night;
and drank with his friend and butler an extraordinary quantity of rum-
and-water-at a very late hour the faithful friend and domestic conducted
his master to his bed-room.
Half an hour afterwards there was a great hurry and bustle in the house.

Lights went about from window to window in the lonely desolate old Hall,
whereof but two or three rooms were ordinarily occupied by its owner.
Presently, a boy on a pony went galloping off to Mudbury, to the Dog-
to's house there. And in another hour (by which fact we aseertain how
carefully the excellent Mrs. bRute Crawled had always kept up an under-
standing with the great house), that lady in her clogs and clash, the
Reverend But Crawled, and James Crawled, her son, had walked over
from the rectory through the park, and had entered the mansion by
the open hall-door.
They passed through the hall and the small oak parlour, on the table of
which stool the three tumblers and the empty rum-bottle which had served
for Sir Pitt's carouse, and through that apartment into Sir Pitt's study,
where they found Miss Horrors, of the guilty ribbons, with a wild air,
trying at the presses and escritoires wit a bunch of keys. She dropped
them with a scream of terror, us little MRs. But's eyes flushed out at her
from under her black calash.
`Look at that, James un Mr. Crawled,'' cried Mrs. But, pointing at
the scared nature of the black-eyed, guilty wench.
 He gave 'em me; he gave 'c me.'' she cried.
Over them you, you abandoned, crcuturel'' screamed Mrs. But.
Bear witness, Mr, Curled, we found this good-To-nothing woman in the
act of, stealing your brother's property; and she will be hanged, as I
always said-ghewould.''
Betsy looks quite dauntel, flung herself down on her knees, bursting
into teas. ,but those who know a really good woman are nwire that
she is not i a hurry t forgive, and that the humiliation of an enemy is
triumph to her soul.
 Ring the bell, James,'' MRs. But sir. Go on ringing it till the
people come?' The three or for domestic resident in the deserted old
house came presently nt that jangling all continued sons.
 Put thatwoman i the strong-so,'' she said.  We caught her in
the act of sobbing Sir Pitt. Mr. While, you'll make out her committal
-and, eddies, you 'll drive her other in the spring-cart, in the morning,
to Southampton Gaol,''

pocket a large pair of paste shoe-buckles which had excited her admiration,
and which she had just appropriated out of one of the bookcases in the
study, where they had lain.

 Give up your keys, you hardened house,'' hissed out the virtuous
little lady in the clash.
``And here 's a candle, Mum, and if you please, Mum, I can show you
her room, Mum, and the press in the housekeeper's room, Mum, where she
keeps ears and heaps of things, Mum,'' cried out the eager little Hester
with a profusion of courtesy.
Hold your tongue, if you please. I know the room which the creature
occupics perfectly well. Mrs. Brown, have the goodness to come with me,
and Besides don't you lose sight of that woman,'' said Mrs. But, seizing
the candle.- Mr. Crawled you had better go up stairs, and see that they
are not murdering your unfortunate brother''-and the clash, escorted
by Mrs. Brown, walked nay to the apartment which, as she said truly,
she knew perfectly well.
But went up stairs, and found the Doctor from Mulbury, with the
frightened Horrocks over his master in a chair. They were trying to
bleed Sir Pitt Crawled.
WIth the early morning an express was sent of to Mr. Pitt Crawled by
the rector's lady, who assumed the command of everything, and bad
watched the old Baronet through the night. He had been brought back
to a sort of life; he could not speak, but seemed to recognise people.
Mrs. But kept resolutely by his bed-side. She never seemed to want to
sleep, the little woman, and did not close her fiery black eyes once, though
the Doctor snored in the arm-chair. Horrocks made some wild efforts
to assert his authority and assist his master: but Mrs. But called him
n tipsy old wretch, and bade him never show his face again in that house
or he should be transportel like his abominable daughter.
Terrified by her manner he slunk down to the oak parlour where Mr.
James was, who, having tried the bottle standing there and found no liquor
in it, ordered Mr. Horroeks to get another bottle of rum, which he
fetehed with clean glasses, and to which the Rector and his son sat down:
ordering Horrocks to put down the keys at that instant and never to show
his face again.
Cowed by this behaviour Horroeks gare up the keys: and he and his
daughter slunk off silently though the night, and gave up possession of
the house of Green's Crawled.

 DIE heir of Parsley arrived nt
=r f
home, in due time, after this
catastrophe, and henceforth may
be said to have reigned in
queen's Crawled. or though
the old Baronet survived many
months, he never recovered the
use of his intellect or his speech
completely, and the government
of the estate devolved upon his
elder son. In a strange condition
Pitt found it. Sir Pitt was always
buying and mortgaging: he had
twenty men of business, and
quarrels with each; quarrels with
all his tenants, and lawsuits with
them ; lawsuite with the lawyers;
lnwsuits with the Mining and
Dock Companion in which he was
proprietor; and with every person
with whom he hnl business. 1o
unravel these difficulties, nnl set the estate clear, was a task worthy of the
orderly and persevering diplomatist of Pumpernickel : and he set himself
to work with prodigious assiduity. His whole family, of course, was
transported to queen's Crawled, whither Lady Southdown, of course, can
too,; and she set about converting the parish under the Rector's nose, and
brought down her irregular clergy to the dismay of the angry Mrs. But.
Sir Pitt had concluded no bargain for the sole of the living of ucen's
Crawled; when it should drop, er Kinship propose to take the parsonage
into her own hands, and present a young proceed to the Rectory ; on which
subject the liplomatic Pitt said nothing.
Mrs. But's intentions with regard to Miss Betsy Horrocks were not
carried into effect: and she said no visit to Southampton Gaol. She
and her father left the Hall, when the letter took possession of the
Crawled Arms in the village, of which he had got a lease from Sir
it. The ex-butler had obtained a small freehold there likewise, which
gave him a vote for the rough. The Rector had another of these notes,
and these and four others formed the representative body which returned
the two members for queen's Crawled.

vANITY FAIR.
There was a show of courtesy kept up between the Rectory and the
1Hall ladies, between te younger ours at least, for Mrs. But and Lady
Southdown never could meet without batlles, and gradually ceased seeing
each utter. Her Ladyship kept her room when the ladies from the Rectory
visited their cousins at the MIll. Perhaps Mr. Pitt was not very much
displeased at these occasional absences of his mamma-in-law. le believed
the Inside family to be the greatest and wiscst, and most interesting in
the world, and her Ladyship and his aunt had long held ascendancy over
him; but sometimes he felt that she commanded him too much. To be
considered young as complimentary doubtless; but at six-and-forty to be
treated as a boy was sometimes mortifying. LAdy Jane yielded up every
thing, however, to her mother. She was only fond of her children in
private; and it was lucky for her that Lady Southdown's multifarious
business, her conferenees with ministers, and her correspondence with all
the issionaries of Africa, Asia, and hustralasin, &c. occupied the venerable
Countess a great deal, so that she had but little time to devote to her
granddaughter, the little Mantilla, and her grandson, Master Pitt Crawled.
1he latter was a feeble child: and it was only by prodigious quantities of
colonel that Lady Southlown was able to keep him in life at all.
As for Sir TPitt he retired into those very npartments where Lady
Crawled had been previously extinguished, and here was tended by Miss
Hester, the girl upon her promotion, with constant care and assiduity.
What love, what fidelity, what constancy is there equal to that of a nurse
with good wages: they south pillows: and make arrow-root: they get
up at lights: they bear complain and qucrulousness: they see the sun
shining out of doors and distant lo go abroad : they sleep on arm-
chairs, and eat their mels in solitude: thy pass long long evenings doing
nothing, watching the course, and te patient's drink shimmering in the
iyg: they read the weekly paper the whole week through; and LAw'
Serious Call or le Whole Duty ol Man sulfiees them for literature for the
year-and we quarrel wit to bca, when their relations come to see
them once a week, :a Il go is juggled in in their linen-basket.
Ladies, what man's love is there that would stand a year's nursing of the
object of his affection? Whereas a nurse will stand by you for ten pounds
a quarter, and we think her too highly paid. At last Mr. Crawled grim-
bled a good deal about king half as much to Mis Hester for her
constant attendance upon to Baronet his father.
Of sunshiny days this old gentleman was-taken out in a chair on the
terrace-the very elair which Miss by he had at Brighton, and
which had been transported thence with a number of LAdy Southlown's
elects to queen's Crawled. Lady Jane always walked by the old man:
and was an evident favourite with him. He used to nod many times to

this was all that was left after more than seventy years of cunning and
struggling, and drinking and seeing, nd sin and selfishness-a whim-
peering old idiot put in and out of bed and cleaned and fed like n baby.
At last a day came when the nurse's occupation was over. Early one
morning as Pitt Crawled was at his steward's and bailiff's books in the
study, a knock came to the door, and Hester presented herself dropping a
curse, and said,
 If you please, i Pitt, Sir Pitt died this morning, Sir Pitt. I was
a-making of his toast, Sir Pitt, for his gruel, Sir Pitt, which he took eery
morning regular at six, Sir Pitt, and-I thought I heard a one-like, Sir
Pitt-and-and-and--''. She dropped another course.

improvements which he would make. lIe would not use his aunt's
money previously, lest Sir TPitt should recover, and his outlay be in vain.
All the blinds were pulled down at the Hall and Rector : the church
bell was tolled, and the chancel hung in black; mud But Crawled did'not
go to a coursing meeting, but went nd dine quietly at Fuddlestone,
where they talked about his deceased brother and young Sir Pitt over
their port. Miss Betsy, who was by this time married to a suaddler at
Mudbury, cried a good deal. The family surgeon rose over and paid
his respecetful compliments, and inquiries for the hell of their lady-
ships.  The death was talked about ant Mulbury and at the Crawled
Arms; the landlord wherceof had become reconciled with the Rector of
late, who was occasionally known to step into the parlour and taste Mr,
Horrocks' mild beer.

husband, Sir Pitt.
I will write, of course,'' Sir Pitt said, ``and invite him to the funeral:
it will he but becoming.''
`And-and- Mrs. Rawdon,'' said Lady Jane, timidly.

 Mrs. Rawdon must of course be asked,'' said Sir Pitt, resolutely.

family,'' Sir Pitt replied. `If you please, Lady Jane, you will write a
letter to Mrs. Rawdon Crawled, requesting her presence upon this
melancholy occasion.''
' Jane, I forbid you to put pen to paper'' cried the Countess.
I believe I am the head of this family,'' Sir Pitt repeated; ``and
however much I may regret any circumstance which may lead to your
Ladyship quitting this house, must, if you please, continue to govern it
as I see fit,''
Lady Southdown rose up as magnificent as Mrs. Siddons in Lady
Macbeth, and ordered that horses might be put to her carriage. If her

thoughts.
We don't turn you out of our house, Mamma,'' said the timid Lady
Jane imploringly.
You invite such company to it as no Christian lady should meet, and
I will have my horses to-morrow morning.''
HAve the goodness to write, Jane, under my dictation,'' said Sir Pitt
rising and throwing himself into an attitude of command like the Poor-
trait of a Gentleman in the Exhibition, '`nd begin. queen's Crawled,
September 14, 182.-My der brother--'
Hearing these decisive and terrible words, Lady MIacbeth, who had
been waiting for a sign of weakness or acillation on the part of her
son-in-law, rose, and with a cruel look, left the library. Lady Jane
looked up to her husband as if she would fain follow and soothe her
mamma; but Pitt forbade his wife to move.
`She won't go away,'' he said. She has let her house at Brighton,
and has spent her last half-year's divided. A Countess living at an in
is a ruined woman. I have been waiting long for an opportunity to take
this-this decisive step, my love; for, as you must perceive, it is impos-
sible that there should be two ehiefs in a family: and now, if you please,
we will resume the dictation. My dear brother, the melancholy intelligence
which it is my duty to convey to my family must have long been anticipated
by,''' c.
In a word, Pitt having come to his kingdom, and having My good luck,
or desert rather, as he considered, assumed almost all the fortune which
his other relatives had expected, was determined to treat his family kindly
and respectably, and make a house of need's Curled once more. It
pleased him to think that he should be its chief. He proposed to use the
vast influence that his commanding talents and position must speedily
acquire for him in the county to get his brother placed and his cousins
decently provided for, and perhaps had a little sting of repentance as he
thought that he was the proprietor of all that they had hoped for. In the
course of three or four lays' reign his bearing was changed, and his plans
quite fixed : he determined to rule justly and honestly, to repose Lady
Southlown, and to be on the friendliest possible terms with all the real-
tons of his blood.
So he dictated a letter to his brother Rawdon-a solemn and elaborate
letter, containing the profoundest observations, couched in the longest
words, and filling with wonder the simple little secretary, who wrote under
her husband's order. What an orator this will be,'' thought she, ``when
he enters the House of Commons'' (on which point, and on the tyranny of
Lady Southdown, Pitt and sometimes dropped hints to his wife in bed);
`` how wise and good, and what a genius my husband is I fancied him
a little gold; but how good, and what a genius l''
The fact is, Pitt Crawled had got eery word of the letter by heart, and
had studied it, with diplomatic severe, deeply and perfectly, long before
he thought fit to communicate it to his astonished wife.
This letter, with a huge black border and seal, was accordingly dispatched

Crawled was but half-pleased at the receipt of it.  What's the use of

He carried the letter, as he did all difficulties, to Beck, upstairs in
her bed-room-with her chocolate, which he always made and took to her
of a morning.
He put the tray with the breakfast and the letter on the dressing-table,
before which Beck same coming her yellow hair. She took up the black-
edged missive, and having read it, she jumped up from the chair, crying

e He's not left us anything, Beck. I had my share when I came
of age.''
e You 'll never be of age, you silly old man,'' Beck replied. `Run out
now to Madam Brandy's, for I must have some mourning: and get a
crape on your hat, and a black waistcoat--I don't think you've got one;
order it to be brought home to-morrow, so that he may be able to start
on Thursday,''
e You don't mean to go?'' Rawdon interposed.
e Of course I mean to go. I mean that Lady Jane shall present me at
Court next year. I mean that your brother shall give you a seat in Par-
liament, you stupid old creature. I mean that Lord Sense shall have
your vote and his, my dear, old, silly man; and that you shall be an
Irish Secretary, or a West Indian Governor: or a Treasure, or a Consul,
or some such thing.''
Posting will cost a voice of a lot of money,'' grumbled Rawdon.
 WE might take Southdown's carriage, which ought to be present at
the funeral, as he is a relation of the family: but, no-I intend that we
shall go by the coach. They 'll like it better. It seems more humble--''
Rawdy goes of course'' the Colonel asked.
No such thing; why pay an extra place He's too big to travel
bodkin between you and me. Let him stay here in the nursery, and
Brings can make him a black frock. Go you: and do as I did you. and
you had best tell Sparks, your man, that old Sir Pitt is dead, and that you
will come in for something considerable when the affairs are arranged.
I 'll tell this to Rnggles, who has been pressing for money, and it will
console poor Raggles.'' And to Beck been sipping her choeolate.
When the faithful Lord Sense arrived in the evening, he found Beck
and her companion, who was no other than our friend Brings, busy
calling, dripping., uipping, and tearing all sorts of black stuffs aailable
for the melancholy occasion.
 Miss Brings and I are plunged in grief and despondency for the death
of our papa,'' Rebecca said. : Si Pitt Crawled is dead, my lord. We
have been tearing our hair all the morning, and now we are tearing up
our old clothes,''
Oh, Rebecca, how can you--'' was all that Brings could say as she
turned up her eyes.
 Oh, Rebcecca, how can you-'' echoed my Lord. ``So that old
scoundrel 's deal, is he DIe might have been a Peer if he had played his
cards better. MIr. Pitt had very nearly made him; but he patted always
at the wrong time. What an old Silenus it was.''
 I might lay been Silenus's widow,'' said became. `Don't you
remember, Miss Brings, how you peeped in at the door; and saw old Sir
Pitt on his knees to me'' ' Miss Brings, our old friend, blushed very
much at this reiniscence ; and was glad when Lord Sense ordered her
to go down stairs and make him a cup of tea.
Brings was the house-dog whom Rebecca had provided s guardian of
her innocence and reputation. Miss Crawled had left her a little annuity.
She would have been content to remain in the Crawled family with Lady

and, who was good to her and to everybody; but Lady Southdown
dismissed poor Brings as quickly as decency permitted; and Mr.Pitt (who
thought himself much injured by the uncalled-for generosity of his deceased
relative towards a lady who ll only been Miss Crawled's faithful retainer
a score of years) made no objeetions to that exercise of the widower's
authority. Bowls and Firkin likewise received their legacies, and their
dismissal; and married and set up a lodging-house, according to the
custom of their kind.
Brings tried to live with her relations in the country, but found that
attempt was vain after the better society to which she had been accus-
tomed. Those persons, small tradesmen in a country town, quarrelled
over Miss Brings's forty pounds n-year, as eagerly and more openly than
Miss Crawled's kinafolk had for that lady's inheritance. Brings's brother,
a radical matter and grower, called his sister a purse-proud aristocrat, be-
cause she would not advance as part of her capital to stock his shop: and
she would have done it most likely, but that their sister, a dissenting
shoemaker's lady, at variance with the matter and grower who went to
another chapel, showed how their brother was on the verge of bnankruptcy,
and took possession of BRidges for a while. The dissenting shoemaker
wanted Miss Brings to send his son to college, and make a gentleman of
him. Between them the two families got a great portion of her private
saints out of her: and finally she fled to London followed by the
anathemas of both, in determined to seek for servitude ngin as infinitely
less serious than liberty. And ndvertising in the papers that a '` Gentle-
woman of agreeable manners, and accustomed to the best society was
anxious to,'' &c., she took up her residence with Mr. MBowls in Half Moon
Street, and waited the result of the advertisement.
So it was that she fell in with Iebecea. Mrs. Rawson's dashing little
carriage and ponies was whirling down the street one day, just as Miss
Brings, fatigued, had reached Mr. Bowls's door, after a weary walk to the
Times Other in the City, to insert her advertisement for the sixth time.
Rebecca was driving, and at once recognised the gentlewoman with agree-
able manners, and being a perfectly good-humoured woman, as we have
seen, and having a regard for lriggs, she pulled up the monies at the
door-steps, gave the reins to the groom, and jumping out had hold of
both Brings's hands, before she of the agreeable manners had recovered
from the shock of seeing an old friend.
Brings cried, and Beck laughed a great deal, and kissed the gentle-
woman as soon as they got into the passage; and thence into Mrs, Bowls's
front parlour, with the red moreen curtains, and the round looking-glass,
with the eminent cage above, gazing upon the back of the ticket in the
window which announced ' Apartments to Let.''
Brings told all her history midst those perfectly uncnllcl-for sobs and
jaculations of wonder with which women of her soft nature salute an old
acquaintance, or regard a rencontre in the street ; for though people meet
other people every day, yet some there are who insist upon discovering
miracles; and women, even though they have disliked each other, begin to
cry when they went, imploring and rccmbering the time when they last

quarrelled. So, in a word, Brings told all her history, and Beck gasea
narrative of her own life, with her usual artlessness and cundour.
Mrs. Bowls, late Firkin, came and listened gaily in the passage to the
hysterical sniffing and giggling which went on in the front parlour. They
had never been a favourite of her's. Since the establishment of the married
couple in London they had frequented their former friends of the house of
Raggles, and did not like the latter's account of the Colonel's eager.
`I would'not trust him, Laugh, my boy,'' Boys remarked: and his wife, when
Mrs. Rawdon issued from the parlour, only saluted the lady with a very
sour course; and her fingers were like so many sauasages, cold and lifeless,
when she held them out in deference to Mrs. Rawdon, who persisted in
shaking hands with the retired lady's maid. She whirled away into
Piccadilly, nodding, with the sweetest of smiles towards Miss Brings, la
hung holding at the window close under the advertisement-card, and at
the next moment was in the Park with a half dozen of dinners canteriag
after her carriage.
When he found how her friend was situated, and how having n
sung legacy from Miss Morley, salary was no object to our gentleman,
Beck instantly formed some benevolent little domestic plans concerning
her. This was just such a companion as would suit her establishment.
and she invited Brings to come to dinner with her that very evening, when
she would show her dear little darling Rawlon.
Mrs. Bowls cautioned her longer against venturing into the lion's on,
t wherein you will rue it, Miss l3., mark my words, and as sure as m5
name is Bodwls.'' And rings promised to be very cautious. The upshot
of which caution was that she went to live with MRs. Rawlon the est
week, and had lent Rawdon Candle six hundred pounds upon aunt
before six more months were over.

Sir Pitt Crawled warned of their
arrival, Colonel Crawled and his
wife took a couple of places in
the same old Highflyer coach, by
which HRehecca had travelled in
the defence Baronet's company,
and on her first journey into the
world some nine years before.
How well she remembered the
Inn Yard, and the ostler to
whom she refused money, and
the insinuating Cnmbridge lad
who wrapped her in his coat on
the journey. Rawdon took his
place outside, and would have
liked to drive, but his grief for-
bade him. He snte by the coach-
man, and talked about horses and
the road the whole way; and
who kept the inns, and who horsed the coach by which he had travelled
so many a time, when he and Pitt were boys going to Eton. At Yalbury
era carriage and a pair of horses received them, with a coachman in black.
It's the old drag, Rawdon,'' Rebecea said, as they got in.  The worms
hae eaten the cloth a good deal-there's the stain which Sir Pitt-hal I
see Dawson the Ironmonger has his shutters up-which Sir Pitt made such
a noise about. It was a bottle of cherry brandy he broke which we went
to fetch for your aunt from Southampton. How time flies, to be sure
that can't be Holy Talboys, that bouncing girl standing by her mother at
the cottage there. I remember her a many little church picking weeds
in the garden.''
e in gal,'' said Rawdon, returning the salute which the cottage gave
him, by two fingers applied to his crape hat-band. Beck bowl and
saluted, and recognised people here and there graciously. Their rough-
nations were inexpressibly pleasant to her. It seemed as if she was not
an impostor any more, and was coming to the home of her ancestors.
Rawdon was rather abashed, and cast down on the other hand. What
recollections of boyhood and innocence might have been flitting across
his brain What pangs of dim remorse and doubt and shame?

e Your sisters must be young women now,'' Recbeeca said, thinking of
those girls for the first time perhaps since she had left them.
 Don't know, I'm she,'' replied the colonel.  Hullo1 here's old
Mother Look. 1Now-do-do, Mrs. Lock. Remember me, don't you
Master Hadon, helP Dammy how those old women last; she was a
hundred when I was a boy.''
They were going through thelodge-gates kept by old Mrs. Lock, whose
hand llebccca insisted upon shaking, as she flung open the creaking old
iron gate, and the carriage passed between the two moss-grown pillars
surmounted by the dove and serpent.
 The governor has cut into the timber,'' woman said, looking about,
and then was silent-so was lUcky. Both of them were rather agitated,
and thinking of old times. LIe about Eton, and his mother, whom he
remembered, n frigid demure woman, and a sister who died, of whom he
had been passionately fond; and how he used to thrash Pitt; and about
little Rawdy at home. And Rebecea thought about her own youth, and
the dark secrets of those early tainted days; and of her entrance into life
by yonder gates; and of Miss Pinkcrton, and Joe, and Amelia.
The gravel walk and terrace lad been scraped quite clean. A grand
painted attachment was already over the great entrance, and two very
solemn and tall personages in black flung open each a leaf of the door as
the carriage pulled up at the familiar steps. Rawdon turned red, and
Beck somewhat pale, as they passed through the old hall, arm in arm.
She pinchel her husband's are as they entered the oak parlour, where Sir
lot and his wife were ready to receive them. Sir Pitt in black, Lady
Jane in black, and my ITaly Southdown with a large black head-piece of
boughs and fetlers, which waves on her Ladyship's head like an under-
taker's tray.
Sir Pitt had judged correct, that she would not quit the premises.
She contented herself by prcserving a solemn and stony silence, when in
company of Pitt and his rebellious wife, and he frightening the children in
the nursery by the ghastly gloom of her demeanour. Only a very faint
bending of the sea-dress and plumes welcomed Rawdon and his wife, as
those prodigals returned to their family.
o say the truth, they were not affected very much one way or other by
this coolness. Her Ladyship, strange to say, was a person only of secondary
consideration in their minds just then-they were intent upon the reception
which the reigning brother and sister would afford them.
Pitt with rather a heightened colour went up and shook his brother by
the hand; and saluted llebeccn with a hand-shake and a very low bow.
But Lady Jane took both the hands of her sister-in-law and kissed her
affectionately. The embrace somehow brought tears into the eyes of the
little adventuress-which ornaments, as we know, she wore very seldom.

Pardon, encouraged by this demonstration on his sister's part, toiled up

his wife were together again. 'Pitt's got fat too, and is doing the thing

hnndsomely.  He can afford it,'' said Rcbecca, and agreed in her
husband's farther opinion, `" that the mother-in-law was a tremendous old
Guy-and that the sisters were rather well-looking young women,''
They, too, had been summoned from school to attend the funeral
cereonics. It seemed Sir it Crawled, for the dignity of the house
and family, id thought right to have about the place as many persons in
black as could possibly be assembled. All the men and maids of the
house, the old women of the Alms House, whom the elder Sir Pitt had
cheated out of a great portion of their due, the parish clerk's family, mud
the special remainder of both 1All and ectory were habited in subtle;
added to these, the undertaker's men, at least a score, with cries and hat-
beds, and who made a goodly show when the great burying show took
place-but these are mute personages in our drama, and having nothing to
do or say need occupy a very little space here.
With regard to her sisters-in-laws became did not attempt to forget her
former position of Governess towards them, but recalled it frankly and
kindly, and asked them about their studies with great gravity, and told
them that she had thought of them many and many a day, and longed to
know of their welfare. In fact you would have supposed that ever since
she and left them she had not ceased to keep them uppermost in her
thoughts, and to take the tenderest interest in their welfare. So supposed
Lady Crawled herself and her young sisters.
She's hardly changed since eight years,'' said Miss losalind to Miss
Violet, as they were preparing for dinner.
Those red-haired women look wonderfully well,'' replies the other.
 Her's is much darker than it was; I think she must dye it,'' Miss
Rosalind added. ` She is stouter, too, and altogether improved,'' con-
tinued Miss osalind, who was disposed to be very fat.
At least she gives herself no airs, and remembers that she was
our Governess once,'' Miss Violet said, intimating that it betitted all
governesses to keep their proper place, and forgetting altogether that she
was granddaughter not only of Sir Wulpole Crawled, but of Mr. Dawson
of Mudbury, and so had a coal-scuttle in her scutcheon. There are other
very well-meaning people whom one meets every day in Vanity lair, who
are surely equally oblivious.
 It can't be true what the girls at the Rectory said, that her mother
was an opera-danger-''
'A person can't help their birth,'' Rosalind replied with great like-
reality. `And I agree with our brother, that as she is. n the family, of
course we are bound to notice her. I am sure Aunt But need not talk:
she wants to marry late to young llooper, the wine-merchant, and
absolutely asked him to come to the Rectory for orders.''
`I wonder whether Lady Southdown will go away, she looked very
glum upon Mrs. Rawdon,'' the other said.
 I wish she would. I won't read the  Washerwoman of Finches
Common,''' vowed Violet; and so saying, and avoiding a passage at the
end of which a certain coffin was placed with a couple of winters, and
light perpetually burning in the closed room, these young women came
down to the family dinner, for which the bell rang as usual.

ANY FAIR.
But before this, Lady Jane conducted Rebecca to the aspartments pre-
red for her, which with the rest of the house had assumed a very much
improved appearance of order and comfort during Pitt's reigned, and
here beholding that MIss. Rawson's modest little trunks had arrived, and
were placed in the bed-room and dressing-room adjoining, helped her to
take off her neat black bonnet and cloak, and asked her sister-in-law in
what more she would be useful.
 What I should like best,'' said Rebeccs, ``would be to go to the
nursery ; and see your dear little children'' On which the two ladies looked
very kindly at each other, and went to that apartment hand in hand.
lucky admired little Mutildna, who was not quite four years of, as the
most charming little more in the world; and the boy, a little fellow of two
years-pale, heavy-eyed, and large-headed, she pronounced to be a perfect
prodigy in point of size, intelligence, and but.
i wish Mamma would not insist on giving him so much melicine,''
Lady Jane said, with a sigh. `I often think we should all be better
without it,'' And then Lady Jane and her new-found friend had one of
those confidential medical conversations about the children, which all
mothers, and most women, as I am given to understand, delight in. Fifty
years ago, and when the present writer, being an interesting little boy,
was ordered out of the room with the ladies after dinner, I remember
quite well that their talk was chiefly about their ailmcnts; and putting this
question directly to two or three since, I have always got from them the
acknowledgment that times are not changed. LEt no fair readers remark
for themselves this very evening when they quit the dessert-table, and
assemble to celebrate the drawing-room mysteries. Well-in half-an-hour
Beck and LAdy Jane were close and intimate friends-and in the course
of the evening her Ladyship informed Sir Pitt that she thought her ne
sister-in-law was a kind, frank, unaffected, and affectionate young
oman.
And so having easily won the daughter's good-will, the indefatigable
little woman bent herself to conciliate the august Lady Southdown. As
soon as she found her Ladyship alone, Rebecca attacked her on the nursery
question at once, and said that her own little boy was saved, actually
saved, by colonel, freely adminiatered, when all the physicians in Paris
had given the dear child up. And then she mentioned how often she had
heard of Lady Soutldown from that excellent man the Reverend Lwrence
Grills, Minister of the chapel in My Fair, which she frequented; and
how her views were very much changed by circumstances and misfortunes;
and how she hoped that a past life spent in worldliness and error might
not incespacitate her from more serious thought for the future. She described
how in former days she had been indebted to Mr. Crawled for religions
instruction, touched upon the  Washerwoman of Finches Common,'' which
she had real with the greatest profit, and asked not Lady Emily, its
gifted author, now Lady Emily Hornblower, at Cape Town, where her
husband had strong hopes of becoming Bishop of Cnfraria.
But she crowned all, and confirmed herself in Lady Southdown's favour,
by feeling very much agitated and unwell after the funeral, and requesting
her Ladyship's smell advice, which the Widower not only gave, hut,

ever, came privately in the night to lucky's room, with a parcel of favourite

Mrs., Rawdon should take.

Beck first accepted the tracts, and began to examine them with great
interest, engaging the Danger in a conversation concerning them and the
welfare of her soul, by which means she hoped that her body might escape
meditation. But after the religious topics were exhausted, Lady Macbeth
would not quit Beck's chamber until her cup of night-drink was emptied
too; and poor Mrs. Rawdon was compelled actually to assume a look of
gratitude, and to swallow the melicine under the unyielding old Widower's
nose, who left her victim finally with a benediction.
It did not much comfort Mrs. bRandon; her countenance was very queer
when Rawdon came in and heard what had happened; and his explosions
of laughter were as loud as usual, when Beck, with a fun which she could
not disguise, even though it was at her own expense, described the

acted the whole scene for them. She put on a night-cap and gown. She
preached a great sermon in the true serious manner: she lectured on the
virtue of the medicine which she pretended to administer, with a gravity
of imitation so perfect, that you would have thought it was the Countess's
ow Roman nose through which she snuffled. :`Give us Lady Southdown
and the black dose,'' was a constant cry amongst the folks in Beck's little
drawing-room in My Fair. And for the first time in her life the Danger
Countess of Southdown was made amusing.
Sir Pitt remembered the testimonials of respect and veneration which
Rebceca had paid personally to himself in early days, and was tolerably
well disposed towards her. The marriage, ill-advised as it was, had
improved London very much--that was clear from the Colonel's altered
habits and demeanour-and had it not been a lucky union as regarded
Pitt himself2 The cunning diplomatist smiled inwardly as he owned that
he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not to
cry out against it. His satisfaction was not covered by Rehecca's own
statements, behaviour, and conversation.
She doubled the deference which before had charmed him, calling out
his conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise Pitt himself,
who, always inclined to respect his own talents, admired them the more when
Rebecca pointed them out to him. With her sister-in-law, Rebeeca was satin-
factory able to prove, that it was Mrs. But Crawled who brought about
the marriage which she afterwards so calumniated : that it was Mrs. But's
avarice-who loved to in all  Miss Crawled's fortune, and deprive
Rawdon of his aunt's four-which caused and invented all the wicked
reports against Rebeccn. `t She succeeded in making us poor,'' Rebeccas
said, with an air of angelic patience; ``but how can I be angry with a
woman who has given me one of the best husbands in the world And has
not her own avarice been sufficiently punished by the ruin of her own
hopes, and the loss of the property by which she set so much store?
Poor'' she cried. `Dear Lady Jane, what care we for poverty I am
used to it from childhood, and I am often thankful that Miss Crawled's
money has gone to restore the splendour of the noble old family of which
I am so proud to be a member. I am sure Sir Pitt will make a much
letter use of it than Rawdon would.''
All these speeches were reported to Sir Pitt by the most faithful of
wives, and increased the favourable impression which Rebecca made; so
much so, that when on the third day after the funeral the family party
were at dinner, Sir Pitt Crawled, carving fowls at the head of the table,
actually said to Me. Rawdon, ``Them Releeeca, may lI gie you as wing''

were engaged for that rate. A woman or two, and three or four under-
taker's men, the best whom Southampton could furnish, dressed in black,
and of a proper stealthy and tragical demeanour, had charge of the remains
which they watched turn about, having the housekeeper's room for their
place of rendezvous when off duty, where they played at cards in privacy
and drank their beer.
The members of the family and eerants of the house went away from
the gloomy spot, where the bones of the descendants of an ancient line of
knights and gentlemen, lay awaiting their final consignment to the family
crypt. No regrets attended them, she those of the poor woman who had
hoped to be Sir Pitt's wife and widow, and who had fled in disgrace from
the Hall over which she had so nearly been a rule. Beyond her and a
favourite old pointer he had, and between whom and himself an attachment
subsisted during the period of his imbecility, the old man had not a single
friend to mourn him, having indeed, during the whole course of his life,
never taken the least pains to secure one. Could the best and kindest of
us who depart from the earth, have an opportunity of resisting it, I
suppose he or she (assuming that any Vanity Fair feelings subsist in the
sphere whither we are bound) would have a pang of mortification at finding
how soon or survivors were consolced. And so Sir lPitt was forgotten-
like the kindest and best of us-only a few weeks sooner.
Those who will may follow his reins to the grave, whither they were
borne on the appointed day, in the most becoming manner, the family in
black coaches, with their hnndkerchiefs up to their noses, ready for the
tears which did not come: the undertaker and his gentlemen in deep
tribulation : the select tenantry mourning out of compliment to the new
landlord: the neighbouring gently's carriages nt three miles an hour,
empty, and in profound ebullition: the parson speaking out the formula
not `` our lear brother departed,'' As long as we have a man's body,

ivor not to give way to grief, and informing them in the most respectful
terms that they also would be one day called upon to pass that gloomy
and mysterious portal which he just closed upon the remains of their
lamented brother. Then the tenantry mounted on horseback again, or
stayed and refreshed themselves at the Crawled Arms. Then, after a
lunch in the servant's hall at ucen's Crawled, the entry's carriages
wheelel off to their different destination: then the undertaker's men,
taking the ropes, walls, velvet, stretch feathers, and other mortuary pro-
parties, clambered up on the roof of the hears, and rode off to South-
ampton. Their faces relapsed into a natural expression as the horses,
clearing the lodge-gates, got into a brisk trot on the open road; and

pointer used to how sometimes at first, but these were the only accents of
grief which were heard in the Hall of which Sir Pitt Crawled, Baronet, had
been master for some three-score years.
As the birds were pretty plentiful, and partridge-shooting is as it were
the duty of an English gentleman of statesman-like propensities, Sir Pitt
Crawled, the first shock of grief over, went out a little and cartoon of that
diversion in a white hat with a crape round it. The sight of those fields
of stubble and turmnips, now his own, gave him many secret joys. Some-
times, and with an exquisite humility, he took no gun, but went out with
a peaceful bamboo cane; Rawdon, his big brother, and the keepers blazing
away at his side. Pitt's money and acres had a great effect upon his
brother. The penniless Colonel became quite obsequious and respectful
to the head of his house, and despised the milk-sop Pitt no longer.
Rawdon listened with sympathy to his senior's prospects of planting and
draining: gave his advice about the stables and cattle, rode over to Mud-
bury to look at n mare which he thought would carry Lady Jane, and
offered to break her: &c: the rebellious dragoon was quite humbled and
subdued, and became a most creditable younger brother. He had constant
bulletins from Miss Brings in London respecting little Pardon, who was
left behind there: who sent messages of his own. ``I am very well,'' he
wrote. I hope you are very well. I hope MAmma is very well. The
pony is very well. Grey takes me to ride in the Park. I can canter.
I not the little boy who rose before. He cried when he austere. I do
not cry.'' Rawdon real these letters to his brother, and Lady Jane, who
was delighted with them. The Baronet promised to take charge of the
lad at school; and his kind-hearted wife gave Rebecca a bank-note, beg-
ring her to buy a present with it for her little nephew.
One day followed another, and the ladies of the house passed their life
in those calm pursuits and amusements which satisfy country ladies.
Bells rang to meals, and to prayers. The young ladies took exercise on
the piano-forte every morning after breakfast, Rebecca giving them the
benefit of her instruction. Then they put on thick shoes and walked in
the park and shrubberies, or beyond the palings into the village, descending
upon the cottages, with Lady Southdown's medicine and tracts for the
sick people there. Lady Southdown drop out in a pony-chaise, when
kebeccs would take her place by the Widower's side, and listen to her
solemn talk with the utmost interest. She sang Handle and Haydn to
the family of evenings, and engaged in a large piece of worsted work, as
if she had been born to the business, and as if this kind of life was to
continue with her until she should sink to the grave in a polite old age,
leaving regrets and a great quantity of console behind her-as if there were
not cares and dust, schemes, shifts, and poverty, waiting outside the Park
gates, to pounce upon her when she issued into the world again.
It isn't difficult to be a country gentleman's wife,'' Rebecca thought.
I think I could be a good woman if I had fie thousand a year. I could
middle about in the nursery, and count the apricots on the wall. I could
water plants in a green-house, and pick off dead leaves from the geraniums.

worth of soup for the poor. I shouldn't miss it much, out of five thou-

and dress in the fashion of the year before last. I could go to church
and keep awake in the great family pew: or go to sleep behind the
curtains, and with my veil down, if I only had practice. I could pay
everybody, if I had but the money. This is what the conjurors here
pride themselves upon doing. They look down with pity upon us miserable
sinners who had none. hey think themselves generous if they give our
children n five-pound note, and us contcmptible if we are without one.''

was only a question of money and fortune which made the difference
between her and an honest woman If you take tcemptations into account,
who is to say that he is better than his neighbour? A comfortable career
of prosperity, if it does not make people honest, at last keeps them so.

The old haunts, the old fields and wools, the copses, ponds and garden,
the rooms of the old house where she had spent a couple of years seven
years ago, were all carefully revisited by her. She had been young there
or comparatively so, for she forgot the time when she ever was young-
but she remembered her thoughts and feelings seven years back, and con-
tasted them with those which she had at present, now that she had seen
the world and live with great people, and raised herself far beyond her
original humble station.
I have passed beyond it because I have brains,'' Beck thought,
`and almost all the rest of the world are fools. I could not go back, and
consort with those people now, whom I used to meet in my father's studio.
Lords come up to my door with stars und gurters instead of poor artists
with screws of tobacco in their pockets. I have a gentleman for my
husband, and an eArl's daughter for my sister in the very house where I

it was in those- securities that she would have liked to cast anchor.
It may, perhaps, have struck her that to have been honest and humble,
to have done her duty, and to have marched straightforward on her way,
would have brought her as near happiness as that path by which she was
striving to attain it. But,-just as the children at Queen's Crawled went
round the room, where the body of their father lay ;-if ever Beck had
these thoughts, she was accustomed to walk round them, and not look in.
She eluded them, and despised them-or at least she was committed to
the other path from which retreat was now impossible. And for my part
I believe that remorse is the least active of all a man's moral senses-the

Very easiest to be deadened when wakened: and in some never wakened

ment; but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people unhappy in
Vanity Fair.
So Rebecca, during her stay at queen's Crawled, made as many friends
of the Common of Unrighteousuess as she could possibly bring under
control. Lady Jane and her husband bade her farewell with the warmest
demonstrations of good will. They looked forward with pleasure to the
time when the family-house in Gaunt Street being repaired and beautified;
they were to meet again in London. Lady Southdown made her up a
packet of medicine, and sent a letter by her to the Red, Lswrence Grills,
exlorting that gentleman to save the brand who ``honoured'' the letter
from the burning. Pitt accompanied them with four horses in the carriage
toMudbury, having sent on their baggage in a cart previously, accompanied
with bonds of game.
 How happy you will be to see your darling little boy again,'' Lady
Crawled said, taking leave of her kinswoman.
O so happy l'' said Rebecca, throwing up the green eyes. She was
immensely happy to be free of the place, and yet loth to go. queen's
Crawled was abominably stupid; and yet the air there was somehow
purer than that which she had been accustomed to breathe. Everybody
had been dull, but hnl been kind in their way. ``It is all the influence of a

likely.
Iiowvever, the London lamps flashed joyfully as the stage rolled into
Piccadilly, and Brings had made a beautiful fire in Curzon Street, and
little Rawdon was up to welcome back his papa and mamma.

WE'
ONSIDFERAII.E time has elapsed since we have seen
our respectable friend, old Mr, Osbomne of Russet
Square. He has not been the happiest of mortals
since last we met him. Events have occurred which
have not improved his temper, and in more instances
than one he has not been allowed to have his own
way. To e started in this reasonable desire was
always very injurious to the old gentleman; and
resistance became doubly exasperating when gout,
age, loneliness, and the force of my disappoiut-
meets combined to weigh him down. His stiff black hair began to grow
quite white soon after his son's death; his face grew redder; his hands them-
bled more and more as he poured out his glass of port wine. lIe led his
clerks a dire life in the city: his family at home were not much happier.
I doubt if Rebccca, whom we have seen piously praying for Console,
would have exchanged her poverty and the dure-devil excitement and
chances of her life, for Shore's money and the human gloom which
envelope him. He had proposed for Miss Swartz, but had been rejected
scornfully by the partisans of that lady, who married her to a young spring
of Scotch nobility. He was a man to he married a woman out of low
life, and buried her dreadfully afterwards: but no person presented herself
suitable to his taste; and instead, he tyrannise over his untnarricl daughter
at home. She had a fine carriage and fine horses, and sat at the head of
a table loaded with the grandest plate. She had a cheque-book, n prize
footman to follow her when she walked, unlimited credit, and bows and
compliments from all the tradesmen, and all the appurtenacees of an
express; but she spent n woful time. The little charity-girls at the Found-
long, the sweeperess at the crossing, the poorest under-kitchen-maid in the
servant's hall, was happy compared to that unfortunate and now middle-
aged young lady.
Rendered Bullock, Esq., of the house of Bullock, Her, and Bullock, hal
married aria Borne, not without a great deal of difficulty and grumbling
on Mr. Bullock's part. George being dead and cut out of his father's
will, Frederic insisted that the half of the old gentleman's property should
be settled upon his Mnria, and indeed, for a long time, refused ' to come to
the scratch'' (it is Mr. Frelerick's own expression) on any other terms.
Borne said Free had agreed to take his daughter with twenty thousand,
and he should bind himself tone more.  TIred might take it, and welcome,

when George had been disinherited, thought himself infamously swindled
by the old merchant, and for some time made as if he would break off the
match altogether. Osbomne withdrew his account from Bullock and
Hunger's, went on Change with a horsewhip which he swore he would as
across the back of a certain scoundrel that should be nameless, and
remained himself in his usual violent manner. Jane Borne consoled
with her sister Maria during this family feud. ``I always told you,
Mnria, that it was your money he loved, all not you,'' she said soothingly.
He selected me and my money at any rate: he didn't choose you and

partners counselled him to take MIaria, even with the twenty thousand
settled, half down, and half at the death of Mr. Borne, with the chances
of the further division of the property. So he ``knuckled down,'' again
to use his own phrase; and sent old Hunger with peaceable overturesto
Borne. I was his father, he said, who would not hear of the match,
and had made the difficulties; he was most anxious to keep the engage-
ment. The excuse was sulkily accepted by Mr. Borne. Hunger and
Bullock were a high family of the city aristocracy, and connected with the
sobs'' at the West End. It was something for the old man to be able to
say `MY son, Sir, of the house of IIulker, Bullock, and Co., Sir; my laugh-
her's cousin, Lady MIry COming, Sir, daughter of the Right Hand. the eArl
of Castlemeuldy.'' In lis imagination he saw his house peopled by the
``sobs.'' So he forgave young Bullock, and consented that the marriage
should take place.
It was a grand affair-the bridegroom's relatives giving the breakfast,
their habitations being near St. George's Hanover Square, where the
business took place. The ``sobs of the West End,'' were invited, and
many of them signal the book. Mr. Man and Lady Mary Man were
there, with the dear young Gwendoline and Whenever MAking as brides-
maids; Colonel Plunder of the Dragoon Guards (eldest son of the house
of Louder Brothers, Mincing Blue), another cousin of the bridegroom,
and the Honourable Mrs. Louder; the Honourable George Boulter, Lord
Leant's son, and his lady, Miss Woman that was; Lord Viscount Castle-
todly; Honourable James McMull and Mrs. MeMIull (formerly Miss
Swartz), and a host of faslionables, who he all married into Lonbard
Street, and done a great deal to ennoble Cornhill.
The young couple had a house near Berkeley Square, an a small villa at
Roehampton, among the banging colony there. Free was considered to
have made rather a mnesalliauece by the ladies of his family, lose grand-
father had been in a Charity School, and who were allied through th
husbands with some of the best blood in England. And Maria was
bound, by superior pride and great care in the composition of her visiting-
book, to make up for the defects of birth; and felt it her duty to see the
father and sister as little as possible.
That she should utterly break with the old man, who had still so many
scores of thousand pounds to gie away, is absurd to suppose. Feel
Bullock would never all her to do that. But she was still young and

her third-rate parties, and having very coldly to them when they came,
and by avoiding Trusser Square, and indiscreetly begging her father to quit
that odious vulgar place; she did more harm than all Frederick's daily-
may could repair, and thrilled her chance of her inheritance like a giddy
heedless creature as she was.
So Cruelly Square is not good enough for Mrs. Marias, hay?'' said
the old gentleman, rattling up the carriage-windows, as he and his daughter
drove away one night from MIss. Frederick Bullock's, after dinner. `` So
she invites her father and sister to a second day's dinner (if those sides, or
nature, as she calls 'am, weren't served yesterday, I'm d-l), and to meet
City folks and litter men, and keeps the Curls, and the Ladies, and the
Honourable to herself. Honoursblcs? Damp Honourable. I am a
plain British merchant I am: and could buy the begguarly hounds over

speak to n dam tiddler-a fellar I despise. And they won't come to
Brussels Square, won't they Why, I 'I1 by my life I've got a better
glass of wine, and pay a better figure for it, and can show a handsomer
service of silver, and in any a better dinner on my mahogany, than ever
they see on theirs-the ringing, speaking, stuck-up fools. Drive on
quick, James; I want to get back to Brussels Square-ha, hal'' and he
sank back into the corner with a furious laugh. With such reflections on
his own superior merits, it was the custom of the old gentleman not
unfrequently to console himself.
Jane Borne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her
sister's conduct; and when Mrs. Frederiek's first-born, Fredcric August
Howard Stanley Devereux Bullock, was born, old Osbomne, who was
invited to the christening and to be godfather, contented himself with
sending the child a gold cup, with twenty guineas inside it for the nurse.
That's more than any of your Lords will give, I 'll arrant,'' he said,
and refused to attend at the ceremony.
The splendour of the gift, however, caused great satisfaction to the
house of Bullock. Maria thought that her father was very much pleased
with her, and Frederic laughed the best for his little son and heir.
One can fancy the pangs with which Miss Borne in her solitude in
Trusses Square read the ' Morning Post,'' where her sister's name occurred
every now and then, in the articles ended '' Fushionable Reunion,'' and
where she had an opportunity of reading a description of Mrs, F. Bulloek's
costume, when presented at the drawing-room by Lady Frederica Bulloek.
Anne's own life, as we have said, admitted of no such grandeur. It was an
awful existence. She had to get up of black winter's mornings to make
breakfast for her scowling old father, who would have turned the whole
house out of doors if his ten had not been ready at halti-past eight. She
remained silent opposite to him, listening to the urn hissing, and sitting in
tremor while the parent read his paper, and consumed his accustomed
portion of puffing and tea. At half-past nine he rose and went to the
City, and she was almost free till dinner-time, to make visitations in the
kitchen and to scold the servants: to drive round and descend upon the
tradesmen, who were prodigiously respectful : to leave her cards and her
papa's at the great glum respectable houses of their City friends; or to sit

VANITY FAIR.
alone in the large drawing-to, expecting visitors; and working at a
huge piece of worsted by the fire, on the sofa, hard by the great lIpligenia
locks, which tieked and tolled with mournful loudness in the dreary room.
The great glass over the mantel-piece, faced by the other great console
glass at the opposite end of the room, increased and multiplied between
them the brown holland bag in which the chandelier hung; until you saw
these brown Holland bags fading away in endless perspectives, and this apart-
ment of Miss Borne's seemed the centre of a system of drawing-rooms.
When she removed the cordoan leather from the grand piano, and even-
turned to play a few notes o it, it sounded with a mournful sadness,
startling the dismal echoes of the house. George's picture was gone, and
laid up-stairs in a lumber-room in the garret; and though there was a
consciousness of him, and father and daughter often instinctively knew
that they were thinking of him, no mention was ever made of the bare
and once during son.
At five o'clock Mr. Borne came back to his dinner, which he and his
daughter took in silence (seldom broken, except when he swore and was
savage, if the cooking was not to his liking), or which they shared twice in
a month with a party of dismal friends of Borne's rank and age. Old
r. Gulp and his lady from Bloosbury queer: old Mr. Flowers, the
attorney, from lBedford Low, a very great man, and from his business,
hand-in-love with the ``sobs at the WEst End :'' old Colonel Livermore, of
the Botany Ary, and Mrs. Livermore, from Upper Before Place  old
Berjeant of and Mrs. Toffy ; and sometimes old Sir Thomas Coffin and
Lady Coffin, from Before Square. Sir `Thomas was celebrated as a
hanging judge, and the particular tawny port was produced when he dined
with Mr. Borne.
These people and their like gave the pompous Trusser Square merchant
pompous dinners back again. They had solemn rubbers of whist, when
they went up-stairs after drinking, and their carriages were called at half-
past ten. Many rich people, whom we poor devils are in the habit of
cnvying, lend contentedly an existence like that above described. Jane
Borne scarcely ever met n man under sixty, and almost the only bachelor
who appeared in their society was Mr. Smirk, the celebrated Lady'doctor.
I can't say that nothing had occurred to disturb the monotony of this
awful existence : the fact is, there had been a secret in poor lane's life
which had made her father more savage and more than even nature,
pride, and over-feeding had made him. This secret was connected with
Miss Wit, who had n cousin an artist, MIr. See, very celebrated since as
a portrait-painter and In,A., but who once was glad enough to give
drawing-lessons to ladies of fashion. Mr. She has forgotten where Us-
sell Square is now, but he was glad enough to visit it in the year 1818,
when Miss Borne had instruction from him.
See (formerly n pupil of sharp of Frith Street, a dissolute, irregular,
and unsuecessful me, but a man with great knowledge of his art) being
the cousin of Miss WIth, we say, and introduced by her to Miss Borne,
whose hand and heart were still free after various ineomplete love affairs,
felt a great attachment for this lady, and it is believed inspired one in her
bosom. Miss Wit was the confidante of this intrigue. I know not
A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERO.
383
whether she used to leave the room where the master and his pupil were
painting, in order to give them an opportunity for exchanging those vows
and sentiments which cannot be uttered advantageously in the presence of
a third party: I know not whether she hoped that should her cousin
succeed in carrying off the rich merchant's daughter, he would give Miss
Wit a portion of the wealth, which she had enabled him to win-all that
is certain is, that Mr, Borne got some hint of the transaction, come
back from the City abruptly, and entered the drawing-room with his
bamboo cane; found the painter, the pupil, and the companion all looking
exceedingly pale there; turned the former out of doors with menace that
he would break every bone in his skin, and half-an-hour afterwards dis-
missed Miss Wit likewise, kicking her trunks down the stairs, trampling on
her and-boxes, and shaking is fist at her lackney coach, as it bore her
away.
Jane Borne kept her her-room for many days. She was not allowed
to have a companion afterwards. Her father swore to her that she should
not have a shilling of his money if she made any match without his con-
current; and as he wanted a woman to keep his house, he did not choose
that she should marry : so that she was obliged to give up all projects
with which Cupid had any share. During her papa's life, then, she resigned
herself to the manner of existence here described, and was content to be
an Old Maid. Her sister, meanwhile, was having children with finer names
eery year-and the intercourse between the two grew faintcr continually.,
``Jane and I do not move in the same sphere of life,'' Mrs. Bullock said.
 I regard her as a sister, of course''-which means-what does it mean
when a lady says that she regards Jane as a sister
It has been described how the Misses Doing lived with their father at
a fine villa nt Remarks Hill, where there were beautiful graperies and
peach-trees which delighted little George Osborue. The Misses Doing,
who drove often to Brompton to see our dear Amelia, came sometimes to
Brussels Square too, to pay a visit to their old acquaintance Miss Borne.
I believe it was in consequence of the commands of their brother the Major
in India (or whom their papa had a prodigious respect), that they played
attention to Mrs. George; for the Moor, the godfather and guardian of
Amelia's little boy, still hoped that the child's grandfather might be
induced to relent towards him, and acknowledge him for the sake of his
son. The Miss Dobbins kept Miss Borne acquainted with the state of
Amelia's affairs; how she was living with her father and mother: how
poor they were : how they wondered what men, and such men as their
brother and dear Captain Borne, could find in such an insignificant little
chit: how she was still, as heretofore, a name-play milk-and-water
affected creature-but how the boy was really the noblest little boy ever
seen-for the hearts of all women warm towards young children, and the
surest spinster is kind to them.
One day, after great entreaties, on the part of the Misses Doing, Amelia
allowed little George to go and pass a day with them at Remarks STill-a
part of which day she spent herself in writing to the Msjor in Indin. She
congratulated him on the happy news which his sisters had just conveyed

to her. She prayed for his prosperity, and that of the bride he had chosen.
She thanked him for a thousand thousand kind offices and proofs of step-
fast friendship to her in her affliction. She told him the last news about
little George, and how he was gone to spend that very day with his sisters
in the country. She underlined the letter a great deal, and she signed
herself affectionately his friend, Amelia Borne. She forgot to send any
message of kindness to Lady O'Down, as her wont was-and did not
mention Glowing by name, and only in italian, as the Mayor's ride, for
whom she begged lessings. But the news of the marriage removed the
reserve which she had kept up towards him. She was glad to be able to
own and feel how warmly and gratefully she regarded him-and as for the
idea of being jealous of Glorvina, (Glorvina, indeed) Amelia would have
scouted it, is an angel from heaven had hinted it to her.
That night, when George came back in the pony-carriage in which he
rejoiced, and in which he was driven by Sir We. Doing's old coachman,
he had round his neck a fine gold chain and watch. He said an old lady,
not pretty, had given it him, who cried and kissed him a great deal. Bit
he didn't like her. He liked grapes very much. Ad he only liked his
mamma. Amelia shrunk and started: the timid soul felt a presentiment
of terror when she heard that the relations of the child's father had
seen him.
Miss Borne came back to give her father his dinner. He had made
a good speculation in the City, and was rather in a good humour that day,
and chanced to remark the agitation under which she laboured. ee What's
the matter, Miss OsborneP'' he deigned to say.
The woman burst into tears. ` O, Sir,'' she said,  I've seen little
George. He is as beautiful as an angel-and so like him' The old man
opposite to her did not say a word, but flushed up, and began to tremble
in every limb.

our guallant old friends of the -th

and heat have not diminished the
activity or the eloquence of the de-

ance, is as much at home at Stairs as at Brussels, in the atonement as
under the tents. On the march you saw her at the head of the regiment
seated on a royal elephant, a noble sight. Mounted on that beast, she has
been into action with tigers in the jingle: she has been received by native
princes, who have welcomed her and Glorvina into the recesses of their
enfants and offered her shawls and jewels which it went to her her to
refuse. The sentries of all arms snlute her wherever she makes her appear-
once: and she touches her hat gravely to their salutation. Lady O'Down
is one of the greatest lilies in the residence of Madame-her quarrel with
Lady Smith, wife of Sir Minds Smith the pause judge, is still remembered
by some at Madame, when the Colonel's lady snapped her fingers in the
Judge's lady's face, and said she'd never stir a foot before ever a beggarly
civility. Even now, though it is five-and-twenty years ago, people seem-

Perry O'Down is indeed the same as ever: kind in act and thought:
impetuous in temper; eager to command: a tyrant over her Michael: a
dragon amongst all the ladies of the regiment : a mother to all the young
men, her she ends in their sickness, legends in all their grapes, and with
him Lady l'gay is immensely popular. But the Subalterns' and Captain'
ladies (the Major is unmarried) could against her a good deal. lie so
that Glorvina gives herself airs, and that Perry herself is intolerably you-
nearing. The interfered with a little congregation which Mrs. Kick had got
up, and laughed the young men away from her sermons, setting that a
soldier's wife had no business to be a parson: that Mrs. Kick would
be much better mending her husband's clothes: and, if the regiment
wanted sermons, that she had the finest in the world, those of her uncle,
the dEad. She abruptly put a termination to a flirtation which Lieutenant
Stubble of the regiment had commenced with the Surgeon's wife, threatening
to come down upon Stable for the money which he had borrowed from
her (for the young fellow was still of an cxtravgant turn) unless e broke
off at once and went to the Cane, on sick leave. On the other hand,
she housed and sheltered Mrs. sky who fled from her bungalow one
night, pursued by her infuriate husband, yielding his second brandy
bottle, and actually married Posky through the delirium tremens, and broke
him of the habit of drinking, which had grown upon that oficer as all evil
habits ill grow upon men. In a word, in adversity she was the best of
comforters, in good fortune the most troublesome of friends; having a
perfectly good opinion of herself always, and un indomitable resolution to
have her own way.
Among other points, she had made up her mind that Glorvina should
marry our old friend Doing, MRs. O'Down knew the Moor's expect-
lions and appreciate lis good qualities, and the high character which he
enjoyed in his profession. Glorvina, a very handsome, freshcoloured,
black-haired, blue-eyed young lady, who could ride a horse, or play a sonatta
with any girl out of the County Dark, seemed to be the very person destined
to ensure Doing's happiness-much more than that poor good little weak-
spur'ted Amelia, about whom he used to take on so.-'` Look at Glorvina
enter na room,'' Mrs. O'Down would say, '`and compare her with that
poor Mrs. Borne, who couldn't say so to a goose. She'd be worthy of
you, Major-you're a quiet man yourself, and want some one to talk for
ye. And though she does not come of such good blood as the Balcony
or Follows, let me tell me, she's of an ancient family that any nobleman
might be proud to marry into.''
But before she had come to such a resolution, and determined to sob-
gate Major Doing by her endearments, it must be owned that Glorvina
lmal practised them a good deal elsewhere. She had had a season in
Public, and who knows how many in Cork, Killarney, and Mellow She
nd flirted with all the marriageable officers whom the depths of her
country afforded, and all the bachelor squires who seemed eligible. She

clergyman t Bath who used her so ill. She hal flirted all the way to
Dreams with the Captain and chief-mate of :he llamclunder Best Iudiaman,
and had a season at the Residence with her brother and MRs, O'Down
who was staying there, while the Mayor of the regiment as in command
at the station. Everybody admired her there: evcryoy danced with
her: but no one proposed who was worth the marrying; one or two exceed-
ingly young subalterns sighed after her, and a heardless civility or two;
but she rejected these as beneath her pretensions; and other and younger
virgins than Glorvinn were married before her. There are women, and
handsome women too, who have this fortune in life. They fall in love
with the utmost generosity ; they ride and walk with half the Ary-list,
though they mrs near to forty, and yet the MIss O'Gradys are Miss
O'Always still : Glorvina persisted that but for Lady O'Down's unlucky
arrel with the Judge's lady, she would have made a good match t
Dreams, where old Mr, Chimney, who was at the head of the civil service,
(and who afterwards married Miss Only, a young holy, only thirteen
years of age, who led just arrived from school in eUrope), was just at the
point of proposing to her.
Well, although Lady O'Down and Glorvina quaellel a great number
of times every day, and upon almost every conceivable subject-since, if
Milk O'Down had not possessed the temper of an age, two such women
constantly about his ears would have driven him on of his senses-yet
they agreed between themselves on this point, that dlorvina should marry
Major Doing, and were determined that the Major should have no rest
until thearrangement was brought about. Undismayel by forty or fifty
previous defeat, Glorvina laid siege to him. She sang Irish Alelotlies at
him nnceasingly. She asked him so frequently and patletically, will ye
come to the bower? that it is a wonder how any man of feeling could
have resisted the invitation. She was never tired of inquiring, if Sorrow
had his young days failed; and was ready to listen and weep like
bDesdemoaat the stores of his duangers and his cnmpaigns. It has been
said that our honest and dear old friend used to perform on the flute in
private: Glervi insisted upon having duet with him, and LAdy O'bRown
would rise and restlessly quit the room, when the young couple were so
engaged. Glorvina forced the Moor to ride with her of mornings. The
whole cantonment saw them set out and return. She was constantly
writing notes over to him at his house, borrowing his books, and scouring
with her great pencil-marks no pa-ages of sentiment or humour as
awakened her sympathy. in borrowed his horses, his servants, his
spoons, and planning;-no wonder that public rumour assigned her to
him, and thither MIajor's sisters in England should fancy they were about
to have a sister-last.
Doing, who was thus yigorously besieged, was in the meanwhile in a
state of the most odious trinquility. He used to laugh when the young
fellows of the regimet joked him about Glorvina's munifest attentions to
him. t Bah1'' said he, '`she is only keeping her hand in-she practises
upon me as she does upon Mrs. Tower's piano, because it's the most
handy instrument in the station. I am much too battered and old for
such a fine young lady s Glorious.'' And so he went on riding with her,
c c 2

and copying music and verses into her albums, and playing at chess with
her very submissively; for it is with these simple amusements that some
officers in India are accustomed to while away their leisure moments;
while others of a less domestic turn hunt dogs, and shoot snipes, or
gamble and smoke cheroots, and bctake themselves to brandy-and-water.
As for Sir Michael O'Down, though his Lady and her sister both urged
him to call upon the Major to explain himself, and not keep on torture-
ing a poor innocent girl in that shameful way; the old soldier refused
point-blank to have anything to do with the conspiracy- 'Faith, the
Mayor's big enough to choose for himself,'' Sir Michael said; `' he'll ask ye
when he wants ye;''-or else he would turn the matter off jocularly,
declaring '`that Doing was too young to keep house, and had written
home to ask leave of his mamma.'' Any, he went farther, and in private
commnunications with his Msjor, would cution and rally him-crying,
Mind your of, Do, my hoy, them girls is bent on mischief-me Lady
as just got a box of gowns from europe, and there 's a pink satin for
Glorvina, which will finish ye Do, if it 's in the power of woman or satin
to move ye.''
But the truth is, neither beauty nor fashion could conquer him. Our
ones friend had but one idea of a woman in his head, and that one did
not in the least resemble Miss Georgina O'Down in pink satin. A gentle
little woman in black, with large eyes and brown hair, seldom speaking,
save when spoken to, and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss
Glorvinn's-a soft young mother tending an infant and beckoning the
Mnjor up with a smile to look at him-a rosy-checked lass coming sing-
ing into the room in Trusses Square or hanging on George Borne's
arm happy and loving-there was but this image that filled our
honest Major's mind by day and by night and reigned over it always.
Very likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Moor and formed of her 
there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in england,
and with which William had made away privately, pasting it into the lid
of his desk, and faneying he saw some resemblance to Mrs. Borne in
the print, whereas 1 have seen it, and can vouch that it is but the picture
of a high-waistel gown with an impossible doll's face simpering over it-
nun, perhaps, Mr. Doing's sentimental Amelia was no more like the real
one than this absurd little print which he cherished. But what man in
love, of us, is better informed -or is he much happier when he sees and
owns his delusion Doing was under this spell. He did not bother his
friends and the public much about his feelings, or indeed lose his natural
zest or appetite on account of them. His head has grizzled since we saw
him last; and a line or two of silver may be seen in the soft brown hair
likewise. But his feelings are not in the least changed or opened; and
his love remains as fresh, as a man's recollections of boyhood are.
WE have said how the two Miss Dobbins and Mmelia, the Moors
zorrespondeuts in Europe, wrote him letters from England; Mrs. Borne
congratuluting him with great candour and cordiality upon his approaching
nuptials with MIss O'Down.

``and informed me of an interesting been, upon which I beg to offer my

on in this strain, protesting throughout as to the extreme satisfaction of
the writer.

This letter, which arrive by the very same slip which brought out Lady
O'Down's box of millinery from London, (and which you may be sure Dobin
 opened before any one of the other packets which the mail brought him),
put the receiver into such a state of mind that Glorvina, and her pink
satin, and everything belonging to her became perfectly odious to him.
The Msjor cursed the talk of women : and the sex in general. Every-
thing annoyed him that day-the parade was insufferably hot and were-
some. Good heavens was a man of intellect to waste his life, day after

MANY FAIR.
day, inspecting cross-belts, and putting fools through their manaeuvres
The senseless chatter of the young men t mess was more than her jarring.
What cared he, a man on the high road to forty, to know how many
snipes Lieutenant Smith had shot, or what were the performances of
Lnsign Brown's mare The jokes about the table filled him with shame.
He was too old to listen to the banter of the assistant-surgeon and the
slang of the youngsters, at which old O'Down, with his hand head and
red face, laughed quite easily. The old man had listened to those jokes
any time these thirty years-Doing himself had been fifteen years hearing
them. And after the boisterous dulness of the mess-table, the quarrels
and scanned of the ladies of the regimentl It was unbearable, shameful.
tO Amelia, Anelia,'' he thought, `` you to whom I have been so faithful,-
you reproach me It is because you cannot feel for me, that I drag on
this wearisome life. And you reward me after years of devotion by
giving me your blessing upon my marriage, forseooth, with this counting
Irish girl'' Sick and sorry felt poor William: more than ever wretched
and lonely. He would like to have done with life and its vanity also-
gather-so bootless and unsatisfactory the struggle, so cheerless and dreary
the prospect, seemed to him. He lay all that night sleepless, and yearn-
ing to go home. Amelia's letter had fallen as a blank upon him. No
fidelity, no constant truth and passion, could move her into warmth. She
could not see that he loved her. Tossing in his bed, he spoke out to
her. ``good God, Hamlin'' he said, ``don't you know that I only love
you in the world-you, who are a stone to me-you, whom I tended
through months and months of illness and grief, and who bade me fare-
well with a smile on your face, and forgot me before the door shut between
us1'' The native servants lying outside his verandahs beheld with
wonder the MIajor, so cold and quiet ordinarily, at present so passionately
moved and cast down. Would she have pitied him had she seen him?
He read over and over all the letters which he ever and from her-letters
of business relative to the little property which he had made her believe
her husband had left to her-brief notes of invitation-every scrap of
writing that she had ever sent to him-how cold, how kind, how hope-
less, how selfish, they were
Had there been some kind gentle soul near at hand who could read and
appreciate this silent generous heart, who knows but that the reign of Amelia
might have been over, and that friend William's love might have flowed
into a kinder channel But there was only Glorvina of the jetty ringlets
with whom lis intercourse was familiar, and this dashing young woman
was not bent upon loving the MInor, but rather on making the Major
admire er-a most vain and hopeless task too, at least considering the
means that the poor girl possessed to carry it out. She curled her hair
and showed her shoulders at him, as much as to say, did ye ever see such
jet ringlets and such a complexion sHe grinned at him so that he might
see that every tooth in her hand was sound-and he never heeded all
these charms. Very soon after the arrival of the box of millinery, and
perhaps since in honour of it, LAdy O'Down and the ladies of the King's
Regiment gave a ball to the Company's Regiment and the civilised at

the station. Glorvina sported the killing pink frock, and the Mayor, who
attended the party and walked very ruefully up and down the rooms,
never so much as perceived the pink garment. Glowing danced past him
in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station, and the Moor was
not in the least jealous of her performance, or angry because Captain
Bnngles of the Calvary handed her to supper. - It was not jealousy, or
frocks or shoulders, that could move him, and Glories had nothing
more.
So these two were each exemplifying the Vanity of this life, and each
longing for what he or she could not get. Glorvina cried with rage at
the failure. She had set her mind on the Maijor ``more than on any of
the others,'' she owned, sobbing. "` He 'll break my heart, he will, Perry,''
she would whimper to her sister-in-law when they were good friends;
`` sure every one of me frocks must be taken in-it's such a skeleton I 'm
growing.'' Fat or thin, Anything or melancholy, on horseback or the
music-stool, it was all the same to the Major. And the Colonel, puffing
his pipe and listening to these complaints, would suggest that Glory
should have some black frocks out in the next box from London, and told
a mysterious story of a lady in Ireland who died of grief for the loss of
her husband before she got ere a one.''
While the MInor as going on in this tantalizing way, not proposing,
and declining to fall in love, there came another ship from europe bringing
letters on board, and amongst them some more for the heartless man.
These were home letters bearing no earlier post mark than that of the former
packets, and as Major Doing recognised among his, the handwriting of
his sister, who always crossed and crossed her letters to her brother,
--gathered together all the possible bad news which she could collect,
abuse him and rend him lectures with sisterly frankness, and always left
him miserable for the day after '' dearest William'' had achieved the peru-
sal of one of her epistles-the truth must be told that, nearest William
did not him himself to break the seal of Miss Doing's letter, but waited
for a particularly favourable day and cool for doing so. A fortnight
before, moreover, he had written to scold her for telling those absurd
stories to MRs. Scorned, and had despatched a letter in reply to that lady,
undeceiving her with respect to the reports concerning him, and assuring
her that '` he had no sort of present intention of altering his condition.''
Two or three nights after the arrival of the second packnge of letters, the
Moor hnl passed the evening pretty cheerfully at Lady O'Down's house,
where Glorvina thought that he listened with rather more attention than
usual to the Meeting of the Waters, the MIinsthrel Boy, and one or two
other specimens of song with which she favoured him, (the truth is, he was
no more listening to Glorvina that to the howling of the jnuckalls in the
moonlight outside, and the delusion was her's as usual,) and having
played his game at chess with her, (cribbage with the surgeon was Lay
O'Down's favourite evening pastime,) Moor Behind took leave of the
Colonel's family at his usual hour, and retired to his own house.
There on his table, his sister's letter lay approaching him. DIe took
it up, ashamed rather of his negligence regarding it, and prepared
himself for a disagreeable hour's communing with that crabbed-handed

. It my have been an hour after the MIrror's
departure from the Colonel's house-Sir Michael was sleeping the sleep of
the just; Glorvina had arranged her black ringlets in the innumerable
little bits of paper, in which it was her habit to confide then; Lady
(O'Down, too, had gone to her bed in the nuptial chamber, on the ground-
floor, and had tucked her musquito curtains round her fair form, when
the guard at the gates of the Commanding-officer's compound, beheld
MIsery Doings, in the moonlight, rushing towards the house with a swift
step and a very agitated countenance, and he passed the sentinel and
went up to the windows of the Colonel's bed-chamber,
O'Down-Colonel'' said Doing, and kept up a great shouting.

head too, from her window.
e What is it, Do, me boy'' said the Colonel, expecting there was a

with all the papillotes.

Colonel getting up, came out to parley with him.
In the postscript of Miss Doing's cross-letter-the Major hal just
come upon a paragraph, to the following effect :- I drove yesterday to
see your old acquaintance, Mrs. Borne. The wretched place they live at,

towards the child of your friend, lis erring and fulfilled son. And
Amelin will not be ill-disposed to give him up. The widow is consoled,

attachment which had been placed there as a
token of mourning for Sir Pitt Crawled's demise,
yet this heraldic emblem was in itself a very
splendid and gaudy piece of furniture, and all
the rest of the mansion became more brilliant
than it had ever been during the late baronet's
reign. The black outer-coating of the bricks was
removed and they appenrcl with a cheerful blush-
ing face streaked with white: the old bronze lion
of the knocker were gilt handsomely, the railings
painted, and the smallest house in Great Gaunt
Street, become the shortest in the whole quarter,
before the green leaves in lampshire had replaced
those following ones which were on the trees in
queen's Crawled avenue when old Sir Pitt Draw-
let passed under them for the last time.
MA little woman, with a carriage to correspond,
was perpetually seen about this mansion; an
elderly spinster, accompanied by a little boy,
also might be remarked coming thither daily.
It was Miss Brings and little Rawdon, whose busy-
ness it was to see to the inward revelation of Sir Pitt's house, to supcr-
intend the female band engaged in stitching the blinds and hangings, to
poke and rummages in the drawers and cupboards crammed with the dirty
relics and cougregated trumperies of a couple of generations of Lady
Crawled, and to take inventories of the china, the glass, and otle
properties in the closest and store-rooms.
Mrs. Hamlin Crawled was general-in-chief over these arrangements,
with full orders From Sir Pitt to sell, brter, confused, or present found-
sure : and she enjoyed herself not a little in an occupation which gave full
scope to her taste an ingenuity. The revelation of the house s detes-
mind upon when Sir Pitt came to ton in November to see his lyere.
and when he passed nearly a week in Curzon Street, under the roof of his
affectionate brother and sister.
He had put up at an hotel at first; but, Becks as soon as she heard of
the Baronet's arrival, went off alone to greet him, and returned in an hour
to Curzon Street with Sir Pitt in the carriage by her side. t ee see

were they pressed, so frankly and amiably offered. Beck seized Pitt'a
hand in a transport of gratitude when he agreed to come. `Thank you,''
she said, squeezing it, and looking into the Baronet's eyes, who blushed
good deal 'how happy this will make Rawdon.'' She bustled up about
to Pitt's bed-room, leading on the servants, who were carrying his trunks
thither. She came in herself laughing, with a coal-scuttle out of her

glance. Indeed, she was really and sincerely happy at having him for a
guest.
Beck made Rawdon dine out once or twice on business, while Pitt
stayed with them, and the Baronet passed the happy evening alone with
her and Brings. She went down stairs to the kitchen and actually cooked
little dishes for him.  Isn't it a good saslmi2'' she said;  I made it for

the wife of an emperor, and that to be skilful in domestic duties was
surely one of the most charming of woman's qualities,'' And Sir Pitt
thought with something like mortification of Lady Jane at home, and of a
certain pie which she had insisted upon king, and serving to him at
dinner-a most abominable pie.
Besides the smile, which was made of LOrd Stone's phesants from his
lordship's cottage of Stillbrook, Beck use her brother-in-law a bottle of
white wine, some that Rawdon had brought with him from France, and had
picked up for nothing, the little story-teller said; whereas the liquor was,

cellars, which brought fire into the Baronet's pallid cheeks and a grown into
his feeble frame.
Then, when he had drunk up the bottle of exit vi lanc she gave him
her hand and took him up to the drawing-room, and made him snug on
the sofa by the fire, and let him talk as she listened with the tenderest
kindly interest, sitting by him, and humming n shirt for her dear little
boy. Whenever Mrs. Rawdon wished to be particularly humble and
virtuous, this little shirt used to come out of her work-box. It had got
to be too small for Rawdon long before it was finished, though.
WEll, ebeccea listened to him, she talked to him, she sang to him, she
coaxed him, and huddled him, so that he found himself more and more
glad every day to get back from the lawyer's at Gray's Inn, to the blazing
fire in Curzon Street-a gladness in which the men of low likewise parti-
parted, for Pitt's harangues were of the longest-and so that when he
went away he felt quite a peg at departing. How pretty she looked
kissing her and to him from the carriage and waving her handkerchief
when he had taken his place in the mill She put the handkerchief to
her eyes once. lIe pulled his speaking cup over his, as the coach drove
away, and, sinking back, he thought to himself how she respected him and
how he deserved it, and low Rawdon was a foolish dull fellow who didn't
half appreciate his wife: and how mum and stupid his own wife was
compared to that brilliant little Beck. Beck had hinted every one of
these things herself, perhaps, but so delicately and gently, that you hardly
knew when or where. And, before they parted, it was agreed that the
house in London should be redecorated for the next season, and that the
brothers' families should meet again in the country at Christmas.
I wish you could have got  little money out of him,'' Rawdon said to
his wife moodily when the bAronet was gone. I should like to give
something to old Raggles, hanged if I should'not. It in'a right, you know,
that the old fellow should be kept out of all his money. It may be known-
venient, an he might let to somebody else besides us, you know.''
tEll him,'' said Beck, ``that as soon as Sir Pitt's affairs are settled,
everybody will be paid, and give him a little something on account.
Here's a clock that Pitt left for the boy,'' and she took from her bag and
gave her husband a paper which his brother and handed over to her, on
behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Trawlers.
The truth is, she had tried personally the ground on which her husband
expressed a wish that she should venture-tried it ever so delicately, and

found it unsafe. Been at a hint about embarrassments, Sir Pile Crawled
was off and alarmed. And he began a long speech, explaining how
straitened he himself was in money matters; how the tenants would not
pay; how lis there's affairs, and the expenses attendant upon the demise
of the old gentleman, had involved him; how he wanted to pay off since-
branches; and how the bankers and agents were overdruwn; and Pitt
Crawled ended by making a compromise with his sister-in-law, and giving
her a very small sum for the benefit of her little boy.
Pitt knew how poor his brother and his brother's family must be. It
could not have escaped the notice of such a cool and experienced old devil-
matter, that Rawson's family had nothing to live upon, and that houses
and carriages are not to be kept for nothing. He knew very well that he
was the proprietor or appropriator of the money, which, according to all
proper cnlculation, ought to have fallen to his younger brother, and he had,
we may be sure, some secret pangs of remorse within him, which warned
him that he ought to perform some act of justice, or, let us say, compeus-
lion, towards these disappointed relations. A just, decent an, not without
brains, who said his prayers, and knew his catechism, and did his duty
outwardly through life, he could not be otherwise than aware that some-
thing was due to his brother at his hands, and that morally he was
Newson's creditor.
But, as one ends in the columns of the Ones newspaper every now
and then, queer announcements from the Chancellor of the Chequers,
Icknowledging the receipt of E50 from A. B., or El0 from W. T., as
conscience-money, on account of takes due by the said A. B. or BY. T.,
which payment the penitent beg the Right Honourable gentleman to
acknowledge through the medium of the public press;-so is the Chain-
cellor no doubt, and the reader likewise, always perfectly sure that the
love-named A. B. and A', T, are only paying a very small instrument
of what they really owe, and that the man who sends up a twenty pound-
note has very likely hundreds or thousands more for which he ought to
necount. Such, at least, are my feelings, when I see A. B. or W. T.'a
insuflicient acts of repentance. And I have no doubt that Pitt Craven's
contrition, or kindness if you will, towards his younger brother, by whom
he had so much profited, was only a very small divided upon the capital
sum in which he was indebted to Rawdon. Not everybody is willing to
pay even so much. To part with money is a sacrifice beyond almost all
men endowed with a sense of order. There is scarcely any man alive
who does not think himself meritorious for giving his neighbour five pounds.
Thriftless gives, not from a beneficent pleasure in going, but from a lazy
delight in spending. He would not deny himself one enjoyment ; not his
opera-stall, not his horse, not his dinner, not even the pleasure of giving
Lazarus the five pounds. Tlrifty, who is good, wise, just, and owes no
man a penny, turns from a beggar, haggles with a hackney-coachman, or
denies a poor relation, and I doubt which is the most selfish of the two.
Money has only a different value in the eyes of each.
So, in a word, Pitt Crawled thought he would do something for his
brother, and then thought that he would think about it some other
time.

And with regard to Beck, she was not a woman who expected too
much from the generosity of her neighbours, and so was quite content
with all that. Pitt Crawled had done for her. She was acknowledged by
the head of the family. If litt would not give her anything, he would
get something for her some day. If she got no money from her brother-
in-law, she got what was as good as money,-credit. Ragglcs was made
rather easy in his mind by the spectacle of the union between the brothers,
by a small payment on the spot, and by the promise of a much larger
sum speedily to be assigned to him. And Reheccn told Miss rings,
whose Christmas divided upon the little so lent by her, Beck paid
with an air of candid joy, and as if her exchequer was brimming oven
with gold-Rlebecea, we say, told Miss Brings, in strict confidence, that
she had couferred with Sir Pitt, who was famous as a finncier, on bRings's
special hehalf, as to the most profitable investment of Miss B,'s remain-
ing capital; that Sir Pitt, after much consideration, had thought of a most
safe and advantageous way in which Brings could any out her money;
that, being especially interested in her as in attached friend of the late
Miss Crawled, and of the whole fly, and the long before he left town, he
had recommended that she should be ready with the money but a moment's
notice, so as to purchase at the most favouruable opportunity the shares
which Sir Pitt had in his eye. Poor Miss Brings was very grateful for
this mark of Sir Pitt's attention-it came so unsolicited, she said, for she
never should have thought of removing the money from the ends-and
the delicacy enhanced the kindness of the office; and she promised to see
her man of business immediately, and be ready with her little cssh at the
proper hour.
And this worthy woman was so grateful for the fulness of Rcbeeca in
the matter, and for that of her generous benefactor, the Colonel, that she
went out and spent a great part of her half year's divided in the purchase
of a black velvet coat for little Rawdon, who by the way was grown almost
too bi for black velvet now, and was of a size and age bcfitting him for
the assumption of the virile object and pantaloons.
DIe was a fine open faced boy, with blue eyes and waving flaxen hair, surly

said to have ended. The beautiful mother-vision hal faded away after
a while. During near two years she had scarcely spoken to the child.
She disliked him. He had the easiest and the hoping-cough. He
bored her. One day when he was standing at the landing-place, having
crept down from the upper regions, attracted by the sound of his mother's
voice, who was singing to Lord Street, the drawing-room door opening
suddenly, discovered the little spy, who but a moment before had been
rapt in delight, and listening to the music.

HIs mother came out and struck him violently a couple of boxes on the
ear. DIe heard a laugh from the Marquise in the inner room, (he was
myself by this free and artless exhibition of Beck's temper,) and fled
down below to his friends of the kitchen, bursting in an agony of grief.
 It is not because it hurts me,'' little Rawdon gasped out-``only-
only''-sobs and tears wound up the sentence in a storm. It was the
little boy's heart that was bleeding.  Why my't I hear her singing:

After this incident, the mother's dislike increased to nature; the con-
seriousness that the child was in the house was a reproach and a pain to
her. 1lis very sight annoyed her. Fear, doubt, and resistance sprang
up, too, in the boy's own bosom. They were separated from that day of
the boxes on the ear.
Lord Sense also heartily disliked the boy. When they met by his-
chance, he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child, or glared at him
with savage-looking eyes. Rawdon used to stare him in the face, and
double his little fists in return. He knew his enemy; an this gentle-
man, of all who came to the house, was the one who angered him most.
One day the footman found him squaring his fists at Lord Stone's lat
in the hall. The footman told the circumstance as a good joke to Lord
Stone's coachman; that officer imparted it to Old there's gentleman,
and to the servants' hall in general. And very soon afterwards, when
Mrs. Rawdon Crawled made her appearance at Gaunt House, the porter
who unbarred the gates, the servants of all uniforms in the hall, the
funcetionaries in white wnisteonts, who bawled not from landing to landing

And, I shame to say, she would not have got credit had they not
believe her to be guilty. It was the sight of the Marquis of Stone's
carriage-lamps at her door, contcmplated by Ragglcs, burning in the black-
ness of midnight, `` that kept him up,'' as he afterwards said; that, even
more than llcbeeca's arts and coaxings.
And so-guiltless very likely-she was writhing and pushing onward
towards what they call ``'a position in society,'' and the servants were
pointing at her as lost and ruined. So you see Molly the housemaid of a
morning, watching a spider in the door-post lay his three and laloriously
crawl up it, until, tired of the sport, she raises her room and swceeps away
the thread and the sacrifice.
A day or two before Christmas, they, her husband and her son made
ready and went to pass the holidays at the seat of their ancestors at
Queen's Crawled. Been would have liked to leave the little bent behind,
and would but for Lady Jane's urgent invitations to the youngster; and
the symptoms of revolt and discontent which Rawdon manifested at her
neglect of her son. He's the finest boy in England,'' the father said, in
a tone of reproach to her, `" and you don't seem to care for him, Becks, as
much as you do for your spaniel. I shan't bother you much: at home
he will be away from you in the nursery, and he shall go outside on the
coach with me.''
Where you go yourself because you want to smoke those filthy cigars,''
replies Mrs. Rawdon.
 I remember when you liked 'em though,'' answered the husband.
Beck laughed: she was almost always good-humoured.  hat was
when I was on my promotion, Goosey,'' she said. `` Take Rawdon outside
with you, and give him a cigar too if you like.''
Rawlon did not warm his little son for the winter's journey in this
way, but he and Brings wrapped up the child in shawls and comforters,
and he was hoistel respectfully on to the roof of the couch in the dark
morning, under the lamps of the White Horse Cellar: and with no small
delight he watched the dawn rise, and made his first journey to the place
which his father still called home. It was a journey of infinite pleasure
to the boy, to whom the incidents of the road afore endless interest;
his father answering to him all questions connected with it, and telling
im who lived in the great white house to the right, and whom the park
belonged to. His mother, inside the vehicle with her maid and her furs,
her wrappers, and her scent bottles, made such a to-do that you would
have thought she never had been in a stage once before-much less, that
she had been turned out of this very one to make room for a paying
passenger on a certain journey performed some half-score years ago.
It was dark again when little Rawdon was wakened up to enter is
uncle's carriage at Mudhury, and he sat and looked out of it wondering
as the great iron gates flew open, and at the white trunks of the limes as
they swept by, until they stopped, at length, before the light windows of
the HIll, which were blazing and comfortable with Christmas welcome.

the old Turkey one that used to be in the Ladies' Gallery,'' thought
became, and the next instant was kissing Lady Jane.
She and Sir Pitt performed the same salute with great gravity : but
Rawdon having been smoking, hung back rather from his sister-in-law,
whose two children came up to their cousin; and, while Matilda held out
her hand and kissed him, Pitt Inside Southern, the son and heir,
stood aloof rather, and examined him as a little dog does a big dog.
Then the kind hostess conducted her guests to the snug apartments
gazing with cheerful fires. Then the young ladies came and knocked at
MRs. Rawson's door, under the pretence that they were desirous to be
useful, but in reality to have the pleasure of inspecting the contents of her
bank and bonnet-boxes, and her dresses which, though black, were of the
news I.london fashion. And they told her how much the Hall was changed
for the better, and how old Lady Southdown was gone, and how Pitt was
taking his station in the country, as became a Crawled in fact. Then the
great dinner-bell having rung, the family assembled at dinner, at which
meal london Junior was placed by his aunt, the good-natured lady of the
house; Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his sister-in-law at his
own right hand.
Little Million exhibited a fine appetite, and showed a gentlemanliks
behaviour.
I Like to dine here,'' he said to his aunt when he had completely his
call, at the conclusion of which, and after a decent grace by Sir Pitt, the
young son and air was introduced, and was perched on a high chair by
the baronet's side, while the daughter took possession of the place and
the little wine-glass prepared for her near her mother. `I like to dine
here,'' said Rawdon Minor, looking up at his relation's kind face.
 WAy '' and the good Lady Jane.
:I dine in the kitchen when I am at home,'' replied Rawdon Minor,
`' or else with Brings.'' But Cheek was so engaged with the baronet, her
host, pouring out a flood of compliments and delights and raptures, and
admiring young Pitt like, whom she declared to be the most beautiful,
intelligent, noble looking little creature, and so like his father, that she did
not hear the remarks of her own flesh and blood at the other end of the
broad shining table.
As a guest, and it being the first night of his arrival, Rawdon the Second
was allowed to sit up until the hour when tea being over, and a great gilt
hook being laid on the table before-Sir Pitt, all the destinies of the family
streamed in, and Sir Pitt read prayers. It was the first time the poor
little boy had ever witnessed or heard of such a ceremonial.
The house had been much improved even since the Baronet's brief reign,
and was pronounced by Beck to be perfect, charming, delightful, when
she surveyed it in his company. As for little Rawdon, who examined it
with the children For his guides, it seemed to him a perfect palace of
enchantment and wonder. There were long galleries, and ancient state-
bed rooms, there were pictures and old china, and armour. There were
the rooms in which Grandpapa died, and by which the children walked
with terrified looks. ee Who was Grandpapa ?'' he asked; and they told

away yonder to the church, of which the spire was glittering over the
park elms.
The brothers had good occupation for several mornings in examining the
improvements which had been effected by Sir Pitt's genius and economy.
And as they walked or rode, and looked at them, they could talk without
too much bright each other. And Pitt took care to tell Rawdon what as
heavy outlay of money these improvements had oeeasioned; and that
a man of landed and founded property was often very hard pressed for
twenty pounds. There is that new lodge gate,'' sail Pitt, pointing to it
humbly with the bamboo one, ``I can no more pay for it before the
divided in January than I can fly.''
`I can lend you, Pitt, till then,'' Rawdon answered rather ruefully;
and they went in and looked at the restored lodge, where the family arms
were just new scraped in stone; and where old Mrs. Look, for the first
time these many long years, had tight doors, soul roofs, and whole

go. The bDowager wrote off' the direst descriptions of her daughter's
worldly behaviour to the authoress of the ` Washerwoman of Finally
Common'' at the Cape; and her house in frighten being but this time
unoceupicd, returned to that watering-place, her absence being not very
much deplorcd by her children. We may suppose, too, that kebccea, on
paying a second visit to queen's Crawled, did not feel particularly grieved
at the absence of the lady of the edicine-chest; though she wrote a
Christmas letter to her ladyship, in which she respectfully recalled herself
to Lady South's recollection, spoke with gratitude of the delight
which her ladyship's conversation had given her on the former visit,
dilated on the kindness with which her ladyship had treated her in sick-
ness, and declared that everything at queen's Curled reminded her of
lcr absent friend.
A great part of the altered demeanour and popularity of Sir Pitt
Crawled ight hue been truce to the counsels of that matter little lady
of Curzon 5street. `` Io remain n baronet-you consent to be a mere
country gentleman,'' she said to him, while he had been her guest in
London. t No, Sir it Crawled, I know you better. I know your
talents and your ambition. you fancy you hide them both: but you can
conceal neither from me. I showed Lord Sense your pamphlets on malt.
DIe was familiar with it: and said it was in the opinion of the whole Cubinet
the most masterly thing that had appeared on the subject. The Ministry
has its eye upon you, and I know what you want. you want to listen-
guish yourself in parliament; every one says you are the finest speaker in
England (for your speeches at Oxford are still remembered.) You want to
be Member for the County, where with your own vote and your borough
at your back, you c command anything. And you want to be BRoken
Crawled of queen's Crawled, and will be before you lie. I saw it all. I
could rend your heart, Sir 1it. If I had a husband who possessed your
intellect as he does your name, I sometimes think I should not be unworthy
of him-but-but I am your kinsman now,'' she added with a laugh.
Poor little penniless I have got a little interest-and who knows, perhaps
the mouse may be able to and the lion,''
Pitt Crawled was amazed and enraptured with her speech. ``DOwn the
woman comprcheuls me'' he said. ``I never could get Anne to read these
pages of the malt-pampllet. She has no idea that I have commanding
talents or secret ambition. So they remember my speaking at Oxford, do

Therefore it was that this anguish iplomatist had grown so hcspitable;
that he was so civil to oratorios and hospitals; so kind to Deans and
Chapters; so generous in giving and accepting dinners; so uncomnonly
gracious to farmers on market-days; and so much interested about county

On Christmas day a great family gathering took place. All the Raw-

Mrs. But, as if the other had never been her enemy, nffectionately
interested in the der girls, and surprised at the progress which they had

lusts out of the great song-books which Jim, grumbling, had been forced
to bring under his arm from the story. Mrs. But, perforce, was
obliged to adopt a decent demeanour towards the little adventuress-of
course being free to discourse with er daughters afterwards about the
absurd respect with which Sir Pitt treated his sister-in-law. But Him, who
had sat next to her at dinner, declared she was a trump: and one and all
of the Rector's family agreed that the little Rawlon was a fine boy. They
respected a possible baronet in the boy, between whom and the title there
was only the little sickly pale Pitt Inside.
The children were very good friends. Pitt Inside was too little a dog
for such a big dog as Rawlon to play with : and MIatilda being only a
girl, of course not fit companion for a young gentleman who was near eight
years old, and going into jackets very soon. He took the command of
this small party at once-the little girl and the little boy following him
but with great reverence at such times as he condescended to sport
with them. His happiness and pleasure in the country were extreme.
he kitchen-garden pleased him surely, the flowers moderately, but the
pigeons and the poultry, and the stables when he was allowed to visit them,
were delightful objects to him. He resisted being kissed by the Miss
Scrawled: but he allowed Lady Jane sometimes to embrace in: and
it was by her side that he like to sit when the signal to retire to the
drawing-room being given, the ladies left the gentlemen to their claret-
by her side rather than by his mother. For Rebecca seeing that tenderness
was the fashion, called Rawdon to her one evening, and stooped down and
kissed him in the presence of all the ladies.
He looked her full in the face after the operation, trembling and
turning very red, as his wont was when moved. :You never kiss me
at home, Mamma,'' he said; at which there was a general silence and
consternation, and a by no means pleasant look in Beck's eyes.
Rawdon was fond of his sister-in-law, for her regard for his son. Lady
Jane and Beck did not get on it so well at this visit as on occasion of
the former one, when the Colonel's wife was bet upon pleasing. Those

two speeches of the child struck rather a chill. Perhaps Sir Pitt was
rather too attentive to her.
But don, as became his age and size, was fonder of the society of
the men than of the women; and never wearied of accompanying his side
to the stables, whither the Colonel retired to smoke his cigar-is, the
Rector's son, sometimes joining lis cousin in that and other amusements.
HIe mud the Baronet's keeper were very close friends, their mutual taste
for ``dawgs '' bringing them much together. On one way, Mr. James,
this Colonel, and along, the keeper, went and shot pheasants, taking little
Rawdon with them. On another most blissful morning, these four
gentlemen cartoon of the amusement of rat-hunting in a barn, as which
sport Down as yet had never seen acting so noble. They stopped
p the ends of certain drains in the barn, into the other openings of which
ferrets were inserted; and then stood silently aloof with uplifted stakes in
their hands, and an anxious little terrier (Mr. James's celebrated `' dawn''
Forceps, indeed,) scarcely breathing from excitement, listening motionless
on three legs, to the faint squeaking of the rats below. Desperately
hold at last, the persecutcd animals bolted above-ground: the terror
accounted for one, the keeper for another, Rawdon, from flurry and
excitement missed his rat, but on the other hand he half-murdered n
ferret.
But the greatest day of all was that on which i Huldlestone Fuddle-
stone's hounds met upon the lawn at queen's Crawled,
That was a famous sight for little woman. At half-past ten, Tom
Moody, Sir Huddlestoue Fudllestone's huntsman, is seen trotting un the
avenue, followed by the noble pack of hounds in a compact body-the
rear being brought up by the two whips clad in stained scarlet frocks-
light hard-featured lays on well-bred lean horses, possessing marvellous
dexterity in casting the points of their long heavy whips at the thinnest
part of any dog's skin who dares to struggle from the main body, or to
take the slightest notice, or even so much as wink at the hares and
rabbits starting under their nose.
Next comes boy Jack, Tom Moody's son, who weighs five stone, me-
sure night-and-forty inches, and will never be any bigger. It is perched
on a large raw-boned hunter, half-covered by a capacious saddle. This
animal is Sir luddlestone Fuddlestone's favourite horse-the Nob. Other
horses, ridlen by other small boys, arrive from time to time, awaiting their
masters, who will come cantering on anon.
Town Moody rides up to the door of the Hall, where he is welcome by
the butler, who offers him drink, which he declines. He and his one
then draw off into a sheltered corner of the lawn, where the dogs roll on
the grass, and play or gronl angrily at one another, ever and anon
breaking out into furious fight speedily to be quelled by Tom's voice,
unmatched at rating, or the snaky things of the whips.
Many young gentlemen canter up on thorough-bred hacks, shutter-
dashed to the knee, and enter the house to drink cherry-brandy and pay
their respects to the ladies, or more modest and sportsman-like, divest
themselves of their mud-boots, exchange their hacks for their hunter, and
warm their blood by a preliminary gullop round the lawn. Then they

collect round the back in the corner, and talk with Tom MOody of past
sport and the merits of Sniveller and DIamond, and of the state of the
country and of the wretched breed of foxes.
Sir IIuddlestone presently appears mounted on a clever cob, and rides
up to the Hall, where he enters and does the civil thing by the ladies,
after which, being a man of few words, he proceeds to business. The
hounds are drawn up to the HAll-door and little Rawdon descends amongst
them, excited yet half alarmed by the caresses which they bestow upon
him, at the thump he receives from their waving tails, and at their canine
flickering, scarcely restrained by Tom Moody's tongue and lash.
Meanwhile, Sir Hulllestone his hoisted himself unwieldily on the Nob:
Let's try Sister's Bpinney, Tom,'' says the Baronet, '' Farmer Mangle
tells me there are two foxes in it.'' Tom blows his horn and trots off,
followed by the back, by the whips, by the young gets from Winchester,
by the farmers of the neighbourhood, by the labourers of the parish on
foot, with whom the day is a great holiday; Sir Hudllestone bringing up
the rear with Colonel Crawled, and the whole cortge disappears down
the avenue.
The eternal But Crawled (who has been too modest to appear at
the public meet before his nephew's windows), and whom on Moody
remember forty years back n slender divine riding the wildest horses,
jumping the widest brooks, and larking over the newest gates in the
country,-his reverence, we say, happens to trot out from the rectory
Lanc of his powerful black horse, just as Sir Huddlestone passes; he
joins te worthy barouet. Ilounls and horsemen disappear, and little
Rawdon remains on the door-steps, wondering and happy.
During the progress of this memorable holiday, little Woman, if he had
got no special liking for his uncle, always awful and cold, and locked up
in his study plunged in justice-business and surrounded by bailiffs and
farmers-has gained the good graces of his married and maiden aunt, of
the two little folks of the lIall, and of Him of the rectory, whom Sir Pitt is
encouraging to pay his addresses to one of the young ladies, with an
understanding doubtless that he shall be presented to the living when it
shall be created by lis fox-hunting old sire. Jim las given up that sport

worldly torrents, and is preparing himself for a change in his condition.

family.
Also before this merry Christmas was over, the Baronet had screwed up
courage enough to give his brother another draft on his bankers and for
no less a sum than a hundred pounds, an act which caused Sir Pitt
cruel lungs at first, but which made him glow afterwards to think himself
one of the most generous of men. london and his son went away with
the utmost heaviness of heart. Eyes and the ladies parted with some
alacrity, however: and our friend returned to London to commence those

nvocations with which we find her occupied when this chapter begins.
Under her care the Crawled House in Great Gaunt Street was quite
rejuvenescent, and ready for the reception of Sir Pitt and his family,
when the Baronet came to london to attend lis duties in Parliament,
and to assume that position in the country for which his vast genius
fitted him.
For the first session, this profound dissembler hid his projects and never
opened his lips but to present a petition from Mudbury. But he attended
nssiduously in his place, and learned thoroughly the routine and business
of the house. At home he gave himself up to the perusal of Blue
Books, to the alarm and wonder of Lady Jane, who thought he was killing
himself by late hours and intense application. And he made acquaintance
with the ministers, and the chiefs of his party, determining to rank as
one of them before many years were her.
Lady Jane's sweetness and kindness had inspired Rebecca with such a
contempt for her ladyship as the little woman sound o small difficulty in
coneceuling. That sort of goodness and simplicity which Lady Jane possessed
annoyed our friend Beck, and it was impossible for her at times not to
show, or to let the other divine er scorn. Her presence, too, rendered
Lady Jane uneasy. Iler husband talked constantly with Beck. Signs
of intelligence seemed to pass between them: and Pitt spoke with her o
subjects on which he never thought of discoursing with Icy Jane. The
latter did not understand them to be sure, but it was mortifying to remain
silent; still more mortilying to know that you had nothing to say, and
her that little audncious Mrs. Rawdon darling on from subject to sob-
jack, with a word for every man, and a joke always pat; and to sit in
one's own lousealoue, by the fireside, and watching all the men round
your rival.
In the country, when nay Jane was telling stories to the children, who
clustered about her knees, (little Rawdon into the bargain, who was very
fond of her)-and Lucky came into the room, sneering, with green scornful
eyes, poor LAdy An green silent under those balcful glance. Her
simple little fancies shrank away tremuloualy, as fairies in the story-looks,
before n superior bad angel. She could not go on, although Rebecca,
with the smallest inflection of gardens in her voice, besought her to con-
tinge that charming story. And on her side, gentle thoughts and simple
pleasures were odious to Mrs. Beck, they discorded with her; she
hated people for liking them; she spurued children and children-lovers.
 I have no taste for bread and butter,'' she would say, when caricnturing
Lady Jane and her ways to my Lord Sense.
No more has n certain person for holy water,'' his lordship replied with
a bow and a grin, and a great jarring laugh afterwards.
So these two ladies did not see much of each other except upon those
occasions, when the younger brother's wife, having an object to gain from
the other, frequentel her. They my-loved and my-dcured each other
assiduously, but keep apart generally: whereas Sir Pitt, in the midst of
his multiplicd avocations, found daily time to see his sister-in-law.
On the occasion of his first Speaker's dinner, Sir Pitt took the door-
unity of appearing before his sister-in-law in his uniform-that old

diplomatio suit which he had worn when attached to the Pumpernickel
legation.
Beck complimented him upon that dress, and admired him almost as
much as his own wife and children, to whom he displayed himself before
he set out. She said that it was only the thorough-bred gentleman that
could wear the Court suit with advantage: it was only your men of ancient
race whom the cottage course became. Pitt looked down with company-
scene at his legs, which had not, in truth, much more symmetry or swell

been most gracious to the new barouet and member. Pitt was struck too
by the deference with which the great Peer treated his sister-in-law, by
her ease and sprightliness in the conversation, and by the delight with
which the other men of the party listened to her talk. Lord Sense made
no doubt but that the baronet and only commenced his career in public
life, and expected rather anxiously to hear him as an orator; as they were
neighbours (for Great Gaunt Street leads into Gaunt Square, whereof Gaunt
House, as everybody knows, forms one side) my lord hoped that as soon
as Lady Sense arrived in London she would have the honour of making
the acquaintance of Lady Crawled. He left a card upon his neighbour in

were meanwhile passing their
a-


Christmas after their fashion,
and in a manner by no means
too cheerful.
Out of the hundred pounds
a year, which was about the
taunt of her income, the
widow Borne had been in
the habit of giving up nearly
three-fourths to her father
and mother, for the expenses
of herself and her little boy.
With A120 more, supplied
by Joy., this family of four
people, attended by a single
Irish servant who also did for
Clasp and his wife, might
manage to live in decent come-
fort through the year, and hold up their heads yet, an be able to give
friend a dish of ten still, after the storms and lisappointments of their
curly life. Sedley still maintained lis ascendancy over the family of
It. Clasp, his ex-clerk. Clasp remembered the time when, sitting on
1the edge of the chair, he tossed off a summer to the health of ` Mrs.S---,
lips May, and Mr. Joseph in Inlia,' at the merchant's rich table in
lussell Square. Time magnified the splendour of those recollections in the
honest clerk's bosom. Every time he ce up from the kitchen-parlour
to the drawing-room, and cartoon of tea or gin-and-water with Mr. Sedley,
he would say, '` This was not what you was accustomed to once, Sir,'' and
as gravely and reverentially drink the health of the ladies as he had
done in the days of their utmost prosperity. He thought Miss 'lelia's
playing the divinest music ever performed, and her the finest lady. He
ever would sit down before Sedley at the club even, nor would he have
that gentleman's character abused by any member of the society. He
had seen the first men in London shaking hands with Mr. S-; he
said, `` I'd known him in times when Rothschild might be seen on Change
with him any day, and he owed him personally everything.''
Clasp, with the best of characters and hand-writings, had been able cry
soon after his master's disaster to find other employment for himself.
A NOVEL wITH A FIERY.
4I1
 Such a little fish as me can swim in any bueket,'' he used to remark,
and a member of the house from which old Sedley had seeeded was very
glad to make use of Mr, Clasp's services, and to reward them with a come-
fortable salary. In fine, all Sedley's wealthy friends had dropped off
one by one, and this poor ex-dependent still remained faithfully attached
to him.
Out of the small residue of her income, which Amelin kept back for
herself, the widow had need of all the thrift and care possible in order to
enable her to keep her darling boy dressed in such a mare as became
George Borne's son, and to defray the expenses of the little school to
which, after much misgiving and reluctance, and many secret pigs and
fears on her own part, she had been induced to scud the end. Sue and
sat up of nights cunning lessons and spcelling over crabbed gammars and
geography books in order to teach them to George. She had worked
even at the Satin accident, fondly hoping that she might be capable of
instrncting him in that language. To part with him all day: to send
him out to the mercy of n schoolmnster's cane and his schoolfellows'
roughness, was almost like weaning him over again, to that weak mother,
so tremulous and full of sensibility. IHIc, for his part, rushed off to the
school with the utmost happiness. He was longing for the change. That
childish gladness wounded his mother, who was herself so grieved to part
with him. She would rather have hnl hi more sorry, she thought : and
then was deeply repentant within herself, for during to be so selfish as to
wish her own son to be unhappy.
George made great progress in the school, which was kept by a friend of
his mother's constant admirer, the Res. Mr, Dinner. DIe brought me
numberless prizes and testimouials of ability. DIe told his mother count-
less stories eery night about his school-companions: and what a fine
fellow Lyons was, and what n seen Sniffin was: and how Steel's father
actually supplied the meat for the establishment, whereas Holding's mother
came in a carriage to fetch him every Saturday : and how Nent had straps
to his trowsers,-might he have straps and how Bull Major was so strong
(though only in Lustrous) that it was hclievet le could lick the Usher,
Mr, Ward himself. So Mmelia cared to know every one of the boys in
that school as well as George himself: and of nights she used to help him
in his exercises and puzzle her little head over his lessons as eagerly us if
she was herself going in the morning into the presence of the master.
Once, after a certain combat with Master Smith, George come home to his
mother with a black eye, and brngged proligiously to his parent and his
delighted old grandfather about his valour in the light, in which, if the
truth was known, he did not behave with particular heroism, and in which
he decidedly had the worst. But Amelia has never forgiven that Smith
to this lay, though he is now a peaceful apothecary near Lcicester
Square.
In these quiet labours and harmless cares the gentle widow's life was
passing away, a silver hair or two marking the progress of time on her
head, and a line deepening ever so little on her fair forehead.. Lie used
to smile at these marks of time. e hat matters it,'' she asked, `for

great, famous, and glorious, as he desired to be. She kept his copy-
books, his drawings, and compositions, and showed them about in In
little circle, as if they were circles of genius. She confided some of
these specimens to Miss Doing : to slow them to Miss Borne, George's
aunt, to show them to Mr. Scorned himself-to make that old ran
repent of his cruelty and ill-feeling towards him who was gone. All her
husband's faults and foibles she had buried in the grave with him: she
only remembered the lover, who had married her at all sacrifices : the
noble husband so brave and beautiful, in whose arms she had hung on
the morning when he had gone away to fight, and die gloriously for his
king. From heaven the hero must be smiling down upon that paragon
of a boy whom he had left to comfort and console her.
We have seen how one of George's grandfathers (Mr. Borne), in
his easy chair in Trusses Square, daily grew more violent and moody,
and how his daughter, with her fine carriage, and her fine horses, and
her name on half the public charity-lists of the town, was a lovely,
miserable, persecuted old maid. She thought again and again of the
beautiful little boy, her brother's son, whom she had seen. She longed
to be allowed to drive in the fine carriage to the house in which he lived:
and she used to look out day after day as she took her solitary drive in
the Park, in hopes that she might see him. Her sister, the banker's lady,
occasionally condescended to pay her old home and companion a visit in
llussell Square. She brought a couple of sickly children attended by a
prim nurse, and in a faint genteel giggling tone cackled to her sister
about her fire acquaintance, and how her little Frederick was the image of
Lord Cloud Lollipops, and her sweet Maria had been noticed by the
Baroness as they were driving in their donkey-chaise at Roehampton.
She urged her to make her papa do something for the dnrlings. Fre-
dick she had determined should go into the Guards ; and if they made
an elder son of him (ud Mr. Bullock was positively ruining and pinehing
himself to death buy land), how was the falling girl to be provided for

which kind of speeches, in which fashion and the main chance were
blended together, and after a kiss, which was like the contact of an
oyster-Mrs. Frelerick Bullock would gather her starched nestlings, and
simpler back into her carriage.
Every visit which this leader of for paid to her family was more unlucky
for her. Her father paid more money into Stumpy and Rowly's. Her
patronage became more and more insufferable. The poor widow in the
little cottage at Brompton, guarding her treasure there, little knew how
eagerly some people coveted it.
A N0VE WITHOUT A PIER0O.
 413
On that night when Jane Scorned had told her father that she had
seen his grandson, the old man had made her no reply: but he had
shown no anger-and and bade her good night on going himself to his
room in rather a kindly voice. And he must have meditated on what she
said, and have made some inquiries of the Domain family regarding her
visit; for a fortnight after it took place, he asked her where was her little
French watch and chin she used to wear?
I bought it with my money, Sir,'' she said in a great fright.
Go and order another like it, or a better if you can get it,'' said the
old gentleman, and lapsed again into silence.
Of late, the Miss Dobins more than once repeated their entrenalies to
Amelia, to allow george to visit them. His aunt had shown her inclina-
lion; perhaps his grandfather himself, they hinted, might be disposed to
be reconciled to him. Surely, Amelia could not refuse such nadvantageous
chances for the boy. Nor could she : but she needed to their overtures
with a very heavy and suspicious heart, was always uneasy during the
child's absence from her, and welcomed him back as if he was rescued out
of some danger. He brought back money and toys, nt which the widow
looked with alarm and jealousy: she asked him always if he had seen any
gentleman-`` Only old Sir William, who drove him about in the four-
wheeled chaise, and Mr. Doing, who arrived on the beautiful bay horse in
the afternoon-in the green coat and pink neck-cloth, with the gold-headed
whip, who promised to show him the Tower of London, and take him out
with the Surrey hounds.'' At last, he said  There was an old gentleman,
with thick eye-brows and a broad hat, and large chain and seals. He came
one day as the coachman was longing George round the lawn on the grey
pony. He looked at every much. He shook very much. I said' My
name is Norval' after dinner. My aunt began to cry. She is always
crying.'' Such was George's report on that night.
Then Amelia knew that the boy had seen his grandfather: and looked
on feverishly for a proposal which she was sure would follow, and which
came, in fact, in a few days afterwards. Mr. Shone formally offered to
take the boy, and make him her to the fortune which he had intended that
his father should inherit. le would make Mrs. George Borne an
allowance, such as to assure her a decent completely. If Mrs., George
Borne proposed to marry again, as Mr. O, heard was her intention, he
would not withdraw that allowance. But it must be understood, that
the child would live entirely with his grandfather in smell Square, or at
whatever other place Mr. O. should select; and that he would be occasion-
ally permitted to see Mrs. George Borne at her own residence. This
message was brought or read to her in a letter one day, when her mother
was from home, and her father absent as usual, in the City,
She was never seen angry but twice or thrice in her life, and it was in
one of these moods that Mr, Borne's attorney had the fortune to
behold her. She rose up trembling and flushing very much as soon as, after
reading the letter, Mr. Poet handed it to her, and she tore the paper into
a hundred fragments, which she trod on. ``I marry again l-I take money
to part from my child1 Who dares insult me by proposig such a thing:
Tell Mr. Borne it is a cowardly letter, Sir-a cowardly letter-I will not

answer it. I wish you good morning, Sir-and she bowed me out of the
room like a tragedy Green,'' said the lawyer who told the story.
Her parents never remarked her agitation on that day, and she never
told them of the interview. They had their own affairs to interest them,
affairs which deeply interested this innocent and unconscious lady. The
old gentleman, her father, was always dabbling in speoulation. We have
seen how the Wine Company and the Coal Company had failed him. But,
prowling about the City always eagerly and restlessly still, he lighted upon
some other scheme, of which he thought so well that he embarked in it in
spite of the remonstrances of Mr, Clasp, to whom indeed he never dared
to tell how far he had engaged himself in it. And as it was always
Mr. Sedley's maxim not to talk about money matters before women, they
had no tinkling of the misfortunes that were in store for them until the
unhappy old gentleman was forced to make gradual confessions.
The bells of the little household, which had been settle weekly, first fell
into arrear. The remittances had not arrived from Inlia, Mr. Sedley told
his wife with a disturbed face. As she had paid her bills very regularly
hitherto, one or two of the tradesmen to whom the poor lady was obliged
to go round asking for time were very angry at a delay, to which they
were perfectly used from more irregular customers. Emmy's contribution,
paid over cheerfully without any questions, kept the little company in half
rations however. And the first six months passed away pretty easily : old
Sedley still keeping up with the notion that his ashares must rise, and
that ull would be well.
No sixty pounds, however, came to help the household at the end of
the half year; and it fell deeper and deeper into trouble-Mrs. Sedley,
who was growing infirm and was much shaken, remained silent or wept a
great deal with Mrs. Clasp in the kitchen. The butcher was particularly
surly: the grower insolent-once or twice little George had grumblel
about the dinners: and Amelia, who still would have been satisfied with a
slice of bread for her own dinner, could not but perceive that her son was
neglected, and purchased little things out of her private purse to keep the
hoy in health.
At last they told her, or told her such a gnarled story as people in dit6-
clothes tell. One day, her own money having been received, and Amelian
about to pay it over: she who had kept an account of the money exrpended
by her, proposed to keep a certain portion back out of her divided,
having contracted engagements for a new suit for George.
hen it came out that Joy's remittances were not paid; that the house
was in difficulties which Amelia ought to have seen before, her mother said,
but she cared for nothing or nobody except George. At this she passed all
of her money across the table without a word to her mother, and returned
to her room to cry her eyes out. She had a great access of sensibility too
that day, when obliged to go and countermanl the clothes, the darling
clothes on which she had sect her heart for Christmas day, and the cut and
fashion of which she had arranged in many conversations with a small
milliner, her friend.
Hardest of all, she had to break the matter to George, who made a long

him. the poor widow lad only kisses to give him. She darnel the old
suit in tears. She cast about among her little ornaments to see could she
sell any thing to procure the desired noveltiesP here was her India
shawl that bobbin had sent her. She remembered in former days going
with her mother to a fine India shop on Luggage Will, where the ladies
had all sorts of denlings and bargains in these articles. 1Her checks
flushed and her eyes shone with pleasure as she thought of this resource,
and he kissed away george to school in the morning, smiling brightly
after him. The boy felt there was good news in her look.
Picking up her shawl in a handkerchief, (another of the gifts of the good
MIajor,) she hid them under her cloak, and walked flushed and eager all
the way to Luggage WIll, tripping along by the Park wall, and running
over the crossing, so that many a man turned as she hurried by him, and
looked after her rosy pretty face. She caleultcd how she should spend
the proceeds of her shawl: how, besides the clothes, she would buy the
books that he longed for, and pay his hall-year's schooling;: and how slc
would buy a clock for her father instead of that old great-coat which he
wore. She was not mistaken as to the value of the Mnjor's gift. It was
a very fine and beautiful web: and the merchant made a Very good bar-
gain when he gave her twenty guineas for her shawl.
She in on amazed and flurried with her riches to Darton's shop in St.
Paul's Church yard, and there purchased the ` parent's Assistant,'' and.
the ``Snmndforl and Merton'' George longed for, and got into the coach
there with her parcel, and went home exsulting. And she pleased herself
by writing in the fly-leaf in her nearest little hand, ``George Borne, Y
Christmas gift from his affectionate mother.'' The books are extant to this
day, with the fair delicate superscription.
She was going from her own room with the books in her hnl to
place them on George's table, where he might find them on his return
from school,; when in the passage, she and her mother met. The gilt
bindings of the seven handsome little volumes caught the old lady's eye.
 WHat are those P'' she said.
 Some books for George,'' Amelia replies, blushing-'` I-I promised
them to him at Christmas.''

inmates heard every word of the colloquy.

morning. TAke the money-take everything ''-and with quivering hands
she took out her silver, and her sovereigns-her precious golden sovereigns,
which she thrust into the lids of her mother, whence they overflowed and
tumbled, rolling down the stairs.
And then she went into her room, and sank down in despair and utter
misery. She saw it all now. Her selfishness was sacrificing the boy. But
for her he might have wealth, station, education, and his father's place,
which the elder George had forfeited for her sake. She had but to
speak the words, and her father was restored to competency : and the boy
raised to fortune. O what a conviction it was to that tender and stricken
heart

street leads, whither we first conducted Rebcecu,
in the time of the departed Sir Pitt Crawled.
Peering over the railings and through the black
trees into the garden of the Square, you see a few
miserable governesses with wan-faced pupils wan-
during round and round it, and round the dreary
grass-plot in the centre of which rises the seal
of Lord Gaunt, who fought at Minded, in a three-
toiled wig, and otherwise habited like a Roman
lEmeror. Gaunt Ilouse occupics merely a side of
the pure. he remaining three sides are come-
posed of mansions that have passed away into
Dowageris;-tall, dark houses, with window-
frames of stone, or picked out of a lighter red.
Little light seems to be behind those lean, you-
fortless casements now: and hospitality to have
passed away from those doors as much as the
laced lacqueys and link-boys of old times, who used
to put out their torches in the blank iron extinguislers that still flank the
lamps over the steps. Brass plates have penetrated into the Square-
Doctors, the bDidllesex bank WEstern Branch-the English and European
Reunion, &e.-it has a dreary look-nor is my Lord Stone's palace less
dreary. All I have ever seen of it is the vast wall in front, with the rustic
columns at the great gate, through which an old portcr peers sometimes with
a fat and gloomy red face-and over the wall the garret and bed-room
windows, and the chimneys, out of which there seldom comes any smoke
now. For the present LOrd Sense lives at Naples, preferring the view of
the Day and Cried nnl Vesuius, to the dreary aspect of the wall in
Gaunt-square.
A few score of yards down New Gaunt-street, and leading into Gaunt-
mews indeed, is a little modest back door, which you would not remark
from that of any of the other stables. But many a little close carriage
has stopped at that door, as my informnnt (little Tom Eaves, who knows
everything, and who showed me the place) told me.  The Prince and

the famous petits apartements of Lord Stone-one, Sir, fitted up all in
ivory and white satin, another in ebony and black velvet; there is a little
banqucting-room taken from Smallest's house at Pompeii, and painted by
Sway-a little private kitchen, in which every saucepan was silver, and
all the spits were gold. It was there that Egnlite Orleans rested par-
ridges on the night when he and the Marquis of Stone won a hundred
thousand from a great personage at Sombre. Half of the money went to
the French Revolution, half to purchaseLord Gaunt's Marquisate and Carter
-and the remainder-'' but it forms no part of our scheme to tell what
became of the remainder, for every shilling of which, and a great deal more,
little Tom Eaves, who knows everybody's affairs, is ready to account.
Besides his town palaces, the Marquis had castles and palaces in various
quarters of the three kingdom, whereof the descriptions may be found in
the old-books-Castle Strongbow, with its woods, on the Cannon
shore; Gaunt Castle, in Crmrthenshire, where Richard II. was taken
prisoner-Gently Hall in Yorkshire, where I had been informed there
were two hundred silver teapot for the breakfast of the guests of the
house, with everything to correspond in splendour; and Stillbrook in
IIampshire, which was my lord's farm, a humble place of residence, of
which we all remember the wonderful furniture which was sold at my lord's
demise by a late celebrated auctioneer,
The Marchioness of Stone was of the renowned and ancient family
of the Caerlyons, Marquises of Camelot, who hae preserved the old faith
ever since the conversion of the venerable Did, their first anceestor, and
whose pedigree goes far beyond the date of the arrival of King Brute in
these islands, Pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house. The
sons have been called Arthur, Others, and Comrades, from immemorial
time. Their heads have fallen in many a loyal conspiraoy. Elizabeth
chopped of the head of the Arthur of her day, who had been Chamberlain
to philip and Mary, and carried letters between the Queen of Scots and
her uncles the Guises. A scene of the house was an officer of the great
Duke, and distinguished in the famous Saint Bartholomew conspiraey.
During the whole of Mary's confinement, the house of Camelot considered
in her behalf. It was as much injured by its charges in ftting out an
argument against the Spaniards, during the time of the Armada, as by the
lines and confiscations lived on it by Elizabeth for harbouring of priests,
obstinate recusaney, and Polish misdoings. A recent of James's time
was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of that
great theologians, and the fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his
timely weakness. But the Earl of Camelot, of the reign of Charles,
returned to the old creed of his family, and they continued to fight for it,
and ruin themselves for it, as long as there was a Start left to head or to
instigate a rebellion.
Lady Mary Caerlyon was brought up at a Prison convent, the Dan-
witness Marie Antoinette was her godmother. In the pride of her beauty
she had been married-sold, it was said-to Lord Gaunt, then at Paris,
who won must sums from the lady's brother at some of Philip of Orlenns's
banquets. The Earl of Gaunt's famous duel with the Count de is March,

of the Grey Musqueteers, was attributed by common report to the pretty-
signs of that soldier (who had been a page, and remained a favourite of
the been) to the hand of the beautiful Lady Mary Cuerlyon. She was
married to Lord Gaunt while the Count lay ill of his would, and came to
dwell at Gaunt House, and to figure for a short time in the splendid Court
of the Prince of Wales. Fox hnl toasted her. Morris and Sheridan had
written songs about her. MIalmsbry had made her his best bow; Was-
pole had pronounced her charming; Devonslire had been almost jealous
of her; but she was scared by the wild pleasures and gaieties of the society
into which she was flung, and after she had borne a couple of sons, shrank
away into a life of devout seclusion. No wonder that my Lord Stayed,
who liked pleasure and cheerfulness, was not often seen after their marriage,
by the side of his trembling, silent, superstitious, unhappy lady.
The before-mentioned Tom Eaves, (who has no part in this history,
except that he knew all the great folks in London, and the stories and
mysteries of each family,) had further information regarding my lady
Silence, which may or may not be true.  The humiliation,'' TOm used to
say, `which that woman has been made to undergo, in her own house,
have been frightful; Lord Sense has made her sit down to table with
women with whom I would rather die than allow Mrs. Eaves to associate-
with Lady Crackenbury, with Mrs. Chippenhm, with Madame de la
Cruchecasse, the French secretary's wife,'' (from every one of which ladies
Tom RIvers-who would have sacrificed his wife for knowing them-was
too glad to get a bow or a dinner), ``with the reigniug favourite, in a word.
And do you suppose that hat woman, of that family, who are as proud as
the Bourbons, and to whom the Senses are but lackeys, mushrooms of
yesterday (for after all, they are out of the old Haunts, but of a minor and
doubtful branch of the house); do you suppose, l say,'' (the render must bear
in mind that it is always Tom Eaves who speaks), ``that the Marchioness of
stone, the haughtiest woman in England, would bend down to her husband
so submissively, if there were not some cause Pool I tell you there are
secret reasons. I tell you, that in the emigration, the Able de la EMpire
who was here and was employed in the uiberoon business with Puieaya
and Tinteniac, was the same Colonel of Mousquetaires Grim with whom
Sense fought in the year '86-that he and the Marchioness met again:
that it was after the Reverend Colonel was shot in Britain, that Lady
Sense took to those extreme practices of devotion which she carries on
now : for she is closed with her director every day-she is at service at
Spanish-place, every morning, I'he watched her there-that is, i've
happened to be passing there-and depend on it there's a mystery in her
case. People are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent
of,'' added Tom Eaves with a knowing wag of his head; ``and depend
on it, that woman would not be so submissive as she is, if the Marquis
had not some sword to hold over her,''
8o, if Mr. Eyes's information be correct, it is very likely that this lady
in her high station, had to submit to many a private indignity, and to hide
many secret griefs under a calm face. And let us, my brethren, who have
not our names in the Red Book, console ourselves by thinking comfortably

how miserable our betters may be, and that Damocles, who sits on satin
cushions, and is served on old plate, has an awful sword hanging over his
head in the shape of a bailiff, or an hereditary disease, or a family secret,
which peeps out every now and then from the embroidered arrass in a
ghastly manner, and will be sure to drop one day or the other in the
right place.
In comparing, too, the poor man's situation with that of the great, there
is (always according to Mr. Eaves) another great source of comfort for
the former. o who have little or no matrimony to beneath or to
inherit, may be on good terms with your father or your son, whereas the
heir of a great price, such as my Lord Steel, must naturally be angry
at being kept out of his kingdom, and eye the occupant of it with no very
agreeable glances. 'Take it as a rule,'' this sardonic old LEaves would
say, `" the fathers and elder sons of all great families hate each other. The
Crown Prince is always in opposition to the crown or hankering after it.
Shukspeare knew the world, my good Sir, and when he deserilies Prince
HIll (from whose family the Haunts pretend to be descended, though they
are no ore related to John of Gaunt than you are,) trying on his father's
content, he gives you a natural description of all heirs-apparent. If you
were her to a dukcdom and a thousand pounds a day, do you mean to
say you would not wish for possession? Pool And it stands to reason
that every great man, having experienced this feeling towards his father,
must be aware that his sou entertains it towards himself; and so they
can't but be suspicious and hostile.
 Then again, as to the feeling of elder towards younger sous. MY
lend Sir, you ought to know that every elder brother looks upon the depths
of the house as his natural enemies who deprive him of so much ready
money which ought to be his by right. I have often heard George
Me Turk, Lord lajazet's eldest son, say that if he had his will, when he
came to the title, he would do what the sultans do, and clear the estate
by chopping off all his younger brothers' heads at once ; and so the case
is, more or less, with them all. I tell you they are all urks in their
hearts. Pool Sir, they know the world.'' And here, happy, a great
nan coming up, Tom Eaves's hat would drop off his head, and he would
rush forward with a bow and a grin, which showed that he knew the
world too-in the Tomeuvesiun way, that is. And having laid out every
shilling of his fortune on an annuity, Tom could afford to bear no malice
to his nephew and niches, and to have no other feeling with regard to his
betters, but a constant and generous desire to one with them.
Between the Marchioness and the natural and tender regard of mother
for children, there was that cruel barrier placed of difference of faith. Tha
very love which she might feel for her sons, only served to render the
timid and pious lady more fearful and unhappy. The gulph which sea-
rated them was fatal and impassable, She could not stretch her weak
arms across it, or draw her children over to that side away from which
her belief told her there was no safety. During the youth of his sons,

alternately; he promised Mole a bishoprio if he would come over ; and
vowed he would use all his influence to get Trail a cardinal's hat if he
would secede. Neither divine allowed himself to be conquered; and
though the fool mother hoped that her youngest and favourite son would
be reconciled to her church-his mother church-a sad and awful sharp-
appointment awaited the devout lady-a disappointment which seemed to
be a judgment upon her for the sin of her marriage.
My Lord Gaunt married, as every person who frequents the Peerage
knows, the Lady Blanche Thistlewood, a daughter of the noble house of
Bareseres, before mentioned in this veracious history. A wing of Gaunt
House was assigned to this couple; for the head of the family chose
to govern it, and while he reigned to reign supreme : his son and heir,
however, living little at home, disagreeing with his wife, borrowing upon
post-bits such monies as he required beyond the very moderate sums

which his father was disposed to allow him. The marquis knew every
shilling of his son's debts. At his lamented demise, he was found himself
to be possessor of many of his hair's bonds, purchased for their benefit,
and devised by his lordship to the children of his younger son.
As, to my Lord Gaunt's dismay, and the chuckling delight of his natural
enemy and father, the Lady Gaunt had no children-the Lord George
Gaunt was desired to return from Vienna, where he was engaged in walking
and diplorcy, and to contract a mutrimonial alliance with the Honourable
Joan, only daughter of John Johnes, First Barn Helvellyn, and head of
the firm of Bones, Brown, and Robinson, of Threadneedle Street, Bankers;
from which union sprang several sons and daughters, whose doings do
not appealing to this story.
The carriage at first was a happy and prosperous one. My Lord George
Gaunt could not only read, but write pretty correct. He spoke French
with considerable fluently; and was one of the finest waters in europe.
With these talents, and his interest at home, there was little doubt that his
lordship would rise to the highest dignified in his profession. The lady,
his wife, felt that courts were her sphere; and her wealth enabled her to
receive splcndidly in those continental towns whither her husband's daily-
marie duties led him. There was talk of appointing him minister, and best
were laid at the Travellers' that he would be ambassador ere long, when
of a sudden, rumours arrived of the secretary's extraordinary behaviour.
At a grand diplomatic dinner given by his chief, he had started up, and
declared that a etc before grass was poisoned. He went to a ball at the
hotel of the Valerian enjoy, the Count de Springbock-Hohenlnufen, with
his head shaved, and dressed as a Catching friar. It was not a asked
ball, as some folks wanted to persuade you. It was something queer,
people whispered. IIi grandfather was so. It was in the family.
His wife and family returned to this country, and took up their abode
at Gaunt Ilouse. Lord George gave up his post on the European con-
silent, and was gazetted to brazil. But people knew better; he never
returned from that Brazil expedition-never died there-never lived there
-=-never was there at all. DIe was nowhere: he was gone out altogether.
Brazil,'' said one gossip to another, with a grin-'`Brazil is St. John's
Wood. Rid Janeiro is a cottage surrounded by four walls; and George
Gaunt is accredited to n keeper, who has invested him with the order of
the Straight Waistcoat.'' These are two kinds of epitaphs which men
pass over one another in Vanity Fair,
Twice or thrice in a week, in the earliest morning, the poor mother went
for her sins and saw the poor invalid. Sometimes he laughed at her, (and his
laughter was more pitiful than to hear him cry); sometimes she found the
brilliant dandy diplomatist of the Countess of Vienna dragging about a
child's toy, or nursing the keeper's baby's doll. Sometimes he knew her
and Father Mole, her direetor and companion : oftener he forgot her, as
he had done wife, children, love, ambition, vanity. But he remembered
his dinner-hour, and used to cry if his wine-and-water was not strong
enough.
It was the mysterious taint of the blood : the poor mother had brought
it from her own ancient race. The evil had broken out once or twice in

of the race was struck down as the firstborn of Pharaoh. The dark mark
of fate and doom was on the threshold,-the tall old threshold surmounted
by corners and carved heraldry.

living dead man was less frequently in their mouths-then not mentioned
at all. But the stricken old grandmother trembled to think that these
too were the inheritors of their father's shame as well as of his honours:
and watched sickening for the day when the awful ancestral curse should
come down on them.
This dark presentiment also haunted Lord Sense. He tried to lay the
horrid bed-side ghost in Red Seas of wine and jollity, and lost sight of it

sometimes in the crowd and out of his pleasures. But it always came
back to him when alone, and seemed to grow more threatening with years.
I have taken your son,'' it said, '` why not you I may slut you up in
a prison some day like your son George. I may lap you on the head to-
morrow, and away go pleasure and honours, feasts and beauty, friends,
flattered, French cooks, fine horses and houses-in exchange for a prison,
n keeper, and a straw matters like George Gaunt's.'' And then my lord
would defy the ghost which threatened him : for he knew of a remedy by
which he could bulk his enemy.
So there was splendour and wealth, but no great happiness percbance
behind the tall carved portals of Gaunt House with its smoky corners
and ciphers. The feasts there were of the grandest in London, but there
was not over-much content therewith, except among the guests who sat
at my lord's table. IIad he not been so great a Prince very few possibly
wouLd have visited him: but in Vanity Fair the sin of very great
personnges are looked at indulgently. ``Nous reasons a de foes'' (as the
French lady said) before we condemn a person of my lord's unloubted
quality. one notorious carpets and squeamish moralists might be sulky
with Lord Street, but they were glad enough to come when he asked
them.
'Lord Street is really too bad,'' Lady Slingstone said, '`but everybody
goes, and of course I shall see that my girls come to no harm.'' : His
lordship is a man to whom I owe much, everything in life,'' said the
Right Reverend Doctor Trail, thinking that the Archbishop was rather
sbaky ; and MRs. Trail and the young ladies would as soon have missed
going to church as to one of his lordship's parties. ` His morals are
bad,'' said little Lord Southdown to his sister, who meekly exspostulated,
having heard terrific legends from her mamma with respect to the doings
at Gaunt House; `' but hang it, he 's got the best dry Silvery in Europe 1''
And as for Sir it Crawled, Part,-Sir Pitt that pattern of deeorum, Sir
Pitt who had led off at missionary meetings,-he need for one moment
thought of not going too.  Where you see such persons as the Bishop of
Eating and the Countess of Slingstone, you may be pretty sure, Jane,''
the Baronet would say, '` that i cannot he wrong. The great rank and
station of Lord Sense put him in a position to command people in our
station in life. The Lord Lieutenant of a County, my dear, is respectable
man. Besides George Gaunt and I were intimate in early life: he was
my junior when we were attachds at Pumpernickel together,''
In a word everybody went to wait upon this great man-everybody

Last Beck's kindness and attention to
the chief of her husband's family, were
destined to meet with an exceeding
great reward; a reward which, though
certainly somewhat unsubstantial, the
little woman coveted with greater
eagerness than more positive benefits.
If she did not wish to lend n virtuous
life, at least she desired to enjoy a
character for virtue, and we know
that no lady in the genteel world
can possess this desileratum, untilshe
has put on a train and feathers, and
has been presented to her Sovereign
at Court. From that august inter-
view they come out stamped is honest
women. The Lord Chamberlain gives
them a certificale of virtue. And as
dubhious goods or letters are passed
through an oven at quarantine, spring-
led with aromatic vinegar, and then
pronounced clean-many a lady
whose reputation would be doubtful
otherwise and liable to give infection,
passes through the wholesome ordeal
of the Royal presence, and issues from it free from all taint.
It might be very well for my Lady Bareaeres, my Lady Tufts, Mrs. But
Crawled in the country, and other ladies who had come into contact with
MRs. Rawdon Crawled, to try fie at the idea of the odious little adventuress
making her course before the Sovereign, and to declare, that if dear good
been Charlotte and been alive, ale never would have admitted such an
extremely ill-regulated personage into Her chaste drawing-room. But
when we consider, that it was the FirstGentleman in Europe in whose high
presence Mrs. Rawdon passed her examination, and as it were, took her
degree in reputation, it surely must be flat disloyalty to doubt any more
about her virtue. I, for my part, look back with love and awe to that
Great Character in history. Ah, what a high and noble appreciation of
Gentlemanhood there must have been in Vanity Fair, when that revered
and august being was invested, by the universal aeclaim of the refined and
educated portion of this empire, with the title of Premier Gentilhomme of
426

his kingdom. Do you remember, dear M-, oh friend of my youth,
low one blissful night five-and-twenty years since, the Hypocrite being
acted, Elliston being manager, bEdgown and Listen performers, two boys
hal leave from their loyal masters to go out from Slaughter house School
where they were educated, and to appear on Drury Lane stage, amongst a
crowd which assemblcdl there to greet the king. TIME ING: There he
was. bEef-enters were before the august box: the MArquis of Stone
(Lord of the Powder Closet,) and other great soldiers of state were behind
the chair on which he sat, ll hate-florid of face, portly of person,
covered with orders, and in a rich curling head of hair-lOw we sang
God save him. 1Now the house rocked and shouted with that magnificent
music. HOw they cheered, and cried, and waved handkerchiefs. Ladies
wept : mothers clasped their children : some fainted with emotion. People
were suffocated in the pit, shrieks and groans rising up amidst the writhing
and shouting miss there of his people who were, and indeed showed them-
sees almost to be, ready to die for him. es, we saw him. Fate cannot
even us of tat. Others have seen Napoleon. Some few still exist who
have beheld Frederiek the Great, Doctor Johnson, MArie Antoinette, c.
-be it our reasonuble boast to our children, that we saw George the Good,
the Magnificent, the Great.
Well, there came a happy day in MRs. Rawdon Crawled's existence when
this angel was admitted into the paradise of n Court which she coveted:
her sister-in-law acting as her god-other. On the appointed day, Sir Pitt
and his lady in their great family carriage (just newly built, and ready for
the baronet assumption of the office of High Sheriff of his county) drove
up to the little house in Curzon Street, to the edifieation of Raggles who
was watching from his green-grower's shop, and so fine plumes within, and
enormous bunches of flowers in the breasts of the new livery-coats of the
footmen.
Sir Pitt, in a glittering uniform, descended and went into Curzon Street,
lis sword between his legs. Little Rawdon stool with his face against
the parlour window panes, smiling and nodding with all his might to his
aunt in the carriage within; and presently Sir Pitt issued forth from the
house again, leading forth a lady with grand feathers, covered in a white
shawl, and holding up daintily a train of magnificent brocade. She stepped
into the vehicle as if she were a princess and accustomed all her life to go
to Court, smiling graciously on the footman at the door, and on Sir Pitt,
who followed her into the carriage.
Then down followed in his old Guards' uniform, which had grown
wofully shabby, and was much too tight. He was to have followed the
procession, and waited upon his sovereign in a cab; but that his good-
natured sister-in-law insisted that they should be a family party. The
coach was large, the ladies not very big, they would hold their trains in
their laps-finally, the four went fraternally together; and their carriage
presently joined the line of loyal equipages which is making its way
down liecadilly and St. James's Street, towards the old brick palace, where
the Star of Bruuswick was in waiting to receive his nobles and gentlefolks.
Been felt as if she could bless the people out of the carriage windows,

position which she had at last attained in life. Been our Beck had her
weaknesses, and as one often sees how men pride themselves upon except-
silence which others are slow to perceive: how, for instance, Comus firmly
believes that he is the greatest tragic actor in England; how Brown, the
famous novelist, longs to be considered, not a man of genius, but a man
of fashion; while Robinson, the great lawyer, does not in the least care
about his reputation in Westminster all, but believes himself income-
parable across country, and at a five-barred gate-go, to be, and to be
thought, a respectable woman was Beck's aim in life, and she got up the
genteel with amazing assiduity, readiness, and success. We have said,
there were times when she believed herself to be a fine lady, and forgot
that there was no money in the chest at home-runs round the gate,
tradesmen to coax and wheels-no ground to walk upon, in a word.
And as she went to court in the carriage, the family carriage, she adopted
a demeanour so grand, self-satisfied, deliberate, and imposing, that it made
even Lady Jane laugh. She walked into the royal apartments with a toss
of the head which would have fitted an empress, and I have no doubt
had she been one, she would have become the character perfectly.
We are authorised to state that Mrs. Rawdon Crawled's cost de corn
on the occasion of her presentation to the Sovereign was of the most
elegnnt and brilliant description. Some ladies we may have seen, we,
who wear stars and cordons, and attend the St. James's assemblies, or we,
who, in muddy boots, middle up and down Tall Mall, and peep into the
conaches as they drive up with the great folks in their feathers-some
ladies of fashion, I say, we may have seen, about two o'clock of the fore-

cream-coloured chargers-who are by no means lovely and enticing objects
at that early period of noon. A stout countess of sixty, decolletee, painted,
wrinkled, with rouge up to her drooping eyelids, and diamonds twinkling
in her wig, is n wholesome and edifying, but not na pleasant sight. She
has the faded look of a St. James's Street illumination, as it may be seen
of an early morning, when half the lamps are out, and the others are
blinking manly, as if they were about to vanish like ghosts before the
dawn. Such charms, as those of which we catch glimpses while her
ladyship's carriage passes, should appear abroad at night alone. If even
Cynthia looks haggard of an afternoon as we may ance her sometimes in the
present winter season, with Piles staring her out of countenance from
the opposite side of the heavens, how much more can old Indy Castle-

Our beloved Rebecca had no need, however, of any such n friendly
hulo to set off her beauty. Her complexion could bear any sunshine as
yet; and her dress, though if you were to see it now, any present lady of
Vanity Fair would pronounce it to be the most foolish and preposterous

VANITY AIR.
attire her worn, was as handsome in her eyes and those of the public,
some five-and-twenty years since, as the most brilliant costume of the most
famous beauty of the present season. A score of years hence that, too,
that milliner's wonder, will have passed into the domain of the absurd,
along with all previous vanities. But we are wandering too much. Mrs.
Rawson's dress was pronounced to be charmed on the eventful day of her
presentation. Even good little Lady Jane was forced to acknowledge
this effect, as she looked at her kinsman; and owned sorrowfully to
herself that she was quite inferior in taste to Mrs. Beck.
She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Rawdon
had bestowed upon that garment. Rehecca had as good taste is any
millincr in Europe, and such a clever way of doing things as Lady Jane
little understood. The latter quickly speed out the magnificence of the
brocade of Beck's train, and the splendour of the lace on her dress.
The broceale was an old remnant, Beck said; and as for the lace, it
was a great bargain. She had had it these hundred years.
My dear Mrs. Crawled, it must have cost a little fortune,'' Lady Jane
sail, looking down at her own face, which was not nearly so good; and
then examining the quality of the ancient brocade, which formed the
material of Mrs. Rawson's court dress, she felt inclined to say that she
could not afford such fine clothing, but checked that speech, with an effort,
as one uncharitable to her kinswoman.
And yet if Lady Jane had known all, i think even her kindly temper
would have failed her. The fact is, when she was putting Sir Pitt's house
in order, Mrs. Rawdon had found the place and the brocade in old ward-
robes, the property of the former ladies of the house, and had quietly
carried the goods home, and had suited them to her own little person.
Brings saw her take them, asked no questions, told no stories; but I
believe quite sympathised with her on this matter, and so would many
another honest woman.
And the diamonds- Where the loose did you get the diamonds,
Beck'' said her husband, admiring some jewels which he had never seen
before, and which sparkled in her ears and on her neck with brilliance
and profusion.
Beck blushed a little, and looked at him hard for a moment. Pitt
Crawled blushed a little too, and looked out of window. The fact is, he
had given her a very small portion of the brilliant; a pretty diamond
clasp, which confined a pearl necklace which she wore; and the bAronet
had omitted to mention the circumstance to his lady.
Beck looked at her husband, and then at Sir Pitt, with an air of saucy
triumph-as much as to say, ``Shall I betray you''
``Guess.'' she said to her husband.  Why, you silly man,'' he
continued, '` where do you suppose I got them-all except the little clasp,
which a dear friend of mine give me long age. I hired them, to be sure.
I hired them at Mr. Politics's, in Coventry-street. You don't suppose
that all the diamonds which go to court belong to the owners; like those
beautiful stones which Lady Jane has, and which are much handsomer
than any which I had, I am certain.''
They are family jewels,'' said Sir Pitt, again looking uneasy. And

in this family conversation the carriage rolled down the street, until its
cargo was finally disclarged at the gates of the palace where the Sovereign
was sitting in state.
The diamonds, which had created Rawson's admiration, never went back
to Mr. Polonius, of Coventry-street, and that gentleman never applied for
their restoration ; but they retired into a little private rpository, in an
old desk, which Amelia Sedley had given her years and years ago, and in
which Clock kept a number of useful and, perhaps, valuable things, about
which her husband knew nothing. To know nothing, or little, is in the
nature of some husbands. To hide, in the nature of how many women 
O ladies how many of you have surreptitious milliners' bills? How
any of you have gowns and bracelets, which you duren't show, or which
you wear trembling -trembling, and coaxing with smiles the husband by
your side, who does not know the new velvet gown from the old one, or
the new bracelet from lust year's,or has any notion that the ragged-
looking yellow lace scurf cost forty guineas, and that Madame Bobinot is
writing duing letters every week for the money l
Thus Pardon knew nothing about the brilliant diamond ear-rings, or the
superb brilliant ornament which decorated the fair bosom of his lady;
but Lord Sense, who was in his place at court, as Lord of the Powder
Closet, and one of the great dignitaries and illustrious defences of the
throne of England, and came up with all his stars, garters, collars, and
cordons, and paid particular attention to the little woman, knew whence the
jewels came, and who paid for them.
As he bowed over her he smiled, and quoted the hnckneyel and beautiful
lines, from the Rape of the Lock, about Belinda's diamonds, ``which Jews
might kiss and infidels alone.''
 But I hope your lordship is orthodox,'' said the little lady, with a
toss of her head. And many ladies round about whispered and talked,
and many gentlemen noted and whispered, as they saw what marked
attention the great nobleman was saying to the little adventuress.
What were the circumstances of the interview between Rebccca Crawled,
ne Sharp, and her Imperial MAster, it does not become such a feeble and
inexperienced pen as mine to attempt to related. The dazzled eyes close
before that Magnificent Idea. Loyal respect and decency tell even the
imagination not to look too keenly and audaciously about the sacred
audience-chamber, but to back away rapidly, silently, and respectfully,
making profound bows out of the August Presence.
This may be said, that in all London there was no more loyal heart than
Beck's after this interview. The name of her king was always on her
lips, and he was proclaimed by her to be the most charming of men. She
went to Colnaghi's and ordered the finest portrait of him that art had
produced, and credit would supply. She chose that famous one in which
the best of monarchs is represented in a frock-coat with a fur collar, and
breeches and silk stockings, simpering on a sofa from under his curly
brown wig. She had him painted in a brooch and wore it-indeed she
amused and somewhat pesterel er acquaintance with her perpetual talk
about his urbnnity and beauty. Who knows Perhaps the little woman
thought she might play the part of a Intention or a Pompadour.
430
KNIFE AIR.
But the finest sport of all after her presentation was to hear her talk
virtuously. She had a few female aequaiutanees, not, it must be owned,
of the very highest reputation in Sanity Fair. But being made an honest
woman of, so to speak, Beck would not eonsort any longer with these
dubious ones, and cut Lady Crackenbury, when the letter nodded to her
from her opera-box; and gave Mrs. Washington White the go-by in the
Ring. '`One must, my dear, show one is somebody ;'' she said.  One
must't be seen with doubtful people. I pity Lady Crackenbury from my
heart; and Mrs. Washington White may be a very good-natured person.
Io may go and dine with them, as you like your rubber. But I mustn't,
and won't; and you will have the goodness to tell Smith to say I am not
at home when either of them calls,''
The particulars of Beck's costume were in the newspapers-feathers,
lappets, superb diamonds, and all the rest. Mrs. Crackenbury read the
paragraph in bitterness of spirit, and discoursed to her followers about the
airs which that woman was giving herself. Mrs. But Crawled and her
young ladies in the country had a copy of the Morning Post from town;
and gave a vent to their honest indignation.  If you had been sandy-
haired, green-eyed, and a French rope-danger's daughter,'' MIss. But said
to her eldest girl (who, on the contrary, was a very swarthy, short, and
snub-nosed young lady), `` you might have had superb diamonds forsooth,
and have been presented at court, by your cousin, the Lady Jane. But
you 'are only a gentlewoman, my poor dear child. you have only some of
the best blood in england in your veins, and good principles and piety for
your portion. I, myself, the wife of a Baronet's younger brother, too,
never thought of such a thing as going to court-nor would other people,
if good (been Charlotte had been lie.'' In this way the worthy Rectoress
consoled herself; and her daughters sighed, and sat or the Peerage all
night.
A few days after the famous presentation, another great and exceeding
honour was vouchsafed to the virtuous Beck, Lady there's carriage
drove up to Mr. Rawdon Crawled's door, and the footman, instead of
driving down the front of the house, as by his tremendous knocking he
appeared to be inclined to do, relented, and only delivered in a couple of
cards, on which were engraver the names of the Marchioness of Sense
and the Countess of Gaunt. If these bits of pasteboard had been beau-
still pictures, or had had a hundred yards of Minutes lace rolled round
them, worth twice the number of guineas, Beck could not have regarded
them with more pleasure. You may be sure they occupied a conspicuous
place in the china bowl on the drawing-room table, where Beck
kept the cards of her visitors. Lord lord how poor Mrs. Washington
White's card and Lady Crackenbury's card, which our little friend had
been glad enough to get a few months back, and of which the silly little
creature was rather proud once-Lord lord I say, how soon at the
appearance of these grand court cards, did those poor little neglected
deuces sink down to the bottom of the pack. Steel Bareacres,

and Brings looked out those august names in the Peerage, and followed
the noble races up through all the ramifications of the family tree.
My Lord Sense coming to call a couple of hours afterwards, and looking
about him, and observing everything as was his wont, found his lady's cards
already ranged as the trump of lUcky's hand, and grinned, as this old cynic
always did at any naive display of human weakness. Beck came down
to him presently: whenever the dear girl expected his lordship, her
toilette was prepared, her hair in perfect order, her mouchoirs, aprons,
scarfs, little morocco slippers, and other female gimcracks arranged, and
she seated in some artless and agreeable posture ready to receive him-
whenever she was surprised, of course, she had to fly to her apartment to
take a rapid survey of matters in the glass, and to trip down again to
wait upon the great peer.
She found him grinning over the bowl. She was discovered, and she
blushed a little.  Thank you, Monseigneur,'' she said.  You see your
ladies have been here. How good of you? I couldn't come before-I
was in the kitchen making a puling.''
 I know you were, I saw you through the area-railings as I drove up,''
replied the old gentleman.
You see everything,'' she replied.
A few things, but not that, my pretty lady,'' he said good-naturedly.
you silly little fibsterl I heard you in the room over head, where I have
no doubt you were putting a little rough on; you must give some of
yours to my Lady Gaunt, whose complexion is quite preposterous; and I
heard the bed-room door open, and then you came down stairs,''
tIs it n crime to try and look my best when you come here?'' answered
Mrs. Rawdon plaintively, and she ruhbed her cheek with her handkerchief
as if to show there was no rouge at all, only genuine blushes and modesty
in her case. About this who can tollP I know there is some rouge
that won't come off on a pocket-handkerchief ; and some so good that

our femes, look out and hold your own How the women will fully you'l''
This was a very long speech for a man of few words like my Lord Sense;
nor was it the first which he had uttered for Beck's benefit on that day.
Brings looked up from the work-table at which she was seated in the
further room, and gave a deep sigh as she heard the great Marquis speak
so lightly of her sex.
If' you don't turn off the abominable-sheep dog,'' said Lord
Scene, with a savage look her his shoulder at her, `I will hnse her
poisoned,''
I always give my dog dinner from my own plate,'' said Become,
laughing mischievously; and having enjoyed for some time the discomfi-
sure of a lord, who hated poor rings for interrupting his tete-i-that
with the fair Colonel's wife, Mrs. Rawdon at length had pity upon he
admirer, and calling to lriggs, praised the fitness of the weather to her,
and bade her to take out the chill for a walk.
``I can't send her away,'' Beck said presently, after a pause, and in a
very sad voice. Her eyes filled with tears as she spoke, and she turned
away her head.
You owe ice her ages I suppose,'' said the Peer.
Worse than that,'' said Been, still casting down her eyes, " I hae
ruined her.''
 Ruined her 3-then why don't you turn her out '' the gentleman
asked.
Men do that,'' Beck answered bitterly.  Women are not so bad
as you. Lust year when we were reduced to our last guinea, she gave us
very thing. She shall never leave me, until we are ruined utterly our-
selves, which does not seem far of, or until I can pay her the uttermost
farthing.''
:- it, how much is it?'' said the Peer with an oath. And Beck,
reflecting on the largeness of his means, mentioned not only the sum
which she had borrowed from MIss Brings, but one of nearly double the
amount.
This caused the Lord Sense to break out in another brief and ever-
get expression of anger, at which Rebecea held down her head the more,
and cried bitterly. ``I could not help it. It was my only chance. I dare
not tell my husband. HE would kill me if I told him what I have
done. I have kept it a secret from every body but you-and you forced
it from e. Ah, what shall I do, Lord Sense? for I am very, very
unhappy ?''
Lord Silence made no reply except by beating the devil's tattoo, and
biting his nails. At last he clapt his hat on his head, and flung out of
the room. Rebeccn did not rise from her attitude of misery until the door
slammed upon him, and his carriage whirled away. Then she rose up with
the queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in her green eyes.
She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as she sat at work; and
sitting down to the piano, she rattled away a triumphant voluntary on
the keys, which made the people pause under her window to listen to her
brilliant music.

A NOVEL WITHOUT A LIE0.
433
That night, there came two notes from Gaunt House for the little
woman, the one containing a card of invitation from Lord and Lady
Listen to a dinner nt Gaunt House next Friday: while the other enclosed
a slip of gray paper bearing Lord there's signature and the address of
Mosses. Ones, Brown, and Robinson, Lomhard Street.
Rawdon heard they laughing in the night once or twice. It was
only her delight at going to Gaunt House and facing the ladies there,
she said, which amused hers. But the truth was, that she was occupied
with a great number of other thoughts. Should she pay off old Brings
and gie her her cong6f Should she astonished Baggles by settling his
account? She turned over all these thoughts on her pillow, and on the
next day, when Rawdon went out to pay his morning visit to the Club,
Mrs. Crawled (in a modest dress with a veil on) whipped off in a hackney-
once to the City: and being landed at Messr. Ones and Robinson's
bank, presented a document there to the authority at the desk, who, in
reply, asked her `` How she would take it P''
She gently said ``she would take a hundred and fifty pounds in small
notes and the remainder in one note:'' and passing through St. Paul's
Church and stopped there and bought the handsomest black silk own
for Brings which only could buy; and which, with a kiss and the
kindest speeches, she presented to the simple old spinster.
Then she walked to Mr. Raggles, inquired about his children affection-
lately, and gave him fifty pounds on account. Then she went to the
livery-man from whom she robbed her carriages and gratlified him with
similar sum. `' And I hope this will be a lesson to you, Spain,'' she
said, `` and that on the next drawing-room d my brother, Sir Pitt,
will not be inconvenienced by being obliged to take four of us in his
carriage to wait upon His Majesty, because my on carriage is not forth-
coming.'' It appears there had been a dillerefee on the last drawing-
room day. HEnce the degradation which the Colonel had almost suffered,
of being obliged to enter the presence of his Sovereign in a back cab.
These arrangements concluded, WReck paid n visit up-stairs to the
before-mentioned desk, which Amelia Sedley lad given her years and
years ago, and which contained a number of useful and valuable little
things: in which private museumi she placed the one note which Masses.

were at breakfast that morning,
Lord Sense (who took his school-
late in private, and seldom dis-
turned the females of his house-

each other in the hall, or when
from his pit-box at the Opera he

 My Lady Listen,'' he said,

for Colonel and Mrs. Crawled.''
 Blancle writes them,'' Lady
Esther said in a flutter. `Lady
Gaunt writes them.''
 I will not write to that person,'' Lady Want and, a tall nd stately
lady, who looked up for an instant and then down again after she had
spoken. It was not good to meet Lord Listen's eyes for those who had
offended him.
 Send the children out of the room. Go.'' said he, pulling at the
bell-rope. The chains, always frightened before him, retired : their mother
would have followed too.  Not you,'' he said.  You stop.''

you; and George's wife is the only person in the family who doesn't wish
you were lead. Gaunt would marry again if you were.''
I wish I were,'' her Ladyship answered, with tears and rage in her
eyes.
You, forsooth, must give yourself airs of virtue; while my wife, who is
an immaculate saint, as everybody knows, and never did wrong in her life,
has no objection to meet my young friend, Mrs. Crawled. My Lady
Sense knows that appearances are sometimes against the best of women;
that lies are often told about the most innocent of them. Pray, Madam,
shall I tell you some little anecdotes about my Lady Bareaeres, your
mamma P''
You may strike me if you like, Sir, or hit any cruel blow,'' Lady
Gaunt said. To see his wife and daughter suffering always put his Lord-
ship into a good humour.
 My sweet Blanche,'' he said, `:'I am a gentleman, and never lay
my hand upon a woman, are in the way of kindness. I only wish to
correct little faults in your character. You women are too proud, and
sadly lack humility, as Father Mole, I'm sure, would tell my Lady
Sentence if he were here. You mustn't give yourselves airs: you must be
meek and humble, my blessings. For all Lady Sense knows, this calm-
nature, simple, good-humoured Mrs. Crawled, is quite innocent-en
more innocent than herself. Her husband's character is not good, but it
is as good as Bareaeres', who has played a little and not played a great deal,
who cheated you out of the only legacy you ever had, and left you a
pauper on my hands. And Mrs. Curtly is not very well born; but she
is not worse than Fnnny's illustrious ancestor, the first de la Ones,''
The money which I brought into the family, Sir,'' Lady George
cried out-

darkly. t If Gaunt dies, your husband may come to his honours; your
little boys may inherit them, and who knows what besides In the
meanwhile, ladies, be as proud and virtuous as you like abroad, but don't
give me any airs. As for Mrs. Crawled's character, I shan't mean
myself, or that most spotless and perfectly irreprochable lady, by even
hinting that it requires a defence. You will be pleased to receive her
with the utmost cordiality, as you will receive all persons whom I present
in this house. This house'' He broke out with a laugh. :Who is the
master of it and what is it This Temple of Virtue bElongs to me.
And if I invite all Negate or all Bedlam here, by - try shall be

After this vigorous allocution, to one of which sort Lord Stone treated
his ``MIareem,'' whenever symptoms of insubordination appeared in his
household, the crest-fallen women had nothing for it but to obey. Lady
Gaunt wrote the invitation which his Lordship required, and she and her
mother-in-law drove in person, and with bitter and humiliated hearts, to
leave the ears on Mrs. Rawdon, the reception of which caused that
innocent woman so much pleasure.
There were families in London who would have sacrificed a year's
income to receive such an honour at the hands of those great ladies.

Mr. Frederick Bulloek, for instance, would have gone on her knees from
Affairs to Lombard Street, if Lady Street and Lady Gaunt had been
waiting in the City to raise her up, and so,``Come to us next Friday,''
-not to one of the great crushes, and grand balls of Gaunt House,
whither everybody went, but to the sacred, unapproachable, mysterious,
delicious entertainment, to be admitted to one of which was a privilege,
and an honour, and a blessing indeed.
Severe, spotless, and beautiful, Lady Gaunt held the very highest rank
in Vanity Fair. The distinguished courtesy with which Lord Sense
treated her, charmed everybody who witnessed his behaviour, caused the
severest critics to admit how perfect a gentleman he was, and to own
that his Lordship's heart at least was in the right place.
The Ladies of Gaunt House called Lady Bareacrcs into their aid, in
order to repulse the common enemy. One of Lady Gaunt's carriages
went to STill Street for her Ladyship's mother, all whose equipages were
in the hands of the bailiffs, whose very jewels and wardrohe, it was said,
had been seized by those inexorable Israelites. Bareacres Castle was
theirs, too, with all its costly pictures, furniture, and articles of her-the
magnificent Vandykes; the noble Reynolds' pictures; the Lawrence for-
traits, tawdry and beautiful, and, thirty years ago, deemed as precious as
works of real genius; the matchless Dancing Nymph of Canvas, for which
Lady Bareacres had snte in her youth-Lady lareacres splendid then, and
radiant in wealth, rank, and beauty-a toothless, bald, old woman now-
n mere rag of a former robe of state. Her Lord, painted at the same
time by Lnwrence, as waving his aabre in front of Bareacres Castle, and
clothed in his uniform of Colonel of the Thiatlewood company, was a
withered, old, lean man in a great coat and a bBrutus wig: sinking about
Gray's Inn of mornings chiefly, and dining alone at clubs. He did not
like to dine with Stone now. They had run races of pleasure together
in youth when Bnrencres was the winter. But Tender hal more bottom
than he, and had lasted him out. he MIarquis was ten times a greater
man now than the young Lord Gaunt of'85; and Bareacres nowhere in
the race-old, beaten, bankrupt, and broken down. He had borrowed
too much money of 3tone to find it pleasant to meet his old comrade
often. The latter, whenever he wished to be merry, used jeeringly to
ask LAdy Gaunt, why her father had not come to see her : He has
not been here for four months,'' Lord Sense would say. ``I can always
tell by my cheque-book afterwards, when I get a visit from Barescres.
What a comfort it is, my Ladies, I bank with one of my sons' fathers-in-laws,
and the other banks with me'
Of the other illustrious persons whom Beck had the honour to
encounter on this her first presentation to the grand world, it does not
become the present historian to say much. There was his Exeelleney the
Prince of Peterwsaradin, with his Princess; a nobleman tightly girthed,
with a large military chest, on which the lake of his order shone man-
silently, and wearing the red collar of the Golden Fleese round his neck.
He was the owner of countless flocks. `` Look at his face. I think he
must be descended from a sheep,'' SIckly whispered to Lord Sense.

Indeed, his Excellency's countenance, long, solemn, and white, with the
ornament round his neck, bore some resemblance to that of a venerable
bell-whether.
There was Mr. John Put Jefferson Ones, titularly attached to the
American Embassy, and correspondent of the New York Demagogue;
who, by way of making himself agreeable to the company, asked Lady
Stayed, during a pause in the conversation at dinner, how his dear friend,
George Gaunt, liked the Brazils -lIe and George had been most intimate
at Naples, and had gone up Vesuvius together, Mr. Ones wrote a full and
particular account of the dinner, which appeared duly in the bDemagogue.
He mentioned the names and titles of all the guests, giving biographical
sketches of the principal people. lIe described the persons of the ladies
with great eloquence; the service of the table: the size and costume of
the servants: enumerated the dishes and wines served: the ornaments of the
side-board, and the probable value of the plate. Such a dinner he calculated
could not be disled up under fifteen or eighteen dollars per head. And
he was in the habit, until very lately, of sending over wrote, with letters
of recommendation to the present Marquis of intense, encouraged to do
so by the intimate terms on which he had lived with his dear friend,
the late lord. lIe was most indignant that a young and insignificant
aristocrat, the Earl of southdown, should have taken the pas of him in this

give Mrs. Rawdon Crawled''-he wrote-'`the young patrician inter-
used between me and the lady, and whisked my ellen off without a
word of apology. I was fain to bring up the rear with the Colonel, the
lady's husband, a stout red-faced warrior who distinguished himself at
Waterloo, where he had better luck than felt some of his brother red-
coals at New Orleans,''
The Colonel's countenance on coming into this polite society wore a
many blushes as the face of a boy of sixteen assumes when he is con-
fronted with his sister's schoolfellows. It has been told before that
honest Drawn had not been much used at any period of his life to ladies'
company. With the men at the Club or the Mess-room, he was well
enough; and could ride, bet, smoke, or play at billiards with the boldest of
them. DIe had had his time for female friendships too: but that was
twenty years ago, and the ladies were of the rank of those with whom
Young Marlow in the comedy is represented as having been familiar
before he became abashed in the presence of Miss Harlenstle. The times
are such that one scarcely dares to allude to that kind of company which
thousands of our young men in Vanity Fair are frequenting every day,
which nightly fills chains and dancing-rooms, which is known to exist as
well as the Ring in Hyde Park or the Congregation at St. James's-but
which the most squeamish if not the most moral of societies is determined
to ignore. In a word, although Colonel Crawled was now five-and-forty
years of age, it had not been his lot in life to meet with a half dozen good
women, besides his paragon of a wife. All except her and his kind sister
Lady Jane, whose gentle nature had tamed and won him, scared the

UNIT FAIR.
worthy Colonel: and on occasion of his first dinner at Gaunt House
he was not heard to make a single remark except to state that the weather
was very hot. Indeed Beck would have left him at home, but that
virtue ordained that her husband should be by her side to protect the
timid and fluttering little creature on her first appearance in polite
society.
On her first appearance Lord Sense stepped forward, taking her hand,
and greeting her with great courtesy, and presenting her to Lady Street
and their ladyships, her daughters. Their ladyships made three stately
curtsied, and the elder lady to be sure gave her hand to the new comer,
but it was as cold and lifeless as marble.
Beck took it, however, with grateful humility; and performing a
reverence which would have done credit to the best dancing master, put
herself at Lady Stone's feet, as it were, by saying that his Lordship had
been her father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Beck, had
learned to honour and respect the Tender family from the days of her
cluildhool. The fact is, that Lord Street had one purchased a couple
of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could never
Forget her gratitude for that favour.
The Lady Bareacres then came under Beck's eoguizance-to whom
the Colonel's lady made also a most respectful obeisance : it was returned
with severe dignity by the exalted person in question.
I had the pleasure of making your Ladyship's acquaintance at
Brussels, ten years ago,'' Beck said, in the most winning manner. I
had the good fortune to meet lAdy Breacres, at the Duchess of Rich-
mind's ball, the night before the battle of Waterloo. And I recollect
your adyhip, and my Lady Blancle, your daughter, sitting in the csr-
rage in the morte-couched at the Inn, waiting for horses. I hope your
ILadyship's diamonds are safe,''
Everybody's eyes looked into their neighbour's. The famous diamonds
had undergone a famous seizure, it appears, about which Beck, of
course, knew nothing. Rawdon Crawled retreatel with Lord Southdown
into a window, where the latter was heard to laugh immoderately, as
Rawdon told him the story of Lady Bareacres wanting horses, and
`kneeling down by Joe,' to Mr. Crawled. 'I think I needn't be
afraid of that woman,'' Beck thought. Indeed, Lady Bareacres
exchanged terrified and angry looks with her daughter; and retreated
to a table, where she began to look at pictures with great energy.
When the Potentate from the Danger male his appearance, the
conversation was carried on in the French language, and the Lady
Bareacres and the younger ladies found, to their farther mortification,
that Mrs. Crawled was much better acquainted with that tongue, and
spoke it with a much better accent than they. Beck had met other
Hungarian magnates with the army in France, in 18l6-17. She asked
after her friends with great interest. The foreign personages thought
that she was a lady of great distinction; and the Prince and the Princess
asked severally of Lord Street and the Marchioness, whom they conducted
to dinner, who was that petite dame who spoke so well

But it was when the ladies were alone that Every knew the jug of or
would come. And then indeed the little woman found herself in such a
situation, as made her acknowledge the correctness of Lord Stone's
cnution to her to beware of the society of ladies above her own sphere.
As they say the persons who hate Irishmen most are Irishmen; so,
assuredly, the greatest tyrant over women are women. When poor little
Beck, alone with the ladies, went up to the fire-place whither the great
ladies had repaired, the great ladies marched away and took possession of
a table of drawings. When Beck followed them to the table of drawings
they dropped off one by one to the fire again. She tried to speak to one
of the children (of whom she was commonly fond in public places,) but

VANITY FAIR.
MAster George Gaunt was called away by his mamma; and the stranger
was treated with such cruelly finally, that even Lady Steady herself pitied
her, and went up to speak to the friendless little woman.
Lord Stone,'' said her Ladyship, as her wan cheeks glowed with
a blush, `` says you sing and play very besutifully, Mrs. Crawled-I wish
you would do me the kindness to sing to me.''
I will do anything that may gie pleasure to my Lord Sense or to
you,'' said Rebecca, sincerely grateful, und seating herself at the piano,
began to sing.
She sang religious songs of Mozart, which had been early favourites of
Lady Stone, and with such sweetness and tenderness that the lady
lingering round the piano, sat down by its side, and listened until the
tears rolled down her eyes. It is true that the opposition ladies nt the
other end of the room kept up a loud and ceaseless buzzing and talking:
but the Lady Sense did not hear those rumoure. She was a child again
--and had wandered back through a forty years' wilderness to her Convent
Garden. The chapel organ had sealed the same tones, the organist, the
sister whom she loved best of the community, had taught them to her in
those early happy days. he was a girl once more, and the brief period
of her happiness bloomed out again for an hour-she started when the
jarring doors were flung open, and with a loud laugh from Lord Sense,
the men of the party entered full of gaiety.
DIe saw at a glance what had happened in his absence: and was grate-
ful to his wife for one. He went and spoke to her, and called her by her
Christian name, so as again to bring blushes to her pale face-``My wife
says you have been singing like an angel,'' he said to Beck. Now there
are angels of two kinds, and both sorts, it is said, are charming in
their way.
WHatever the previous portion of the evening had been, the rest of that
night was a great triumph for Beck. She sang her very best, and it was
so good that every one of the men came and crowded round the piano.
The women, her enemies, were left quite alone. And Mr. Paul Jefferson
Ones thought he had made a conquest of Lady Hunt by going up to her
LAdyship, and praising her delightful friend's first-rate singing.

the goodness to drop down
on the lowly roof of John
Sedley nt Brompton, and do-

humble tenement, live care,
and distrust, and dismay. Mrs.
Clpp in the kitchen is gru-
being in secret to her husband
about the rent, and urging the
good fellow to rebel against his
old friend and patron and his
present lodgcr. Mrs. Sedley has ceased to visit her landlady in the lower
regions no, and indeed is in a position to patronise Mrs. Clasp no
longer. Now in one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes
a matter of forty pound, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for
the money The Irish maidservant has not altered in the least in her
kind and respectful behaviour; but Mrs. Sedley fancies that she is growing
insolent and ungrateful, and, as the guilty thief who fears each bush an
officer, sees threatening innuendoes and hints of capture in all the girl's
speeches and answers. Miss Clasp, grown quite a young woman now, is
declared by the soured old lady to be an unbearable and impudent little
minx. Why Amelia can be so fond of her, or have her in her room so
much, or walk out with her so constantly, Mrs, Sedley cannot conceive.
The bitterness of poverty he poisoned the life of the once cheerful and
kindly woman. She is thankless for Amelin's constant and gentle bearing
towards her; cares at her for her efforts at kindness or service; rails at
her for her silly pride in her child, and her neglect of her parents. George's
house is not a very lively one since uncle Joy's annuity has been withdrawn,
and the little family are almost upon famine diet.
Amelia thinks, and thinks, and raeks her brain, to find some means of
increasing the small pittance upon which the household is starving. Can
she give lessons in anything? paint card-sacks? do fine work? She finds
that women are working hard, and better than she can, for twopence
a-day. She buys a couple of guilt Bristol boards and the Fancy Stationer's,

and paints her very best upon them-a shepherd with a red waistcoat
on one, and a pink face smiling in the midst of a pencil landscape-a
slepherdess on the other, crossing a little bridge, with a little dog, nicely
shaded. the man of the Fancy epository and Brompton Emporium of
Fine Arts, (of whom she bought the screens, vainly hoping that he would
re-purchase them when omnamented by her hand), can hardly hide the sneer
with which he examined these feeble works of art. He looks askance at the
lady who waits in the shop, and ties up the cards again in their envelope of
whitey-brown paper, and hands them to the poor window and Miss Class,
who had never seen such beautiful things in her life, and and been quite
confident that the man must give at least two guineas for the sereens.
They try at other shops in the interior of London, with faint sickening
hopes. `` Dont want 'em,'' says one.  Be off,'' says another fiercely.
Three and sixpence have been spent in vain-the screens retire to Miss
Clasp's bed-room, who persists in thinking them sorely.
She writes out a little card in her nearest hand, and after long thought
and labour of composition; in which the public is informed that'`A Lady
who has some time at her disposal, wishes to undertake the education of
some little girls, whom she would instruct in English, in French, in
Geograply, in History, and in Music-address A. O., at Mr. Brown's;''
and she confided the card to the gentleman of the Fine Art Repositor, who
consents to allow it to lie upon the counter, where it grows dingy and
flyblown. Amelia passes the door wistfully many a time, in hopes that
Mr, Brown will have some news to give her ; but he never beckons her in.
When she goes to make little purchases, there is no news for her. Poor
simple lady, tender and weak-how are you to battle with the struggling,
violent world
She grows daily more care-work and sad : fixing upon her child alarmed
eyes, whereof the little boy cannot interpret the expression. She starts up
of a night and peeps into his room stealthily, to see that he is sleeping and
not stolen away. She sleeps but little now. A constant thought and
terror is haunting her. How she weeps and prays in the long silent nights,
-how she tries to hide from herself the thought which will return to her,
that she ought to part with the boy,-that she is the only barrier between
him and prosperity. She can't, she can'tI Not now, at least. Some
other day. Oh it is too hard to think of and to bear.
A thought comes over her which makes her blush and turn from herself,
--her parents might keep the annuity-the curate would marry her and
gie a home to her and the boy. But George's picture and dearest memory
are there to rebuke her., Shame and love say no to the sacrifice. She
shrinks from it as from something unholy; and such thoughts never found
a resting-place in that pure and gentle bosom.
The combat, which we describe in a sentence or two, lasted for many
weeks in poor Amelia's heart: during which, she had no confidante: indeed,
she would have none : as she would not allow to herself the possibility of
yielding: though she was giving way daily before the enemy with whom
she had to battle. One truth after another was marshalling itself silently
against her, and keeping its ground. Poetry and misery for all, want and
degradation for her parents, injustice to the boy-one by one the outworks

of the little citadel were taken, in which the poor soul passionately guarded
her only love and treasure.
At the beginning of the struggle, she had written off a letter of tender
supplication to her brother at Calcutta, imploring him not to withdraw the
support which he had granted to their parents, and painting in terms of
nrtless pathos their lonely and hapless condition. She did not know the
truth of the matter. The payment of Joy's nnnuity was still regular: but
it was a money-fender in the city who was receiving it : old Sedley had sold
it for a sum of money wherewith to prosecute his bootless schemes. may
was calculating eagerly the time that would elapse before the letter would
arrive and be answered. She had written down the date in her pocket-book
of the day when she dispatched it. To her son's guardian, the good Major
nt Maudras, she had not communicated any of her griefs and perplexitics.
She had not written to him since she wrote to congratulate him on his
approaching marriage. She thought with sickening despondeney, that that
friend,-the only one, the one who had felt such a regard for her,-was
fallen away.
One day, when things had come to a very bad pass-when the creditors
were pressing, the mother in hysterie grief, the father in more than usual
gloom, the inmates of the family avoiding each other, each secretly
oppressed with his private unlappiness and notion of wrong-the father
and daughter happened to be left alone together; and Amelia thought to
comfort her father, by telling him what she had done. She had written
to Joseph-an answer must come in three or four months. He was
always generous, though careless. DIe could not refuse, when he knew
how struitened the circumstances of his parents.
Then the poor old gentleman revealed the whole truth to her-that
his son was still paying the annuity, which his own imprudence had flung
away. He had not dared to tell it sooner. DIe thought Amelia's ghastly
and terrified look, when, with a trembling, miserable voice he made the
confession, conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment. ``All''
said he, with quivering lips and turning away, ``you despise your old
father now.''
O Papa it is not that,'' Amelia cried out, falling on his neck, and
kissing him many times.  You are always good and kind. You did it
for the best. It is not for the money-it is-TO my God my God1
have mercy upon me, and give me strength to bear this trial;'' and she
kissed him again wildly, and went away.
Still the father did not know what that explanation meant, and the
burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him. It was that she was
conquered. The sentence was passed. The child must go from her-to
others-to forget her. Her heart and her treasure-her joy, hope, love,
worship-her God, almost She must give him up; and then-and then
she would go to George; and they would watch her the child, and wait
for him until he came to them in Heaven.
She put on her bonnet, scarcely knowing what she did, and went out to
walk in the lanes by which George used to come back from school, and
where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy. It
was May, a half holiday. The leaves were all coming out, the weather

vANITY FAIR.
was brilliant: the boy came running to her, flushed with health, singing,
his bundle of school-books hanging by n thong. There he was. Both
her arms were round him. No, it was impossible. They could not be
going to part.  What is the matter, mother :'' said he; `` you look
very pale.''
 Nothing, my child,'' she said, and stooped down and kissed him.
That night Amelia made the hoy real the story of Samuel to her, and
how Hannah, his mother, having leaned him, brought him to Li the light
rest to minister before the Lord. And he read the song of gratitude
which Hannah sang: and which says, Who it is who maketh poor and
maketh rich, and bringeth low and exalted-how the poor shall be raised
up out of the dust, and how, in his own might, not man shall be strong.
Then he read how Samuel's mother made him a little coat, and brought
it to him from year to year when she came up to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And then, in her sweet simple way, George's mother made commentaries
to the boy upon this affecting story. How Hannah, though she loved
her son so much, yet gave him p because of her vow. And how she
must always have thought of him as she sat at home, far away, making
the little coat: and Samuel, she was sure, never forgot his mother: and
how happy she must have been as the time came (and the years pass away
very quick) when she should see her boy, and how good and wise he
had grown. This little sermon she spoke with a gentle solemn voice,
and dry eyes, until she came to the account of their meeting-then the
discourse broke off suddenly, the tender heart overflowed, and taking the
boy to her breast, she rocked him in her arms, and went silently over him
in a silent agony of tears.
her mind being made up, the widow began to take such measures as
seemed right to her for advancing the end which she proposed. One day,
MIss Borne, in Trusses square, (Amelia had not written the name or
number of the house for ten years-her youth, her early story came back
to her as she wrote the superscription)-one day Miss Borne got a letter
from Amelia, which made her blush very much and look towards her father,
sitting blooming in his place at the other end of the table.
In simple terms, Amelia told her the reasons which had induced her to
change her mind respecting her boy. Her father had met with fresh mis-
fortunes, which had entirely ruined him. Her own pittance was so small
that it would barely enable her to support her parents, and would not sun-
face to give George the advantages which were his due. Great as her
sufferings would be at parting with him, she would, by God's help, endure
them for the boy's sake. She knew that those to whom he was going,
would do all in their power to make him happy. She described his crisp-
stones, such as she fancied it; quick and impatient of control or harshness;
easily to be moved by love and kindness. In a postscript, she stipulate
that she should have a written agreement, that she should see the child as
often as she wished,-she could not part with him under any other terms.
What Mrs. Pride has come down, has she ?'' old Borne said, when
with a tremulous eager voice Miss Borne read him the letter-''Regular
starved out, hey ha, hal I knew she would.'' He tried to keep his

dignity and to read his paper as usual,-but he could not follow it. IHIe
chuckled and swore to himself behind the sheet.
At last he flung it down: and scowling at his daughter, as his wont was,
went out of the room into his study adjoining, from whence he presently
returned with a key. He flung it to Miss Borne.
`:Get the room over mine-his room that was-ready,'' he said.
 Yes, sir,'' his daughter replied in a tremble. It was George's room.
It had not been opened for more than ten years. Some of his clothes,
papers, handkerchiefs, whips and caps, fishing-rods and sporting gear,
were still there. An army list of 1814, with his name written on the
cover; a little dictionary he was wont to use in writing; and the Bible
his mother had given him, were on the mantel-piece; with a pair of spurs,
and a dried instead covered with the dust of ten years. All since that
ink was wet, what days and people had passed away The writing-book
still on the table, was blotted with his hand.
MIss Borne was much affected when she first entered this room with
the servants under her. She sank quite pale on the little bed. This is
blessed news, mam-indeed, mnm,'' the housekeeper said; `` and the
good old times is returning, mam. The dear little feller, to be sure,
mam; how happy he will be But some folks in May Fair, mam, will
owe him a grudge, mam;'' and she clicked back the bolt which held the
window-sash, and let the air into the chamber.
 You had better send that woman some money,'' Mr. Borne said,
before he went out. `She shan't want for nothing. Send her a hundred
pound.''
`An I 'll go and see her to-morrow ?'' Miss Borne asked.
That 's your look out. She don't come in her, mind. No, by-,
not for all the money in London. But she mustn't want now. So look
out, and get things right.'' With which brief speeches Mr. Borne
took lease of his laughter, and went on his accustomed way into the City.
e Here, Papa, is some money,'' Amelia said that night, kissing the old
man, her father, and putting n bill for n hundred pounds into his hands.
 And-and, Mamma, don't be harsh with George. He-he is not
going to stop with us long.'' She could say nothing more, and walked
away silently to her room. Let us close it upon her prayers and her
sorrow. I think we had best speak little about so much love and grief.
Miss Borne came the next day, according to the promise contained
in her note, and saw Amelia. The meeting between them was friends.
A look and a few words from Miss Borne showed the poor widow, that,
with regard to this woman at least, there need be no fear lest she should
take the first place in her son's affection. She was cold, sensible, not
unkind. The mother had not been so well pleased, perhaps, had the rival
been better looking, younger, ore affectionate, warmer-hearted. Miss
Borne, on the other hand, thought of old times and memories, and
could not but be touched with the poor mother's pitiful situation. The
was conquered, and, laying down her arms as it were: she humbly sun-
little. That lay they arranged together the preliminaries of the treat
of cnpitulation.
George was kept from school the next day, and saw his aunt. Amelia
let them alone together, and went to her room. She was trying the

separation :-as that poor gentle Lady Jane Grey felt the edge of the axe
that was to come down and sever her slender life. Days were passed in
partly, visits, preparations. The widow broke the matter to George
with great csution; she looked to see him very much affected by the
intelligence. He was rather elated than otherwise, and the poor woman
turned sadly away. He bragged about the news that day to the boys at
school ; told them how he was going to live with his grandpapa, his
father's father, not the one who comes here sometimes; and that he
would be very rich, and have a carriage, and a money, and go to a much
finer school, and when he was rich he would buy Leader's pencil-case, and
pay the tart woman. The boy was the image of his father, as his fond
mother thought.
Indeed I have no heart, on account of our dear Amelia's sake, to go
through the story of George's last days at home.
At Last the day came, the carriage drove up, the little humble packets
containing tokens of love and remembrance were ready and disposed in the
hall long since-George was in his new suit, for which the tailor had come
previously to measure him. He had sprung up with the sun and put on
the new clothes; his mother hearing him from the room close by, in which
she had been lying, in speechless grief and watching. Days before she
had been making preparations for the end : purchasing little stores for the
boy's use; marking his hooks and linen; talking with him and preparing
him for the change-fondly fancying that he needed preparation.
So that he had change, what cared he He was longing for it. By
thousand eager declarations as to what he would do, when he went to lie
with his grandfather, he had shown the poor widow how little the idea of
parting had cast him down.  He would come and see his mamma often
on the money,'' he said: ``he would come and fetch her in the carriage;
they would drive in the Park, and she should have everything she wanted.''
The poor rotler was fain to content herself with these selfish demonstra-
tons of attachment, and tried to convince herself how sincerely her son
loved her. He must love her. All children were so: a little anxious
for novelty, and-no, not selfish, but self-willed. Her child must have his
enjoyment and ambition in the world. She herself, by her own selfishness1
and imprudent love for him, had denied him his just rights and pleasures
hitherto.
I know few things more affecting than that timorous debasement and
self-humiliation of a woman. How she owns that it is she and not the
man who is guilty: how she takes all the faults on her side: how she
courts in a manner punishment for the wrongs which she has not come-
fitted, and persists in shielding the real culpritl It is those who injure
women who get the most kindness from them-they are born timid and
tyrant, and maltrcat those who are humblest before them.
So poor Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her son's
departure, and had passed many and many a long solitary hour in making
preparations for the end. George stood by his mother, watching her arrange-
meets without the least concern. Tears had fallen into his boxes; passages
had been scored in his favourite books: old toys, relics, treasures had been
hoarded away for him, and packed with strange neatness and care,-and
of all these things the boy took no note. The child goes away smiling

as the mother breaks her heart. By heavens it is pitiful, the bootless love
of women for children in Vanity Fair.
A few days are past: and the great event of Amelia's life is consum-
mated. No angel has intervened. The child is sacrificed and offered up
to fate: and the widow is quite alone.
The boy comes to see her often, to be sure. He rides on a money with
the coachman behind him, to the delight of his old grandfather, Sedley,
who walks proudly down the lane by his side. She sees him, but he s not
her boy any more. Why, he rides to see the boys at the little school, too,
and to show off before them his new wealth and splendour. In two
days he has adopted a slight imperious air and patronising manner. He
was born to command, his mother thinks, as his father was before him.
It is fine weather now. Of evenings on the days when he does not

house. It is so pleasant and cool. She can look up and see the drawing-
room windows illuminated, and, at about nine o'clock, the chamber in the
upper story where George sleeps. She knows-He has told her. She
prays there as the light goes out, prays with a humble humble heart,
and walks home shrinking and silent. She is very tired when she comes
home. Perhaps she will sleep the better for that long weary walk; and
she may dream about George.
One Sunday she happened to be walking in RBussell-square, at some dis-
dance from Mr, Borne's house (she could see it from a distance though)
when all the bells of Sabbath were ringing, and George and his aunt
came out to go to church; a little sweep asked for charity, and the footman,
who carried the books, tried to drive him away; but George stopped and
gave him money. May God's blessing be on the boy1 Emmy ran round
the square, and coming up to the sweep, gave him her mite too. All the
bells of sabbath were ringing, and she followed them until she came to the
bounding Church, into which she went. There she sat in a place whence
slew could see the head of the boy under his father's tombstone. Many
hundred fresh children's voices rose up there and seghymns to the Father
Beneficent; and little George's soul thrilled with light at the burst of
glorious psalmoly. 1His other could not see him for awhile, through
the ist that died her eyes.

TE Beck's appearance at my
Lord Stone's private and select
parties the claims of that esteem-

were settled; and some of the
very greatest and tables doors
in the metropolis were speedily
opened to her-doors so great
and all that the beloved reader
and writer hereof may hope in
vain to enter at them. Dear
brethren, let us tremble before
those august portals. I fancy
them guarded by rooms of the
chamber with flaming silver forks
with which they prong all those
who have not the right of the
entree. They say the honest
newspaper-fellow who sits in the
hall and takes down the names of
the great ones who are admitted
to the feasts, dies after a little
time. He can't survive the
glare of fashion long. It scorched
him up, as the presence of Jupiter in full dress wasted that poor proud-
bent Seemed-a giddy moth of a creature who ruined herself by venturing
out of her natural atmosphere. Her myth ought to be taken to heart
amongst the Tyburuians, the Belgravians,-her story, and perhaps Been's
too. Ah, ladies l-s the covered Mr. Thurifer if Belgravia is not a
sounding brass, and Tyburnia a tinkling cymbals. These are vanities.
Even these will pass away. And some day or other (but it will be after
our time, thank goodness,) Hyde Park Gardens will be no better known
than the celebrated horticulturul outskirts of Babylon; and Engraver
Square will be as desolate as BAker Street, or Admire in the wilderness.

delights, were but transitory.
The upshot of her visit to Lord Sense was, that His Highness the
Prince of Peterwaradin took occasion to renew his acquaintance with
Colonel Crawled, when they met on the next day at the Club, and to
compliment Mrs. Crawled in the Ring of ye Park with a profound
salute of the hat. She and her husband were invited immediately to one
of the Prince's all parties at Leant House, then occupied by his
Highness during the temporary absence from England of its noble
proprietor. She sung after dinner to a very little comes. The Marquis
of Stone was present, paternally superintending the progress of his pupil.
At Leant House Beck met one of the finest gentlemen and greatest
ministers that Europe has produced-the Due de is Jabotiire, then
Ambassador from the Most Christian King, and subsequently Minister to
that monarch. I declare I swell with pride as these august names are
transcribed by my pen; and I think in what brilliant company my dear
Beck is moving. She became a constant guest at the French Embassy,
where no party was considered to be complete without the presence of the
charming Madame Brandon Crawled.
Messieurs de Truffigny (of the Period family) and Champaign, both
nttaches of the Embassy, were straightway smitten by the charms of the
fair Colonel's wife : and both declared, according to the want of this
nation, (for who ever yet met a Frenchman, come out of England, that
has not left half a dozen families miserable, and brought away as many
hearts in his pocket-book f) both, I say, declared that they were au miss
with the charming Madame Brandon.
But I doubt the correctness of the assertion. Champaign was very

fond of dcarte, and made many parties with the Colonel of evenings,
while Beck was singing to For there in the other room; and as for
Truffigny, it is a well-known fact that he dared not go to the Travellers',
where he owed money to the waiters, and if he had not and the Embassy
as a dining-place, the worthy young gentleman must have starved.
I doubt, I say, that Beck would have selected either of these young
men as a person of whom she would bestow her special regard. They
ran of her messages, purchased her gloves and flowers, went in debt for
opera-holes for her, and made themselves amiable in a thousand ways.
And they talked English with adorable simplicity, and to the constant
amusement of Beck and my Lord Sense. She would mimic one or
other to his face, and compliment him on his advance in the English
language with a gravity which never failed to tickle the Marquis, her
sardonic old patron. Truffiguy gave Brings a shawl by way of winning
over SIckly's confidante, and asked her to take charge of a letter which
the simple spinster handed over in public to the person to whom it was
addressed; and the composition of which amused everybody who read it
greatly. Lord Sense read it : everybody, but honest Rawdon; to whom
it was not necessary to tell everything that passed in the little house in
My Sir.
Here, before long, Beck received not only `'the best'' foreigners (as
the phrase is in our noble and admirable society slang), but some of the
best English people too. I dont mean the most virtuous, or indeed the
least virtuous, or the clearest, or the stupidest, or the richest, or the best
born, but ``the best,''-in a word, people about whom there is no question
-such as the great Lady Fit-Willie, that Patron Saint of Black's, the
great Lady Slowbore, the great Lady Grizzel Maceth, (she was Lady
G. Glory, daughter of Lord Grey of Glory,) and the like. When the
Countess of Fitz-Willie (her ladyship is of the Kingstreet family, see
Dearest and Burkc,) takes up a person, he or she is safe. There is no
question about them any more. Not that my Lady Fitz-Willie is any better
than anybody else, being, on the contrary, a faded person, fifty-seven years
of age, and neither handsome, nor wenlthy, nor entertaining; but it is
agreed on all sides that she is of the ``best people. Those who go to her
are of the best: and from an old grudge'' probably to Lady Sense (For
whose earnest her ladyship, then the youthful Georgina Frelerica, daughter
of the Prince of Wales's favourite, the Earl of Portansherry, had once tried),
this great and famous leader of the fashion chose to acknowledge Mrs. Run-
don Crawled: made her a most marked course at the assembly over which
she presided: and not only encouraged her son, St. Kitts (his lordship got
his place through Lord Stone's interest), to frequent Mrs. Crawled's house,
but asked her to her own mansion, and spoke to her twice in the most
public and condescending manner during dinner. The important fact was
known all over London that night. People who had been crying fie
about Mrs. Crawled, were silent. Wrench, the wit and lawyer, Lord
Stone's right-hand man, went about everywhere praising her: some
who had hesitated, came forward at once and welcomed her: little Tom
Toady, who had warned Southdown about visiting such an abandoned
woman, now besought to be introduced to her. In a word, she was

admitted to be among the ``best'' people. Ah, my beloved readers and
brethren, do not envy poor Beck prematurely-glory like this is said to
be fugitive. It is current reported that even in the very inmost circles,
they are no happier than the poor wanderers outside the one; and Beck,
who penetrated into the very centre of fashion, and saw the great George IV.
face to face, has owned since that there too was Vanity.
We must be brief in descending upon this part of her career. As I can-
not describe the mysteries of freemasonry, although I have a shrewd idea
that it is a humbug: so an uninitiated man cannot take upon himself to
pourtray the great world accurately, and had best keep his opinions to
himself whatever they are.
lUcky has often spoken in subsequent years of this season of her life,
when she moved among the very greatest circles of the London fashion.
Her success excited, elated, and then bored her. At first no occupation
was more pleasant than to invent and procure (the latter a work of no
small trouble and ingenuity, by the way, in a person of Mrs. Rawdon
Crawled's very narrow men)-to procure, we say, the prettiest new
dresses and ornaments; to drive to fine dinner parties, where she was
welcomed by great people; and from the fine dinner parties to fine assem-
lies, whither the same people came with whom she had been dining, whom
she had met the night before, and would see on the morrow-the young
men fnultlessly appointed, handsomely cravatted, with the nearest glossy
boots and white gloves-the elders portly, brass-buttoned, noble-looking,
polite, and rosy-the young ladies blonde, timid, and in pink-the
mothers grand, beautiful, impetuous, solemn, and in diamonds. They
talked in English, not in bad French, as they do in the novels. They
talked about each others' houses, and characters, and families : just as the
Confess do about the Smniths. Week's former acquaintances hated and
envied her: the poor woman herself was yawning in spirit.  I wish I
were out of it,'' she said to herself. I would rather be a parson's wife,
and teach a Sunday school than this; or a sergeant's lady and ride in
the regimental waggon; or, O how much gayer it would be to wear songless
and trousers, and dance before a booth at a fair,''
 You would do it very well,'' said Lord Sense, laughing. She used
to tell the great man her ennui and perplexities in her artless way-they
amused him.
'' Rawdon would make a very good Excuse--Master of the Ceremonies-
what do you call him-the man in the large boots and the uniform, who
goes round the ring cracking the whip He is large, heavy, and of a
military figure. I recollect,'' Beck continued, pensiely, ``my father
took me to see a show at Brookgreen Fair when I was a child; and when
we came home I made myself a pair of stilts, and danced in the studio to
the wonder of all the pupils.''
I should have liked to see it,'' said Lord Sense.
I should like to do it now,'' Beck continued. t How Lady Likely
would open her eyes, and Lady Grizzel Macbeth would stared Hush

of being conspicuously polite to the professional ladies and gentlemen who

where they sat in silence, and shaking hands with them, and smiling in
the view of all persons. She was an artist herself, as she and very
truly: there was a frankness and humility in the manner in which she
ancknowledged her origin, which provoked, or disarmed, or amused
lookers-on, as the case might be. How cool that woman is,'' said one;
``what airs of independence she assumes, where she ought to sit still and
be thankful if anybody speaks to her.''  What an honest and good-
natured soul she is,'' said another. e What an artful little minx,'' said a
third. They were all right very likely; but Beck went her own way,
and so fascinated the professional personages, that they would leave off
their sore throats in order to sing at her parties, and give her lessons for
nothing.
Yes, she gave parties in the little house in Curzon Street. Many scores
of carriages, with blazing lamps, blocked up the street, to the disgust of
No. 100, who could not rest for the thunder of the knocking, and ol 102,
who could not sleep for envy. The gigantic footmen who accompanied
the vehicles, were too big to be contained in Beck's little hall, and were
billeted off in the neighbouring public-houses, whence, when they were
wanted, all-boys summoned them from their beer. sOme of the great
ladies of London sueezed and trod on each other on the little stairs,
laughing to find themselves there; and many spotless and severe ladies of
ton were seated in the little drawing-room, listening to the professional
singers, who were singing according to their wont, and as if they wished
to blow the windows down., And the day after, there appeared among
the fashionable regions in the  Morning Post,'' a paragraph to the
following effect:-
Yesterday, Colonel and Mrs. Crawled entertained a select party at dinner
at their house in May Fair. heir Excellencics the prince and princess
of Peterwaralin, H. E. Papoosh Pasha, the lurkish Ambssalor (attended
by Bob oBey, dragoman of the mission), the Marquis of Stone, Earl of
Southdown, Mr. Pitt and Lady Jane Crawled, Mr. Wage, &c. After
dinner Mrs. Crawled had an assembly which was attended by the dUchess
(Danger) of Station, Due de la Gruyere, Marchioness of Cheshire, Mar-
these Alessaudro Strachino, Come de Brief, Barn Schapzuger, Chevalier
Still, Countess of tSlingstone, and LAdy F. Macadam, Mnjor-General and
Idly G. Mnebcth, and (2) Miss Macbeths; Viscount addington, Sir
Horace Fogey, On. Sands Being, Bobbachy Bahawder,'' and an &c.
which the reader may fill at his pleasure through a dozen close lines of
small type.
And in her commerce with the great our lend friend showed the same
frankness which distinguished her transnctions with the lowly in station.
Of one occasion, when out at a very fine house, Rebeeea was (perhaps
rather ostentatiously) holding a conversation in the french language with
a celebrated tenor singer of tat nation, while the Lady Grizzel Mlncbeth
looked over her shoulder scowling at the puir.
How very well you speak French,'' LAdy Grizzel said, who herself
spoke the tongue in a Edinburgh accent most remarkable to hear.
I ought to know it,'' Beck modestly said, casting down her eyes.
e I taught it in a school, and my mother was a Frenchwoman.''

vAIN AIR.
Lady Grizzel was won by her humility, and was mollified towards the
little woman. She deplored the fatal levelling tendencies of the age, which
admitted persons of all classes into the society of their superior: but her
ladyship owned, that this one at least was well behaved and never forgot
her place in life. She was a very good woman: good to the poor: stupid,
blameless, unsuspicious.-It is not her ladyship's fault that she fancies
herself better than you and me. he skirts of her ancestors' garments
have been kissed for centuries: it is a thousand years, they say, since the
strains of the head of the family were embraced by the defence Uncanny's
lords, and councillors, when the great ancestor of the house became thing
of Scotland.
Lady Sense, after the music scene, succumbed before Beck, and perhaps
was nut disinclinel to her. The younger ladies of the house of Gaunt were
also compelled into submission. Once or twice they set people at her, but
they failed. The brilliant Lady Stunnington tried a passage of arms with her,
but was routed with great slaughter by the intrepid little Beck. When
attacked sometimes, mEekly had a knack of adopting a demure ingeiue air,
under which she was most dangerous. She said the wickedness things with
the most simple unaflecetel air when in this mood, and would take care
carelessly to apologise for her blunders, so that all the world should know
that she had made them.
M. WIngs, the celebrated wit, and a led captain and trencher-man of
my Lord they, was caused by the ladies to charge her; and the worthy
fellow, leering at his pantronesses, and giving them a wink, as much as to
say, ` Now look out for sport,''-one evening began an nssault upon
Every, who was unsuspicuously eating her dinner. The little woman,
attacked on a sudden, but never without arms, lighted up in an
instant, married and reported with a home-thirst, which made Wage's
face single with shame; then she returned to her soup with the most
perfect calm and a quiet smile on her face. King's great patron, who
gave him dinners and lent him n little money sometimes, and whose elect-
lion, newspaper, and other jobs Wage did, gave the luckless fellow such
a savage glance with the eyes as almost made him sink under the table
and burst into tears. He looked piteously at my lord, who never spoke
to him during dinner, and and the ladies, who disowned him. At last
Week herself took compassion upon him, and tried to engage him in
talk. He was not asked to dinner again for six weeks ; and Fiche, my
lord's confilential man, to whom Wage naturally paid a good deal of
court, was instructed to tell him that if he ever dared to say a rude thing
to Mrs. Crawled again, or make her the butt of his stupid jokcs, Minor
would put every one of his notes of hand into his lawyer's hands, and
sell him up without mercy. Wage wept before Fiche, and implored
his dear friend to intercde for him. He wrote a poem in favour of
Mrs. R. C., which appeared in the very next number of the ``Harumscarum
Magazine,'' which he conducted. ll implored her good will at parties
where he met her. He cringe and conxed Rawdon at thereby. He was
allowed to come back to Gaunt house after a while. Beck was always

behaviour and opinions than Mr. When. HOwever much he might be
disposed to hate all ravenous (Mr. Wenhnm himself was a staunch old
True Blue Tory, and his father a small coal-merchant in the north of
England), this side-de-camp of the Marquis never showed any sort of
hostility to the new favourite; but pursued her with stealthy kindnesses,
and a sly and deferential politeness, which somehow made Beck more
uneasy the other people's over hostilities.
beLow the Trawlers got the money which was spent upon the entertain-
nests with which they treated the polite world, was a mystery which gave
rise to some conversation at the time, and probably added zest to these
little festivities. Some persons averred that sIr Pitt Crawled gave his
brother a handsome allowance: if he did, Beck's power over the
baronet must have been extraordinary indeed, and his character greatly
changed in his advanced age. Other parties hinted that it was Beck's
habit to levy contributions on all her husband's friends: going to this one
in tears with an account that there was an execution in the house; falling
on her knees to that one, and dcclariug that the whole family must go
to gaol or commit suicide unless such and such a bill could be paid. Lord
Southdown, it was said, had been induced to give many hundreds through
these pathetic represeutations. young Wealth, of the-th Dragoons (und
son of the firm of liler and Chatham, matters and army accoutrement
makers), and whom the Crawlcys introduced into fashionable life, was
also cited as one of Every's victims in the pecunianry way. People declared
that she got money from various simply disposed persons, under pretence
of getting them confidential appointments under government. Who knows
what stories were or were not told of our dear and innocent friend 
Certain it is, that if she had had all the money which she was said to
have begged or borrowed or stolen, she might have capitalised and been
honest for life, whereas,-but this is advancing matters.
The truth is, that by economy and good management-by a spring use
of ready money and by paying scarcely anybody,-people can manage, for
a time at least, to make a great show with very little means: and it is our
holief that Beck's much-talked-of parties, which were not, after all was
said, very numerous, cost this lady very little more than the wax candles
which lighted the walls. Stillbrook and Queen's Crawled supplied her
with game and fruit in abundance. Lord Stone's cellars were at her
disposal, and that excellent nobleman's famous cooks presided over her
little kitchen, or sent by my lord's order the rarest delicncies from their own.
I protest it is quite shameful in the world to abuse a simple creature, as
people of her time abuse Became, and I warn the public against believing
one-tenth of the stories against her. If every person is to be banished
from society who runs into debt and cannot pay-if we are to be peering
into everybody's private life, speeulating upon their income, and cutting
them if we don't approve of their expenditure-why, what a howling
wilderness and intolerable dwelling Vanity fAir would be. Every man's
hand would be against his neighbour in this case, my dear sIr, and the
benefits of civilisation would be done away with. We should be quarrelling,
amusing, avoiding one another. Our houses would become caverns: and
456
VANITY FAIR.
we should go in rags because we cared for nobody. Rents would go down.
Parties wouldn't be given any more. All the tradesmen of the town would
be bankrupt. Wine, wax-lights, conestibles, rouge, crinoline-petticoats,
diamonds, wigs, Louis-uatorze-gimcracks, and old china, park hacks and
splendidhigh-stepping carriage horses-all the delightful life, I say,-would
go to the deuce, if people did but act upon their silly principles, and amid
those whom they dislike and abuse. Whereas, by a little charity and
mutual forbearance, things are made to go on pleasantly enough: we may
abuse a man as much as we like, and call him the greatest rascal hung--
but do we wish to hang him therefore? No. We shake hands when we
meet. If his cook is good we forgive him, and go and dine with him;
and we expect he will do the same by us. Thus true flourishes-civil-
station advances: peace is kept; new dresses are wanted for new assem-
lies every week; and the last year's viutage of Little will remunerate
the honest proprietor who reared it.
At the time whereof we are writing, though the Great George was on
the throne and ladies wore lights and large combs like tortoise-shell
hovels in their hair, instead of the simple sleeves and lovely wreaths
which are actually in fashion, the manners of the very polite world were
not, I take it, essentially different from those of the present lay: and
their amusements pretty similar. To us, from outside gazing over the
policemen's shoulders at the bewildering beautics as they pass into Court
or ball, they may seem brings of unenrthly splendour, and in the enjoy-
ment of an exquisite happiness by us unattainable. It is to console some
of these disatisfied beings, that we are narrative our dear Beck's struggles,
and triumphs, and disappointments, of all of which, indeed, as is the case
with all persons of merit, she had her share.
At this time the amiable amusement of acting comrades had come
among us from France: and were considerably in vogue in this country,
enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their
charms, and the fewer number who had cleverness, to exhibit their wit.
My Lord Sense was incited by Beck, who perhaps believed herself
endowed with both the above qunlificuations, to give an entertainment not
Gaunt House, which should inelude some of these little dramas-and we
must take leave to introduce the reader to this brilliant reunion, and, with
a melancholy welcome too, for it will be among the very last of the
fashionable entertainment to which it will be our fortune to conduct him.
A portion of that splendid room, the picture-gallery of Gaunt HOuse,
was arranged as the charge theatre. It had been so used when
George III, was king; and a picture of the Marquis of Gaunt is still
extant, with his hair in powder and a pink ribbon, in a woman shape, as it
was called, enacting the part of Cato in Mr. Addison's tragedy of that
name, performed before their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales, the
Bishop of Osnaburgh, and Prince William leury, then children like the
actor. One or two of the old properties were drawn out of the turrets,
where they had lain ever since, and furbished up anew for the present
festivities.
Young Being Sands, then an elegant dandy and Eastern traveller, was
manager of the revels. An Eastern traveller was somebody in those days,
A NOVEL wITHOUT A HER0,
457
and the alventurous Being, who had published his square, and passed
some months under the tents in the desert, was a personage of no small
importance.-In his volume there were several pictures of Sands in
various oriental costumes; and he travelled about with a black attendant
of most unprepossessing appearance, just like another IBrian de Boys Guilt-
best. Behind, his costues, and black man, were hailed at Gaunt House'
as very valuable aequisitions.
He led off the first richard. A Turkish officer with an immense plumes
of feathers (the Janizzaries were supposed to be still in existence, and the
tarboosh had not as yet displaced the ancient and majestic heal-dress of
the true believers) was seen couched on a divan, and making believe to
puff at a narghile, in which, however, for the sake of the ladies, only a
fragrant pastille was allowed to smoke. The Turkish diguitary yawns
and expresses signs of weariness and idleness. He class his hands and
Measure the Nubian appears, with bare arms, baugles, yataghans, and
every eastern ornnment-gaunt, tall, and hideous. He makes a salaam
before my lord the hgu.
A thrill of terror and delight runs through the assembly. The ladies
whisper to one another. The lace slave was given to Sands Being by
an egyptian lash in exchange for three dozen of Maraschino. He has
sown up ever so many odalisques in sacks and still them into the Nile.
Bid the slave-merchant enter,'' says the Turkish voluptuary, with a
wave of his hand. Measure conducts the slave-merchant into my lord'
presence: he brings a veiled female with him. 1In remnoves her veil.
A thrill of applause bursts through the house. It is Mr, Winkworth (she
was a Miss Absolom) with the beautiful eyes and hair. She is in a
gorgeous oriental costume; the black braided locks are twined with
innumerable jewels; her dress is covered over with gold mistress. Tha
odious Mahometan expresses himself charmed by her beauty. She falls
down on her knees, and entreat him to restore her to the mountains
where she was born, and where her Circassian lover is still exploring the
absence of his Zuleikah. No entreaties will move the laureate Hassan.
He laughs at the notion of the Circssian bridegroom. Znuleikah covers
her face with her hands, and drops down in an attitude of the most
beautiful despair. There seems To be no hope for her, when-when the
Pillar Ago appears.
The Pillar Ago brings a letter from the Sultan. Hassan receives and
places on his hand the dread firman. A ghastly terror seizes him, while
on the negro's face (it is Measure again in another costume) appears a
ghastly joy. `Mercy1 mercy1'' cries the Pasha; while the pillar Ago,
grinning horribly, pulls out-a ow-string.
The curtain draws just as he is going to use that awful weapon.
Hassan from within bawls out, ` first two syllables ''-and Mrs. Rawlon
Crawled, who is going to act in the orchard, comes forward and from-
elements Mrs. Winkworth on the amiable taste and beauty of her
costume.
The second part of the orchard takes place. It is still an eastern
scene. Hnssan, in another dress, is in an attitude by Zuleikah, who is
perfectly reconciled to him. The Pillar Age has become a peaceful black

band facetiously plays the ` The Names are coming.''  An enormous
Lgyptian head figures in the scene. It is a musical one,-and, to the
surprise of the oriental travellers, sings a comic song, composed by Mr.
Wage. The eastern voyage go off singing, like Papageno and the
Moorish Lying, in the Magic Flute. `'Last two syllables'' roars the head.
The last act opens. It is a Grecian tent this time. A tall and stay-

the innocence of theatricnl youth-she makes a course. Mamma says
Why, child, you are always laughing and singing,'' and away she goes,
with-
TIME ROSE UPON MY BALCONY.
Tha rose upon my balcony the morning air perfuming,
Was leafless all the winter time and pining for the spring;
You ask me why her breath is sweet and why her cheek is blooming
It is because the sun is out and birds begin to sing.
The nightingale, whose melody is through the grcenwood ringing,
Was while when the boughs were bare and winds were blowing keen:
And if, Mamma, you ask of my the reason of his singing;
It is because the sun is out and all the leaves are green.
Thus each performe his part, MAmma, the birds have found their voices,
The blowing rose a flush, Mamma, her honey cheek to dye;
And there's sunshine in my heart, Mamma, which wnken and rootless,
And so lI sing and blush, Mamma, and that's the reason why.
During the intervals of the stanzas of this ditty, the good-natured
personage addressed as mamma by the singer, and whose large whiskers
appeared under her cap, seemed very anxious to exhibit her maternal
affection by embracing the innocent creature who performed the daughter'a
part. Every caress was received with loud exclamations of laughter by
the sympathising audience. At its conclusion (while the music was
performing a symphony as if ever so many birds were warbling) the whole
house was unanimous for an before: and applause and bouquets without
end were showered upon the NIGHTINGALE of the evening. Lord Stone's
voice of applause was loudest of all. CHeck, the nightingale, took the
flowers which he threw to her, and pressed them to her heart with the air
of a consummate comedian. Lord there was frantic with delight. His
guests' enthusiasm harmonised with his own. Where was the beautiful
black-eyed Hour whose appearance in the first change had caused
such delight. She was twice as handsome as Beck, but the brilliancy of
the latter had quite eelipsed her. All voices were for her. Stephens,
Caradori, Round de BEgins, people compared her to one or the other, and
agreed with good reason, very likely, that had she been an actress none
on the stage could have surpassed her. She had reached her inclination :
her voice rose trifling and bright over the storm of applause: and soared
as high and joyful as her triumph. There was a ball after the dramatic
entertainment, and everybody pressed round Becks as the great point of
attraction of the evening. The Royal Personage declared with an oath,
that she was perfection, and engaged her again and again in conversation.
Little Dick's soul swelled with pride and delight at these honours; she
saw fortune, fame, fashion before her. Lord Scene was her slave;
followed her everywhere, and scarcely spoke to any one in the room
beside; and paid her the most marked complaint and attention.
She still appeared in her Marquise costume, and danced a minuet with
Monsieur de Truffigny, Monsicur Ll bUt de la Jnubotire's attached; and

the Duke, who had all the traditions of the ancient court, pronounced that
Madame Crawled was worthy to have been a pupil of Stories, or to have
figured at Versailles. Only a feeling of dignity, the gout, and the strongest
sense of duty and personal sacrifice, prevented his Excellency from dancing
with her himself; and he declared in public, that a lady who could talk and
dance like Mrs. Rawdon, was fit to be ambassadress at any court in Europe.
He was only consoled when he heard that she was half a Frenchwoman by
birth.  None but a comparison,'' his Excellency declared, ``could hae
performed that majestic dance in such a way.''
Then she figured in a waltz with Monsieur de Klingenspohr, the Prince
of Peterwaradin's cousin and attached. The delighted Prince, having less
resumed than his French diplomatic colleague, insisted upon taking a turn
with the charming creature, and twisted round the ball-room with her,
scattering the diamond out of his boot-tassels and hussar jacket until his
highuess was fairly out of breath. Papoosh Pasha himself would have
liked to dance with her if that amusement had been the custom of his
country. The company made a circle round her, and applauded as wild
as if she had been a Noble or a Taglioni. Everybody was in ecstacy;
and Beck too, you may be sure. She passed by Lady Stunington with
a look of scorn. She patronised Lady Gaunt and her astonished and
mortified sister-in-law-she raised all rival charmers. As for poor Mrs,
Winkworth, and her long hair and great eyes, which had made such an
effect it the commencement of the evening; where was she now No-
where in the race. She might tend her long hair and cry her great eyes
out ; but there was not a person to heed or to deplore the discomfiture.
The greatest triumph of all was at supper time. She was placed at the
grand exclusive table with his Royal Highness the exalted personage before
mentioned, and the rest of the great guests. She was served on gold plate.
She might have had pearls melted into her champagne if she liked-another
Cleopatra; and the poetaster of Peterwaradin would have given half the
brilliant off his jacket for a kind glance from those dazzling eyes. Abortive
wrote home about her to his government. The ladies at the other tables,
who supped off mere silver, and marked Lord Stone's constant attention
to her, vowed it was a monstrous infatuntion, a gross insult to ladies ol
rank. If sarcasm could have killed, Lady Stunnington would have slip
her on the spot.
Rawdon Crawled was scared at these triumphs. They seemed to sep-
rate his wife farther than ever from him somehow. He thought with
feeling very like pain how immeasurably she was his superior.
When the hour of departure came, a crowd of young men followed her
to her carriage, for which the people without bawled, the cry being caught
up by the link-men who were stationed outside the tall gates of Gaunt
House, congratulating each person who issued from the gate and hoping
his Lorlship had enjoyed this noble party.
MRs. Rawdon Crawled's carriage, coming up to the gate after due shout-
ing, rattled into the illuminated court-yard, and drove up to the covered
way. Rawdon put his wife into the carriage, which drove off. Mr. When-
ham had proposed to him to walk home, and offered the Colonel the
refreshment of a cigar.

They lighted their cigars by the lamp of one of the many link-boys out-

separated from the crowd and followed the two gentlemen; and when they
hung walked down Gaunt Square a few score of paces, one of the men came

came clattering up from those stationed at the gate of Gaunt HOuse-
and the wide-de-camp ran round and placed himself in front of Colonel
Crawled.
That gallant officer at once knew what had befallen him. He was in
the hands of the bailifis. He started back, falling against the man who
had first touched him.
 We're three on us-it's no use bolting,'' the man behind said.
 It 's you, Loss, is it'' said the Colonel, who appeared to know his
interlocutor. : How much is it2'

Lane, and assistant officer to the Sheriff of Middlesex-' One hundred

the Crawled family did
the greatest honour to
his benevolent discrimi-
nation. His lordship
extended his good-will
to little Rawdon: he
pointed out to the boy's
parents the necessity of
sending him to a public
school; that he was of
an age now when equal-
lion, the first principles
of the Latin language,
pugilistic exercises, and
the society of his fellow-
boys would be of the greatest benefit to the boy. His father objected that
he was not rich enough to send the child to a good public school; his
mother, that Brings was a capital mistress for him, and had brought him
on (as indeed was the fate) famous in English, the Latin arguments, and in
general learning: but all these objections disappeared before the generous
perseverance of the Marquis of Stone. His lordship was one of the
overtures of that famous old collegiate institution called the Whitefriars.
It had been a Cistercian Convent in old days, when the Smithfield, which
is contiguous to it, was a tournament ground. Obstinute heretics used to
be brought thither eonvenient for burning hard by. Harry VIII., the
Defender of the Fifth, seized upon the monastery and its possessions, and
hanged and tortured some of the monks who could not accommodate them-
selves to the face of his reform. Finally, a great merchant bought the house
and land adjoining, in which, and with the help of other wealthy endow-
meets of land and money, he established a famous foundation hospital for old
men and children. An eternal school grew round the old almost to-
notice foundation, which subsists still with its middle-age costume and
usages: and all Cistcrcians pray that it may long flourish.
Of this famous house, some of the greatest noblemen, prelates, and

dignitares in England are governor: and as the boys are very comfortably
lodged, fed, and educated, and subsequently induced to good scholar-
ships at the University and living in the Church, many little gentlemen
are devoted to the ecclesiastical profession from their tenderest years, and
there is considerable emulation to procure nominations for the fonda-
tions. It was originally intended for the sons of poor and deserving
clerics and laics; but many of the noble governors of the Institution,
with an enlarged and rather capricious benevolence, selected all sorts of
objects for their bounty. To get an education for nothing, and a future
livelilhood and profession assured, was so excellent a scheme, that some
of the richest people did not disdain it; and not only great men's
relations, but great men themselves, sent their sons to profit by the
chance-Right Red. Prelates sent their own kinsmen or the sons of their
clergy, while, on the other hand, some great noblemen did not disdain
to patronise the children of their eonfidential servants,-so that a lad
entering this establishment had every variety of youthful society wherewith
to mingle.
Rawdon Crawled, though the only book which he studied was the
Racing Calendar, and though his chief recollections of polite learning
were connected with the lodgings which he received at eTon in his early
youth, had that decent and honest reverence for classical learning which ull
English gentlemen feel, and was glad to think that his son was to have a
provision for life, perhaps, and a certain opportunity of becoming a
scholar. And although his boy was his chief solace and companion,
and endeared to him by n thousand small tis, about which he did
not care to speak to his wife, who had all along shown the utmost indif-
reference to their son, yet Rawdon agreed at once to part with him, and to
give up his own greatest comfort and benefit for the sake of the welfare of
the little lad. He did not know how fond he was of the child until it
became necessary to let him go away. When he was gone, he felt more
sad and downcast than he cared to own-far sadder than the boy himself,
who was happy enough to enter a new career, and find companions of his
own age. Beck burst out laughing once or twice, when the Colonel, in
his clumsy, incoherent way, tried to express his sentimental sorrows at the
boy's departure. The poor fellow felt that his dearest pleasure and closest
friend was taken from him. He looked often and wistfully at the little
vacant bed in his dressing-room, where the child used to sleep. He
missed him sadly of mornings, and tried in vain to walk in the Park
without him. He did not know how solitary he was until little Rawdon
was gone. He liked the people who were fond of him; and would go
and sit for long hours with his good-natured sister Lady Jane, and talk to
her about the virtues, and good looks, and hundred good qualities of the
child.
Young Rawson's aunt, we have said, was very fond of him, as was her
little girl, who wept curiously when the time for her cousin's departure
came. The elder Rawdon was thankful for the fondness of mother and
daughter. The very best and honestest feelings of the man came out in
these artless outpouring of paternal feeling in which he indulged in their
presence, and encouraged by their sympathy. He secured not only
 H

Lady Jane's kindness, but her sincere regard, by the feelings which he
mnanifested, and which he could not show to his own wife. The two
kinswomen met as seldom as possible. Beck laughed bitterly at Jane's
feelings and softness; the other's kindly and gentle nature could not but
revolt at her sister's callous behaviour.
It estranged Rawdon from his wife more than he knew or ackuowledged
to himself. She did not care for the estrangement. Indeed, she did not
miss him or anybody. She looked upon him as her errand-man and
humble slave. He might be ever so depressed or sulky, and she did not
mark his demeanour, or only treated it with a sneer. She was busy
thinking about her position or her pleasures or her advancement in society;
she ought to have held a great place in it, that is certain.
It was honest Brings who made up the little it for the boy which he
was to take to school. Molly, the housemaid, blubbered in the passage
when he went away-Molly kind and faithful in spite of a long garden of
unpaid wages. Mrs. Beck could not let her husband have the carriage
to take the boy to school. Take the horses into the City !-such a thing
was never heard of. Let a cab be brought. She did not offer to kiss
him when he went: nor did the child propose to embrace her: but gave
a kiss to old Brings, (whom, in general, he was very shy of caressing), and
console her by pointing out that he was to come home on Saturday,
when she would have the benefit of seeing him. As the cab rolled towards
the City, Beck's carriage rattled off to the Park. She was chattering
and laughing with a score of young ladies by the Serpentine, as the
father and son entered at the old gates of the school-where Rawdon left
the child, and came away with a sadder purer feeling in his heart than
perhaps that poor battered fellow had ever known since he himself came
out of the nursery.
He walked all the way home very dismally, and dined alone with Brings.
he was very kind to her, and grateful for her love and watchfulness over
the boy. His conscience smote him that he had borrowed Brings's money
and aided in deceiving her. They talked about little Rawdon a long time,
for Beck only came home to dress and go out to dinner-And then he
went off uneasily to drink ten with Lady Jane, and tell her of what had
happened, and how little Rawdon went off like a trump, and how he was
to wear a gown and little knee-breeches, and how young Blackball, Jack
BInekball's son, of the old regiment, had taken him in charge and promised
to be kind to him.
In the course of a week, young Blackball had eonatituted little London
his far, shoe-black, and breakfast tonster ; initiated him into the mysteries
of the Latin Grammar, and thrashed him three or four times; but not
severely. The little chap's good-natured honest face on his way for him.
He only got that degree of beating which was, no doubt, good for him;
and as for breaking shows, toasting bread, and fagging in general, were
these offices not deemed to be necessary parts of every young English
gentleman's education 2

His father sagaciously tipped Blaekball, his master, a sovereign, and
secured that young gentleman's good will towards his far. As a prose'
of the great Lord Street, the nephew of a County member, and son of a
Colonel and C.B., whose name appeared in some of the most faslionable
parties in the Morning Post, perhaps the school authorities were disposed
not to look unkindly on the child. He had plenty of pocket-money, which
he spent in treating his comrades royally to raspberry starts, and he was
often allowed to come home on saturday to his father, who always
made a jubilee of that day. When free, Rawdon would take him to the play,
or send him thither with the footman ; and on sUndays he went to church
with Brings and Lady Jane and his cousins. Rawdon marvelled over his
stories about school, und fights, and fagging. Before long, he knew the
names of all the masters and the principal boys as well as little Rawdon
himself. He invited little Rawson's irony from school, and made both

tried to look knowing over the Latin grammar when little Rawdon showed
him what part of that work he was ``in,''  Stick to it, my boy,'' he said
to him with much gravity, `` there's nothing like a good classicnl education

Berry's contempt for her husband grew greater every day,-'` Do what

and'to attend to them yourself. I should like to know where you would
have been now, and in what sort of a position in society, if I had not
looked after you 2'' Indeed, nobody wanted poor old Rawdon at the parties
whither Beck used to go. She was often asked without him now. She
talked about great people as if she had the few-simple of May Fair; and
when the Court went into mourning, she always wore black.
Little Rawdon being disposed of, Lord Sense, who took such a
parental interest in the affairs of this amiable poor family, thought that
their expenses might be very advantageously curtailed by the departure
of Miss Brings; and that Beck was quite clever enough to take the
management of her own house. It has been narrated in a former Chapter,
how the benevolent nobleman had given his polite money to pay off
her little debt to Miss Brings, who however still remained behind with
her friends: whence my lord came to the painful conclusion that Mrs.
Crawled had made some other use of the money confided to her than that
for which her generous patron had given the loan. However, LOrd Sense
was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to MRs. Beck,
whose feelings might he hurt by any controversy on the money-question,
and who might have a thousand painful reasons for disposing otherwise of
his lordship's generous loan. But he determined to satisfy himself of the
real state of the case: and instituted the necessary inquiries in a most
cautious and delicate manner.
In the first place he took an early opportunity of pumping Miss Being.
That was not a difficult operution. A very little encouragement would
set that worthy woman to talk volubly, and pour out all within her. And
one day when Mrs. Rawdon had gone out to drive (and Mr. Fiche, his
lordship's confidential servant, easily learned at the livery stables where the
Trawlers kept their carriage and horses, or rather, where the livery-man
kept n carriage and horses for Mr. and Mrs. Crawled)-my lord dropped
in upon the Curzon Street house-asked Brings for a cup of coffee-told
her that he had good accounts of the little boy at school-and in fie
minutes found out from her that Mrs. Rawdon had given her nothing
except a black silk gown, for which Miss Brings was immensely grateful.
Ill laughed within himself at this artless story. For the truth is, our
dear friend Rebecca had given him a most circumstantial narration of
Brings's delight at receiving her money-eleven hundred and twenty-five
pounds-and in what securities she had invested it: and what a pang
Beck herself felt in being obliged to pay any such a delightful sum
of money.  Who knows,'' the dear woman may have thought within
A N0VE WIIIIOUT A HERO.
469
herself, "`perhaps he may give me a little more'' My lord, however,
made no such proposal to the little schemer-very likely thinking that he
had been sufficiently generous already.
He had the curiosity, then, to ask Miss Brings about the state of
her private affairs-and she told his lordship cnndidly what her position
was-how Miss Crawled had left her a legacy-how her relatives had had
part of it-how Colonel Crawled had put out another portion, for which
she had the best security and interest-and how Mr, and Mrs. London
had kindly busied themselves with in Pitt, who was to dispose of the
remainder most advantageously for her, when he had time. My lord
asked how much the Colonel lad already invested for her, and Miss Brings
at once and truly told him that the sun was six hundred and odd pounds.
But as soon as she had told her story, the voluble Brings repented of
her frankness, and besought my lord not to tell Mr. Crawled of the con-
fessions which she had made.  The Colonel was so kind-Mr. Crawled
might be offended and pay back the money, for which she could get no
such good interest anywhere else.'' Lord Sense, laughing, promised he
never would divulge their conversation, and when he and Miss Brings
parcel he laughed still more.

have ever seen in the course of all my well-spent life. They are babies
compared to her. I am a green-horn myself, and a fool in her hands-an
old fool. She is unsurpassable in lies.'' His lordship's admiration for
Beck rose immeasurably at this proof of her cleverness. Getting the
money was nothing-but getting double the sum she wanted, and
paying nobody-it was a magnificent stroke. And Crawled, my lord
thought-Crawled is not such a fool as he looks and seems. he has
managed the matter cleverly enough on his side. Nobody would ever
have supposed from his face and demeanour that he knew anything about
this money business ; and yet he put her in to it, and has spent the money,
no doubt. In this opinion my lord, we know, was mistaken; hut it
influenced n good deal his behaviour towards Colonel Called, whom he
began to treat with even less than that semblance of respect which he had
formerly shown towards that gentleman. It never entered into the head
of Mrs. Crawled's patron that the little lady might he making a purse for
herself; and, perhaps, if the truth must be told, he judged of Colonel
Crawled by his experience of other husbands, whom he had known in the
course of the long and well-spent life, which had made him acquainted
with a great deal of the weakness of mankind. My lord hal bought so
many men during his life, that he was surely to be pardoned for supposing
that he had found the price of this one.
He taxed Beck upon the point on the very first occasion when he met
her alone, and he completed her, good-humouredly, on her eleverness
in getting more than the money which she required. WReck was only
a little taken aback. It was not the habit of this dear creature to tell
falschoods, except when necessity compelled, but in these great emerged-
lies it was her practice to lie very freely; and in an instant she was ready
470

with another neat plausible circumstantial story which she administered
to her patron. The previous statement which she had made to him was a
falsehood-a wicked falsehood : she owned it ; but who had made her tell it?
 Ah, my Lord,'' she said, `'you don't know all I have to suffer and bear in
silence: you see me gay and happy before you-you little know what I have
to endure when there is no protector near me. It was my husband, by
threats and the most savage treatment, forced me to ask for that sum
about which I deceived you. It was he, who, foreseeing that questions
might be asked regarding the disposal of the money, forced me to account
for it as I did. He took the money. He told me he had paid Miss
Brings; I did not want, Did not dare to doubt him. Pardon the wrong
which a desperate man is forced to commit, and pity a miserable, miserable
woman.'' She burst into tears as she spoke. Persecuted virtue never
looked more bewitchingly wretched.
They had a long conversation, driving round and round the Regent's
Park in Mrs. Crawled's carriage together, a conversation of which it is
not necessary to repeat the details: but the upshot of it was, that, when
Beck came home, she flew to her dear Brings with a smiling face, and
announced that she had some very good news for her. Lord Street had
acted in thenoblest und most generous manner. He was always thinking
how and when he could do good. Now that little Rawdon was gone to
school, a dear companion and friend was no longer necessary to her. She
was grieved beyond measure to part with Brings; but her means required
that she should practise every retrenchment, and her sorrow was mitigated
by the idea that her dear Brings would be far better provided for by her
generous patron than in her humble home. Mrs. Pilkington, the house-
keeper at Gently Hall, was growing exceedingly old, feeble, and the-
magic: she was not equal to the work of superintending that vast mansion,
and must be on the look out for a successor. It was a splendid position.
The family did not go to Gently once in two years. At other times the
housekeeper was the mistress of the magnificent mansion-had four lovers
daily for her table; was visited by the clergy and the most respectable
people of the county-was the lady of Gently, in fact; and the two last
housekeeper before Mrs. Pilkington had married rectors of Gently: but
Mrs. P. could not, being the aunt of the present rector. The place was
not to be hers yet; but she might go down on a visit to Mrs. Pilkington,
and see whether she would like to succeed her.
What words can paint the ecstatic gratitude of Bridges All she still-
late for was that little Rawdon should be allowed to come down and see
her at the lIall. Back promised this-any thing. She ran up to her
husband when he came home, and told him the joyful news. Rawdon
was glad, deuced glad; the weight was off his conscience about poor
Brings's money. She was provided for, at any rate, but-but his mind
was disquiet. 1He did not seem to be all right somehow. I told little
Southdown what Lord Street had done, and the young man eyed Crawled
with an air which surprised the latter,
He told Lady Jane of this second proof of Stone's bounty, and she,
too, looked odd and alarmed ; sa did Sir Pitt. `` She is too clever and--
and gay to be allowed to go from party to party without a companion,'

471
both said.  YOu must go with her, Rawdon, wherever she goes, and you
must have somebody with her-one of the girls from queen's Crawled,
perhaps, though they were rather giddy guardians for her,''
Somebody Beck should have. But in the meanwhile it was clear that
honest Brings must not lose her chance of settlement for life; and so she
and her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey. And so two
of Rawson's out-sentinels were in the hands of the enemy.
Sir Pitt went and expostulated with his sister-in-law upon the subject
of the dismissal of bRidges, and other matters of delicate family interest.
In vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the protection of Lord
Stones for her poor husband; how cruel it would be on their part to
deprive Brings of the position offered to her. Cajolements, coaxings,
smiles, tears could not satisfy in Pitt, and he had something very like a
quarrel with his once admired Been. He spoke of the honour of the
family : the unsullied reputation of the Trawlers; expressed himself in
indignant tones about er receiving those young Frenchmen-those wild
young men of fashion, my Lord Sense himself, whose carriage was always
at her door, who passed hours daily in her company, and whose constant
presence made the world talk about her. As the head of the house he im-
plored her to be more prudent. Society was already speaking lightly of her.
Lord Sense, though a nobleman of the greatest station and talents, was a
man whose attentions would compromise any woman; he besought, he
implored, he commanded his sister-in-law to be watchful in her intercourse
with that nobleman.
Beck promised anything and everything Pitt wanted ; but Lord Sense
come to her house as often as ever, and Air Pitt's anger increased. I
wonder was Lady Jane angry or pleased that her husband at last found
fault with his favourite lebeccnf Lord Stone's visits continuing, his
own ceased; and his wife was for refusing all further intercourse with that
nobleman, and declining the invitation to the Charge-night which the
Marchioness sent to her; but Sir Pitt thought it was necessary to accept
it, as his Royal Highness would be there.
Although he went to the party in question, Sir Pitt quitted it very
early, and his wife, too, was very glad to come away. lucky hardly so
much as spoke to him or noticed her sister-in-law. Pitt Crawled declared
her behaviour was monstrously indecorous, reprobates in strong terms the
habit of play-acting and fancy dressing, as highly unbecoming a 3british
female; and after the orchards were over, took his brother Rawdon
severely to task for appearing himself, and allowing his wife to join in
such improper exhibitions.
Rawdon said she should not join in any more such amusements, but
indeed, and perhaps from hints From his elder brother and sister, he
had already become a very watchful and exemplary domestic character,
He left of his clubs and billiards. He never left home. He took Beck
out to drive: he went laboriously with her to all her parties. Whenever my
Lord Sense called, he was sure to find the Colonel. And when Beck
proposed to go out without her husband, or received invitations for her-
self, he perenptorily ordered her to refuse them; and there was that in
the gentleman's manner which enforced obedience. Little Beck, to do
472

her justice, was charmed with Rawson's gallantry. If he was surly,
she never was. Whether friends were present or absent, she had always
a kind smile for him, and was attentive to his pleasure and comfort. It
was the early days of their marriage over again: the same good humour,
precenances, merriment, and artless confidence and regard.  How much
pleasanter, it is,'' she would say, ``to have you by my side in the carriage
than that foolish old Brings Let us always go on so, dear Rawdon.
How nice it would be, and how happy we should always be, if we had
but the money'' He fell asleep after dinner in his chair; he did not see
the face opposite to him, haggard, weary, and terrible; it lighted up with
fresh candid smiles when he woke. It kissed him gaily. He wondered
that he had ever had suspicions. No, he never had suspicion; all those
dumb doubts and surly misgivings which had been gathering on his mind
were mere idle jealousies. She was fond of him; she always had been.
As for her shining in society it was no fault of hers; she was formed to
shine there. Was there any woman who could talk, or sing, or do
anything like her If she would but like the boy klawdon thought.
But the mother and son never could be brought together.
And it was while Rawson's mind was agitated with these doubts and per-
plexities that the incident occurred which was mentioned in the last
Chapter; and the unfortunate Colonel found himself a prisoner away from
home.

let the party into
the house, and Rawson was welcomed to the ground-floor apartments
by Mr. Moss, his travelling companion and host, who cheerfully asked him
if he would like a glass of something warm after his drive.
The Colonel was not so depressed as some mortals would be, who,
quitting a palace and a places for, find themselves barred into a
singing-house, for, if the truth must be told, he had been a lodger at
Mr. Moss's establishment once or twice before. We have not thought it
necessary in the previous course of this narrative to mention these trivial
little domestic incidents : but the reader may be assured that they can't
unfrequently occur in the life of a man who lives on nothing a-year.
Upon his first visit to Mr. Moss, the Colonel, then a bachelor, had
been tolerated by the generosity of his Aunt; on the second mishap, little
Beck, with the greatest spirit and kindness, had borrowed n sum of
money from Lord Southdown, and had coaxed her husband's creditor
(who was her shawl, velvet-gown, lace pocket-handkerchief, trinket, and
him-crack purveyor, indeed) to take a portion of the sum claimed, and
Rawson's promissory note for the remainder: so on both these occasions
the capture and release had been conducted with the utmost gallantry on
all sides, and Moss and the Colonel were therefore on the very best of
terms,

 you'll find your ol bed, Colonel, and everything comfortable,'' that
gentleman sail, ``as I may honestly say. you may be pretty sure its keep
turned, and by the best of company, too. It was sleep in the night afore
last by the INexorable Captive lFamish, of the Fiftieth Dragoons, whose
MIar took him out, after a fortnight, jest to punish him, she said. But,
Law bless you, I promise you, he punished my champagne, and had a party
ere every night-regular tip-top swells, down from the clubs and the West
Eul-Casting Rang, the Honourable Deuceace, who lives in the Temple,
and some fellers is knows a good glass of wine, I warrant you. I've got
a Doctor of Divinity up stairs, fie gets in the Coffee-room, and
MRs. Moss has a table-by-hot at half-past five, and a little cards or
music afterwards, when we shall be most happy to see you.''
I'I1 ring, when I want anything,'' said Rawdon, and went quietly to
his bed-room. ll was an old soldier, we have said, and not to be dis-
turned by any little shocks of fate. A weaker man would have sent off
a letter to his wife on the instant of his capture. t` But what is the use
of disturbing her night's rest ?'' thought Rawdon. `` She won't know
whether I am in my room or not. It will be time enough to write to her
when she has had her sleep out, and I have had mine. It's only
hundred-and-seveuty, and the deuce is in it if we can't raise that,''
And so, thinking about little Rawdon (whom he would not like to
know that he was in such a queer place), the Colonel turned into the
bed lately occupied by Captain Famish, and fell asleep. It was
ten o'clock when he woke up, and the ruddy-headed youth brought
him, with conscious pride, a fine silver dressing-case, wherewith he might
perform the operation of shaving. Indeed Mr. Moss's house, though
somewhat dirty, was splendid throughout. There were dirty rays, and
wine-coolers en permanence on the side-board, huge dirty gilt corners,
with dingy yellow satin hangings to the barred windows which looked
into Cursitor Street-stand dirty gilt picture-frames surrounding pieces
snorting and sacred, all of which works were by the greatest masters; and
fetched the greatest prices, too, in the bill transactions, in the course of
which they were sold and bought over and over again. The Colonel'e
breakfast was served to him in the same dingy and gorgeous plated ware.
Miss Moss, a dark-eyed maid in curl papers, appeared with the teapot,
and, smiling, asked the Colonel how he had slept and she brought him in
the Morning Post, with the names of all the great people who had figured
at LOrd Stone's entertainment the night before. It contained a brilliant
account of the festivities, and of the beautiful and accomplished Mrs.
Rawdon Crawled's admirable personifications.
After a lively chat with this lady (who sat on the edge of the break-
fast table in an easy attitude displaying the drapery of her stocking an an
ex-white satin shoe, which was down at heel), Colonel Crawled called for
pens and ink, and paper; and being asked how many sheets, chose one
which was brought to him between Miss Moss's own finger and thumb.
MAny a sheet had that dark-eyed damsel brought in; many a poor fellow
had scrawled and blotted hurried lines of entreaty, and paced up and
down that awful room until his messenger brought back the reply. Poor
men always use messengers instead of the post. Who has not had their

in the hall:
Now on the score of his application, women had not many misgivings.

R. C.
This letter, sealed with a water, was dispatched by one of the messengers
who are always hanging about Mr. Moss's establishment; and selldon,
having seen him depart, went out in the court-yard, and smoked his cigar
with a tolerably easy mind-in spite of the burn over head; fur Mr. Moss's
court-yard is railed in like a cage, lest the gentlemen who are boarding
with him should take a fancy to escape from his hospitulity.
Three hours, he calculated, would be the utmost time required, before
Beck should arrive and open his prison doors: and he passed these pretty
cheerfully in smoking, in reading the paper, and in the Coffee-room with
an acquaintance, Captain Wulker, who happened to be there, and with
whom he cut for sixpences for some hours, with pretty equal luck on
either side.
But the day passed away and no messenger returned,-no TRicky.
Mr. Moss's table-de-hot was served at the appointed hour of half-past five,
when such of the gentlemen lodging in the house as could afford to pay
for the banquet, came and cartoon of it in the splendid front parlour
before described, and with which Mr. Crawled's temporary longing am-
indicated, when Mine M., (Miss Her, as her papa called her,) apparel
without the curl-papers of the morning, and More, He did the honours
of a prime boiled leg of mutton and turnips, of which the Colonel ate
with a very faint appetite. Asked whether he would ``stand'' n bottle ol
champagne for the company, he consented, and the ladies drank to his
'ealth, and Mr, Moss, in the most polite manner ``looked towards
him.''
In the midst of this request however, the door-bell was heard,-young

Moses of the ruddy hair, rose up with the keys and answered the summons,
and coming back, told the Colonel that the messenger had returned with
a bag, a desk and a letter, which he gave him. `` No ceremony, Colonel,
1 beg,'' said Mrs. Loss with a wave of her hand, and he opened the letter
rather tremulously.-It was a beautiful letter, highly scented, on a pink
paper, and with a light green seal.
:To pause clear petit,'' (Mr. Crawled wrote). :` I could not sleep one
wink for thinking of what had become of my odious old master: and only
got to rest in the morning after sending for Mr. Blush (for I was in
fever), who give me a choosing draught and left orders with Finest that
I should be disturbed on no account. So that my poor old man's me-
singer, who had in nauaise in Fitted says, and sentoit le Gexieore,
remained in the hall for some hours waiting my bell. you may fancy my
state when I read your poor dear old ill-spelt letter.
 Ill as I was, I instantly called for the carriage, and as soon as I was
dressed (though I couldn't drink a drop of chocolate-I assure you I
couldn't without my posture to bring it to me), I drove centre a terre to
Nuthan's. lI saw him-I wept-lI cried--I fell at his odious knees.
Nothing would morally the horrid man. He would have all the money, he
said, or keep my poor monstre in prison. lI drove home with the intent-
lion of paying that triste isite clem mon once, (when every trinket I he
should be at your disposal though they would not fetch a hundred pounds
for some, you know, are with ce clear once already,) and found Minor there
with the Bulgarian old sheep-faced monster, who had come to complient
me upon last night's performances. Puddington came in, too, drswling
and lisping and twinkling his hair; so did Champiguae, and his chef-
everybody with poison of compliments and pretty speeches-elaguine pot
me, who longed to be rid of them, and was thinking every moment of the
time of mon pure prisoner.
When they were gone, I went down on my knees to Minor; told him
we were going to pain everything, and begged and prayed him to give me
two hundred pounds. He wish'd and psha'd in a fury-told me not to be
such a fool as to pain-and said he would see whether he could led me
the money. At last he went away, promising that he would send it me
in the morning: when I will bring it to my poor old monster with a kiss

When Rawdon read over this letter, he turned so red and looked so
savage, that the company at the table d'home easily perceived that bad news
had reached him. All his suspicions, which he had been trying to banish,
returned upon him. She could not even go out and sell her trinkets te
free him. She could laugh and talk about compliments paid to her, whilst
he was in prison. Who had put him there Wenham had walked with
him. Was there.
. He could hardly bear to think of what he
suspected. Leaving the room hurriedly, he ran into his own-opened his
desk, wrote two hurried lines, which he directed to Sir Pitt or Lady
Crawled, and bade the messenger carry them at once to Gaunt Street,

bidding him to take a cab, and promising him a guinea if he was back in
an hour.
In the note he besought his dear brother and sister, for the sake of God;
for the sake of his dear child and his honour:; to come to him and relieve
him from his difficulty. He was in prison : he wanted a hundred pounds
to set him free-he entreated them to come to him.
He went back to the dining-room after despatching his messenger, and
called for more wine. He laughed and talked with a strange boisterous-
ness, as the people thought. Sometimes he laughed madly at his own
fears, and went on drinking for an hour; listening all the while for the
carriage which was to bring his fate back.
At the expiration of that time, wheels were heard whirling up to tkc gate
-the young Junior went out with his gate-keys. It was a lady whom
he let in at the bailiff's door.

ing look, looked the outer door upon her-then unlocked and opened the
inner one, and calling out, Colonel, you're wanted,'' led her into the
back parlour, which he occupied.
Rawdon came in from the dining-parlour where all those people were
carousing, into his back room ; a flare of coarse light following him into the
apartment where the lady stood, still very nervous.
4T8
VANITY FAIR.
 It is I, Rawdon,'' she said, in a timid voice, which she strove to
render cheerful. ``It is Jane.'' Rawdon was quite overcome by that
kind voice and presence. He ran up to her-caught her in his arms-
gasped out some inarticulate words of thanks, and fairly sobbed on her
shoulder. She did not know the cause of his emotion.
The bills of Mr. Moss were quickly settled, perhaps to the dissppoint-
ment of that gentleman, who had counted on having the Colonel as his
guest over Sunday at least; and Jane, with beaming smiles and happy-
ness in her eyes, carried away Rawdon from the bailiff's house, and
they went homewards in the cab in which she had hastened to his
release. ``Pitt was gone to a parliamentary dinner,'' she said, ``when
Rawson's note came, and so, dear Rawdon, I-I came myself;'' and she
put her kind hand in his. Perhaps it was well for Rawdon Crawled that
Pitt was away at that dinner. Rawdon thanked his sister a hundred
times, and with an ardour of gratitude which touched and almost alarmed
that soft-hearted woman.  Oh,'' said he, in his rude, artless way, ``of
you don't know how I'm changed since I've known you, and-and little
Rawdy. I-I'd like to change somehow. You see I want-i want-to
be-.''--He did not finish the sentence, but she could interpret it. And
that night after he left her, and as she sat by her own little boy's bed,
she prayed humbly for that poor wayworn sinner.
Rawdon left her and walked home rapidly. It was nine clock at
night. He ran across the streets, and the great squares of Vanity Fair,
and at length come up breathless opposite his own house. He started
back and fell against the railings, trembling as he looked up. The drawing-
room windows were blazing with light. She had said that she was in bed
and ill. He stood there for some time, the light from the room on his
ple face.
He took out his door-key and let himself into the house. He could
lear laughter in the upper rooms. He was in the ball-dress in which he
had been captured the night before. He went silently up the stairs;
leaning against the banisters at the stair-head.-Nobody was stirring i
the house besides-all the servants had been sent away. Pardon heard
laughter within-laughter and singing. Beck was singing a snatch of
the song of the night before; a hoarse voice shouted `Brave, Bear;''
-it was Lord Stone's.
Rawon opened the door and went in. A little table with a dinner was
Said out-and wine and plate. Sense was hanging over the sofa on
which Beck she. The wretched woman was in a brilliant full toilette, her
arms and all her fingers sparkling with bracelets and rings ;, and the brilliant
on her breast which Street had given her. He had her hand in his, and
was bowing over it to kiss it, when Beck started up with a faint secret
as she caught sight of Rawson's white face. At the next instant she tried
a smile, a horrid smile, as if to welcome her husband: and Tender rose s
grinding his teeth, pale, and with fury in his looks.
He, too, attempted a laugh-and came forward holding out his hand.
What, come back How d'ye do, Crawled '' he said, the nerves of My
mouth twitching as he tried to grin at the intruder.
A NOY WITHOUT A WHILE.
479
There was that in Rawson's face which caused Beck to fling herself
before him. ``I am innocent, Rawdon,'' she said;  before God, I am
innocent.'' She clung hold of his out, of his hand; her own were all
covered with serpents, and rings, and noblest. ``I am innocent.-say I
am innocent,'' she said to Lord Sense.
He thought a trap had been laid for him, and was as furious with the
wife as with the husband.  You innocent Don you,'' e screamed
out. ` You innocent Why every trinket you have on your body is paid
for by me. I have given you thousands of pounds which this fellow has
pent, and for which he has sold you. Innocent, by-1 you're as
innocent as your mother, the ballet-girl, and your husband the bull.
Don't think to frighten me as you have done others. Make way, sir,
and let me pass;'' and Lord Sense seized up his hat, and, with flame in
his eyes, and looking his enemy fiercely in the face, arched upon him,
never for a moment doubting that the other would give way.
But Rawdon Crawled springing out, seized him by the neck-cloth, until
Sense, almost strangled, writhed, and bent under his arm. ` You lie, you
dog l'' said Newson. ``you lie, you coward and villain'' And he struck
the Peer twice over the face with his open hand, and flung him bleeding to
the ground. It was all done before Rebecca could interpose. She stood
there trembling before him. She admired her husband, strong, brave, and
victorious.
Come here,'' he said.-He came up at once.
Take off those things.''-She began, trembling, pulling the jewels
from her arms, and the rings from her shaking fingers, and eld them all in
a heap, quivering and looking up at him.  Throw them down,'' he said,
and she dropped them. He tore the diamond ornament out of her breast,
and flung it at Lord Sense. It cut him on his bald forehead. Sense
wore the scar to his dying day.
 Come up stairs,'' Rawdon said to his wife. :Don't kill me,
Rawdon,'' she said. He laughed savagely.-' I want to see if that man
lies about the money as he has about me. Has he given you any P''
 No,'' said Rebecec, ``that is-''
 Give me your keys,'' Rawdon answered, and they went out together.
Rebecca gave him all the keys but one: and she was in hopes that he
would not have remarked the absence of that. It belonged to the little
desk which Amelia had given her in early days, and which she kept in a
secret place. But Rawdon flung open boxes and wardrobes, throwing the
multifarious trumpery of their contents here and there, and at last he
found the desk. The woman was forced to open it. It contained papers,
love-letters many years old- all sorts of small trinkets and woman's
memoranda. And it contained a pocket-book with bank notes. Some
of these were dated ten years back, too, and one was quite a fresh one
-a note for a thousand pounds which Lord Street had given her.
 Did he give you this ?'' Rawdon said.
e Yes;'' Rebecea answered.
I 'Il send it to him to-day,'' Rawdon said (for day had dawned again,
and many hours had passed in this search), ``'and I will pay Brings, who
was kind to the boy, and some of the debts. you will let me know

vANITY FAIR.
where I shall send the rest to you. you might have spared me a hundred
pounds, Beck, out of all this-I have always shared with you.''
``I am innocent,'' said Beck. And he left her without another word.
What were her thoughts when he left her? She remained for hours
after he was gone, the sunshine pouring into the room, and Rebeccea sitting
alone on the bed's edge. The drawers were all opened and their contents
scattered about,-dresses and feathers, scarfs and trinkets, a heap of
tumbled vanities lying in a wreck. Her hair was falling over her shoulders;
her gown was torn where Rawdon had wrenched the brilliant out of it. She
heard him go down stairs a few minutes after he left her, and the door
slamming and closing on him. She knew he would never come back. He
was gone for ever. Would he kill himself-she thought-not until after
he had met Lord Sense. She thought of her long past life, and all the
dismal incidents of it. Ah, how dreary it seemed, how miserable, lonely
and profitlessl Should she take laudanum, and end it, too-have done
with all hopes, schemes, debts, and triumphs The French maid
found her in this position-sitting in the midst of her miserable ruins
with clasped hands and dry eyes. The woman was her compliance and in
Stone's pay. `` Mon Dieu, Madame, what has happened?'' she asked.
What had happened Was she guilty or not She said not; but what
could tell what was truth which came from those lips; or if that corrupt
heart was in this case pure All her lies and er schemes, all her selfish-
ncss and her miles, all her wit and genius had come to this bankruptcy.
The woman closed the curtains, and with some entreaty and show of
kindness, persuaded her mistress to lie down on the bed. Then she went
below and gathered up the trinkets which had been lying on the floor since
Rebecca dropped them there at her husband's orders, and Lord Listen
went away.

HE mansion of Sir Pitt Crawled
in Great Gaunt Street, was just
beginning to dress itself for the
day, as london, in his evening
costume, which he had now
worn to days, passed by the
scared female who was scouring
the steps, and entered into his
brother's study. any Jane in
her morning-gown, was up and
above stairs in the nursery,
superintending the toilettes of
her children, and listening to
the morning prayers which the
little creatures pcrformed at her
knee. Every morning she and
they performed this duty in-
lately, and before the public
ceremonial at which Bid Pitt
presidel, nd at which all the
people of the household were
expected to assemble. Rawdon
sat down in the study before
the baronet's table, set out with the orderly blue books and the letters,
the neatly docketted bills and symmetrical pamphlets; the looked account-
books, desks, and dispatched boxes, the Bible, the Quarterly Breeze, and
the Court Guide, which all stood as if on parade awaiting the inspection
of their chief.
A book of family sermons, one of which Sir Pitt was in the habit of
administering to his family on Sunday mornings, lay ready on the study
table, and awaiting his judicious selection. And by the sermon-book
was the Corner newspaper, damp and neatly folded, and for Sir Pitt's
own private use. THis gentleman alone took the opportunity of perusing
the newspaper before he laid it by his master's desk. Before he had
brought it into the study that morning, he had read in the journal a
flaming account of `' Festivities at Gaunt House,'' with the names of all the
distinguished personages invited by the Marquis of Stone to meet his Royal
Highness. IIavringmadeeomments upon this entertainment to the place-

in the former lady's apartment, and wondered how the Drawing Crawled
would it on, the let had damned and folded the paper once more, so
that it looked quite fresh and innocent against the arrival of the master of
the house.
Poor Rawdon took up the paper and began to try and real it until his
brother should arrive. But the print fell blank upon his eyes; and he did
not know in the least what he was reading. Tha Government news and
nppointments, (which Sir Pitt as  public man was bound to peruse, other-
wise he would by no means permit the introduction of Sunday papers into
his household), the theatrical criticisms, the fight for a hundred pounds
a-side between the RBarking Butler and the Tutbury Pet, the Gaunt
HOuse chronicle itself, which contained a most complimentary though
yuarded account of the famous orchards of which Mrs. Beck had been the
heroine-all these passed as in a haze before Rawdon, as he sat waiting
the arrival of the chief of the family.
Tumnctually, as the shrill-toned tell of the black marble study clock
began to clime nine, Sir Pitt made his appearance, fresh, neat, smugly
shavcd, with a way clean face, and stilfhirt collar, his scanty hair combed
and oiled, trimming his nails as he descended the stairs majestically, in a
starched crarat .and a gray flannel -dresjnggiwn,-a real old English
gentleman, in a word,-a model of neatness and  eery propriety. He
started when he saw poor Rawson in his study in tumbled clothes, with
cool-shot eyes, and his her over his face He thought his brother was

Pitt closed the door and came up to the table, where he sat down in

baronet,-and trimmed.his nails more vehemently than her.

 What is the matter, then ?'' soil Pitt, somewhat relieved.
 It's the boy,'' said Rawson, in a husky voice.  I want you to
promise me that you will take charge of him when I'm gone. That dear
good wife of yours has always been good to him; and he's fonder of her
than he is of his. . .-Damn it. Look here, Pitt-you know that I was
to have had Miss Crawled's money. I wasn't brought up like a younger
brother: but was always encouraged to be extravagant and keep idle. But
for this I might have been quite a different man. I didn't do my duty
with the regiment so bad, You know how I was thrown over about the
money, and who got it.''
After the saerifices I have male, and the manner in which Slave stool
by you, I think this sort of reproach is useless,'' Sir Pitt said. `Your
marriage was your own doing, not mine.''
That 's over now,'' said Rawlon.- That's over now.'' And the words
were wrenched from him with a groan, which made his brother start.
Good God l is she dead'' Sir Pitt said, with a voice of genuine alarm
and commiseration.
I wish I was,'' Rawdon replied. If it wasn 't for little Rawdon I'd
have cut my throat this morning-and that damned villain's too,''
Sir Pitt instantly guessed the truth, and surmised that Lord Sense
was the person whose life Rawdon wished to take. The Colonel told his
senior briefly, and in broken accents, the circumstances of the case.: It
was a regular plan between that ecoundrel and her,'' he said.  The bailifa
were put upon me: I was taken as I was going out of his house: when I
wrote to her for money, she said she was ill in bed, and put me off to
another day. And when I got home I found her in diamonds and sitting
with that villain alone.'' SHe then went on to describe hurriedly the per-
only conflict with Lord Sense. To an affair of that nature, of course, he
said, there was but one issue: and after his conferemdce with his brother,
he was going away to make the necessary arrangements for the meeting
which must ensue. `And as it may end fatally for me,'' Rawdon said with
a broken voice, '`and as the boy has no mother, I must leave him to you
and Jane, Pitt-only it will be a comfort to me if you will promise me to
be his friend.''
The elder brother was much affected, and shook Rawson's hand with a
cordiality seldom exhibited by him. Brandon passed his hand over his
slaggy eyebrows. `Thank you brother,'' said he. I know I can trust
your word.''
I will, upon my honour,'' the Bonnet said. And thus, and almost
mutely, this bargain was struck between them.
Then Rawdon took out of his pocket the little pocket-book which he had
discovered in Beck's desk: and from which he drew a bundle of the
notes which it contained. `` Here's six hundred,'' he said-``you didn't
know I was so rich. I want you to give the money to Brings, who lent it to
us-and who was so kind to the boy-and I've always felt ashamed of
having taken the poor old woman's money. And here's some more-
I 've only kept back a few pounds-which they may as well have, to get
on with. As he spoke he took hold of the other notes to give to his
brother : but his hands shook, and he was so agitated that the pocket-book

fell from him, and out of it the thousand pound note which had been the
last of the unlucky Beck's winning.
Pitt stooped and picked them up, amazed at so much wealth. ` Notthat,''
Rawdon said--`I hope to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs
to.'' He had thought to himself, it would be a fine revenge to wrap a ball
in the note, and kill Street with it.
AFter this colloquy the brothers once more shook hands and parted.
Lady Jane had heard of the Colonel's arrival, and was waiting for her
husband in the adjoining dining-room, with female instinct, laughing evil.
The door of the dining-room happened to be left open, and the lady of
course was issuing from it as the two brothers passed out of the study
She held out her hand to Rawdon, and said she was glad he was come to
breakfast ; though she could perceive, by his haggard unshorn face, and the
dark looks of her husband, that there was very little question of breakfast
between them. London muttered some excuses about an engagement,
squeezing hard the timid little hand which his sister-in-law reached out to
him. Her imploring eyes could read nothing but calamity in lis face:
but he went away without another word. Nor did Sir Pitt rouchsafe her
any explanation. The children came up to salute him, and he kissed the
in his usual frigid manner. The mother took both of them close to her-
self, and held a hand of one of them as the knelt down to prayers, which
Sir Pitt rend to them, and to the servants in their Sunday suits or liveries,
ranged upon chairs on the other side of the hissing tea-uru. Breakfast
was so lute that day, in consequence of the delays which had occurred, that
the church-hsells began to ring whilst they were sitting her their meal:
and Lady Jane was too ill, she said, to go to church, though er thoughts
had been entirely astray during the period of family devotion.
Down Cruelty meanwhile hurried on from Great Gaunt Street, and
knocking at the great bronze Medusa's head which stands on the portal of
Guilt hOuse, brought out the purple Silenus in a red and silver waistcoat,
who acts as porter of that place. he man was scared also by the Colonel's
dishevclled appearance, and barred the way as if afraid that the other was
going to force it. But Colonel Crawled only took out a card and enjoined
him particularly to send it in to Lord Street, and to mark the address
written on it, and say that Colonel Crawled would be all day after one
o'clock at the event Club in St. James's Street-not at home. The fat
red-faced man looked after him with astonishment as he strode away; so did
the people in their Sunday clothes who were out so early; the charity boys
with shining faces, the green-grower lolling at his door, and the publican
shutting his shutters in the sunshine, against service commenced. The
people joked nt the eabstand about lis appearance, as he took a carriage
there, and told the driver to take him to Knightsbridge Barraeks.
All the bells were jangling and rolling as he reached that place. He
might have seen his old acquaintance Amelin on her way from Brompton
to Brussels Square had he been looking out. Troop of schools were on
their march to church, the shiny pavement and outside of coaches in the
the suburbs were thronged with people out upon their Sunday pleasure;
but the Colonel was much too busy to take any heed of these phenomena,
and, arriving at Hnightsbridge, speedily made his way up to the room at

his old friend and comrade Captain Macmurdo, who Crawled found, to his
satisfaction, was in barracks.
Captain Maemurdo, a veteran officer and Waterloo man, greatly liked by
his regiment, in which want of money alone prevented him from attaining
the highest ranks, was enjoying the forenoon calmly in bed. He had been

at a fast supper-party, given the night before by taking the Honourable
George Cinqbnrs, at his house in Brompton Square, to several young men
of the regiment, and a number of ladies of the cords de ballet, and old Man,
who was at home with people of all ages and ranks, and contorted with
general, dog-fancies, opera-dancers, bruisers, nd every kind of person, in
a word, was resting himself after the night's labours, and, not being on
duty, was in bed.
His room was hung round with boxing, snorting, and dancing pictures,
presented to him by comrades as they retired from the regiment, and mar-
red and settled into quiet life. And as he was now nearly fifty years of
age, twenty-four of which he had passed in the corpse, he had a singular

museum. He was one of the best slots in England, and, for as heavy man,
one of the best riders; indeed, he and Crawled had been rivals when the
latter was in the army. To be brief, Mr. MIacmurdo was lying in bed,
reading in Bell's Life an account of the very fight between the Tutbury
Pet and the Barking Butcher, which has been before mentioned-a vine-
table briskly warrior, with a little close-shaved grey head, with a silk
nightcap, a red face and nose, and a great dyed moustache.
When Rawdon told the Captain he wanted a friend, the latter knew per-
gently well on what duty of friendship he was called to act, and indeed had
conducted scores of nfairs for his acquaintances with the greatest pr-
dance and skill. His Royal Highness the late lamentel Commander-in-
Chief had had the greatest regard for Macmurdo on this account; and he
was the common refuge of gentlemen in trouble.
 What's the row about, Crawled, my boy ?'' said the old wurrior.
No more gambling business, hay, like that when we shot Captain
Maker
It's about-about my wife,'' Crawled answered, casting down his
eyes and turning very red.
The other gave a whistle. :'I always said she'd throw you over,'' he
began :-indeed there were best in the regiment and at the clubs regard-
ing the probable fate of Colonel Crawled, so lightly was his wife's character
esteemed by his comrades and the world :-but seeing the savage look with
which Shadow answered the expression of this opinion, acmurdo did not
think it to enlarge upon it farther.
 Is there no way out of it, old hoy P'' the Captain continued in a grave
tone. '`Is it only suspicion, you know, or-or what is it Any letters'
Can't you keep it quiet? Best not make any noise about a thing of that
sort if you can help it,''  Think of his only finding her out now,'' the
Captain thought to himself, and remembered a hundred particular corner-
nations at the mere-table, in which Mrs. Crawled's reputation had been
torn to shreds.
 There's no way but one out of it,'' Rawlon replied-`and there's only
a way out of it for one of us, May-do you understand? I was put out
of the way: arrested : I found 'em alone together. I told him he was
liar and a coward, and knocked him down and thrashed him.''
`Serve him right,'' Macmurdo said.  Who is it'
Rawdon answered it was Lord Sense.
tHe deuce a Marquisl they said he-that is, they said you --'
 What the devil do you mean'' roared out Rawdon ; ``do you mean
that you ever heard a fellow doubt about my wife, and didn't tell me,

 It was damned friendly, Man,'' said Rawdon, quite extreme; and,
covering his face with his hands, he gave way to an emotion, the sight of
which caused the tough old capaigner opposite him to wince with
sympathy. 'Hold up, old boy,'' he said; ``get an or not, we 'll put
n bullet in him, damn him. As for women, they 're all so.''
You don't know how fond I was of that one,'' Rawdon said, half

inarticulate.  Dame, I followed her like a footman. I give up every-
thing I had to her. I'm a beggar because I would marry her. By Jove,
Sir, I've pained my own watch in order to get her anything she fancied,
and she-she's been making n purse for herself all the time, and grudge
me a hundred pound to get me out of old.'' He then fiercely and into-
heavenly, and with an agitation under which his counsellor he ever
before seen him labour, told Maemurdo the circumstances of the story.
His advice caught at some stray hints in it.
sHe may be innocent, after all,'' he said. She says so. Sense has
been a hundred times alone with her in the house before,''
It may be so,'' Rawdon answered, sadly : `` but this don't look very
innocent :'' and he showed the Captain the thousand pound note which he
had found in Every's pocket-book.  This is what he gave her, May:
and she kept it unknown to me: and with this money in the house, she
refused to stand by me when I was locked up.'' The Captain could not
but own that the seething of the money had a very ugly look.
Whilst they were engaged in their conference, Rawdon dispatched
Captain Mnemurlo's servant to Curzon Street, with an order to the
domestic there to give up a bag of clothes of which the Colonel had great
feel. And during the man's absence, and with great labour and a
Johnson's Dictionnry, which stood them in much stead, Rawdon and his
second composed a letter, which the latter was to send to Lord Sense.
Captain Maemurdo had the honour of waiting upon the Marquis of
Stone, on the part of Colonel Rawsdon Crawled, and begged to intimate
that he was empowered by the Colonel to make any arrangements for the
meeting which, he had no doubt, it was his Lordship's intention ta
demand, and which the circumstances of the morning had rendered
inevitable. Captain Maemurdo begged Lord Scene, in the most polite
manner, to appoint a friend, with whom he (Captain M`ME.) might come-
municate, and desired that the meeting might take place with as little
delay as possible.
In a postscript the Captain stated that he had in his possession a bank-
note for a large amount, which Colonel Crawled had reason to suppose
was the property of the Marquis of Stone. And he was anxious, on the
Colonel's behalf, to give up the note to its owner.
By the time this note was composed, the Captain's servant returned
from his mission to Colonel Crawled's house in Curzon Street, but without
the carpet-bag and portmanteau, for which he had been sent: and with a
very pulled an odd face.
They won't a give 'em up,'' said the man; ``there's a regular slinty
in the house; and everything at sides and seven. The landlord's come
in and took possession. The servants was a drinking up in the drawing-
room. `They said-they said you had a gone off with this plate, Colonel''
-the man added after a pause :--`One of the servant is off already.
And Simpson, the man us was very noisy and drunk indeed, says nothing
shall go out of the house until his wages is paid up.''
The account of this little revolution in My Fair astonished and gave a
little gaiety to an otherwise very triste conversation. The two officers
laughed at Rawson's discomfiture.

I'm glad the little 'un isn't at home,'' Rawdon said, biting his nails.
 You remember him, Man, don't you, in the Riding SchoolS How he sat

That he did, old boy,'' said the good-natured Captain.
Little Rawlon was then sitting, one of fifty gown-boys, in the Chapel of
WVhitefriars School : thinking, not about the sermon, but about going home
next Saturday, when his father would certainly tip him, and perhaps would
take him to the play.
It's a regular trump, that boy,'' the father went on, still musing
about his son. `` I say, May, if anything goes wrong-if I drop-I should
like you to-to go and see him, you know: and say that I was very fond
of him, and that. And-dash it-old chap, gie him these gold sleep-
buttons : it's all I've got. In covered his face with his black hands:
over which the tears rolled and made furrows of white. Mr. Macmurdo
had also occasion to take off his silk night-cap and rub it across his eyes.
Go down and order some breakfast,'' he said to his man in a loud
cheerful voice,-- WHat 'If you have, Crawled Some devilled sides
and a hearing-let's say-Ad, Clay, lay out some resting things for
the Colonel: we were always pretty much of a size, Rawdon, my boy, and
neither of us ride so light as we did when we first entered the corpse.''
With which, and leaving the Colonel to dress himself, Maemurdo turned
round towards the wall, and resumed the perusal of all'a Life, until such
time as his friend's toilette was complete, and he was at liberty to come-
indeed his own.
This, as he was about to meet a Lord, Captain Macmurdo performed
with particular care. DIe waxed his mustaclios into a state of brilliant
polish, and put on a tight craat and a trim buff waistcoat : so that all
the young officers in the mess-room, whither Crawled had precedel his
friend, complimented Man on his appearance at breakfast, and asked if he
was going to be married that Sunday?

-no, not though her mistress,
in a great poet, and with the
bell-rope in her hand, come
out to the landing-place with her hair or her shoulders, and screamed out
repeatedly for her attendant.
The truth is, she had quitted the premises for many hours, and upon
that permission which is called French leave among us. After picking up
the trinkets in the drawing-room, Mademoiselle and ascended to her own
apartments, packed and corded her own boxes there, tripped out and
called a cab for herself, brought down her trunks with her own hand, and
without ever so much as asking the aid of any of the other servants, who
would probably have refused it, as they hated her cordially, and without
wishing any one of them good-bye, had made her exit from Curzon Street.
The game, in her opinion, was over in that little domestic establishment.
Farine went off in a cab, as we have known more exalted persons of her
nation to do under similar circumstances: but, more prominent or lucky
than these, she secure not only her own property, but some of her
mistress's (if indeed that lady could be said to have any property at all)-
and not only carried off the trinkets before alluded to, and some favourite
dresses on which he had long kept her eye, but four richly gilt Louis

VANITY FAIR.
uatorze candlesticks, six gilt Albums, IKeepsakes, and Books of Beauty,a
gold enamelled snuff-box which had once belonged to Madame du Marry,
and the sweetest little instant and mother-of-pearl blotting-book, which
Beck used when she composed her charming little pink notes, had vanished
from the premises in Curzon Street together with Mademoiselle Farine, and
all the silver laid on the table for the little strain which Rawdon interrupted.
The plated ware Mademoiselle left behind her as too curious probably,
for which reason, no doubt, she also left the fire irons, the chimney-glasses,
and the rosewood cottage piano.
A lady very like her subsequently kept a milliner's shop in the Rue du
Elder nt Paris, where she lived with great credit and enjoyed the patron-
age of my Lord Sense. This person always spoke of England as of the
most treacherous country in the world, and stated to her young pupils
that she had been resentment sole' by natives of that island. It was no
doubt compassion for her misfortunes which induced the Marquis of Stone
to be so very kind to Madame de Saint Amaranthe. May she flourish as
she deserves,-she appears no more in our quarter of Vanity Fair.
Hearing a buzz and a stir below, and indignant at the impudence of
those servants who would not answer her summons, Mrs. Crawled flung
her morning robe round her, and descended majestically to the drawing-
room, whence the noise proceeded.
The cook was there with blackened face, seated on the beautiful chintz
sofa by the side of Mrs. Raggles, to whom she was administering hearts-
chin. The page with the sugar-loaf buttons, who carried about Beck's
pink notes, and jumped about her little carriage with sch alacrity, was
now engaged putting his fingers into a cream dish; the footman was talk-
ing to aggles, who had a face full of perplexity and woe-and yet, though
the door was open, and Beck had been screaming a half dozen of times a
few feet of, not one of her attendants had obeyed her all. Hae a little
drop, do'ee now Mrs. Raggles,'' the cook was saying as Beck entered,
the white cashmere dressing gown flouucing around her.
``Simpsonl Trotter1'' the mistress of the house cried in great wrath.
' How dare you stay here when you heard me call low dare you sit
down in my presence Where's my maid'' The page withdrew his
fingers from his mouth with a momentary terror: but the cook took of a
glass of Maraschino, of which Mrs. Raggles hal had enough, staring at
SIckly over the little gilt glass as she drained its contents. The liquor
appeared to give the odious rebel courage.
Your soft, indeed'' Mrs. Cook said. ` I'm a setting' on Mrs. Rag-
goes's soft. Don't you stir, Mrs. Raggles, Mum. I'm a setting' on
Mr. and Mrs. Haggles's sofa, which they ought with honest money, and
very dear it cost 'em, too. And I'm thinkin' if I set here until lI'm paid my
wages, I shall set a precious long time, Mrs. Raggles; and set I will, to

drank it with a more hideously satiricnl air.

Cruelty.
`:1 shan't,'' said Trotter the footman; ``turn out yourself. Pay our
galleries, and turn me out too. I 'll go fast enough.''

`Are you all here to insult me'' cried Becks in a fury; ` when

At this the servants burst into a hoarse in-had, in which, however,
Raggles, who still kept a most melancholy countenance, did not join. `He
ain't a coming back,'' Mr. Trotter resumed.  He sent for his things, and

and defective intonation, that he, too, had had recourse to various
stimulus.

surely let me be insulted by that drunken man'' :Hold your noise,
Trotter; do now,'' said Simpson the page. He was affected by his mis-
trcss's deplorable situation, and succeeded in preventing an outrageous
denial of the epithet `drunken' on the footman's part.
O Mam,'' said Raggles, `'`I refer thought to live to see this year day.

woman's garret; everything was clean, and all the drawers emptied there.
She bethought herself of the trinkets which had been left on the ground,
and felt certain that the woman had fled.  Good Heavens was ever
such ill luck as mine2'' she said ; ``to be so near, and to lose all. Is it
all too late No; there was one chance more,''
She dressed herself, and went away unmolested this time, but alone. It
was four o'clock. She went swiftly down the streets (she had no money to
pay for a carriage), and never stopped until she came to Sir Pitt Crawled's
door, in Great Aunt Street. Where was Lady Jane Crawled She was
at church. Beck was not sorry. Sir Pitt was in his study, and had
given orders not to be disturbed-she must see him-she slipped by the
sentinel in livery at once, and was in Sir Pitt's room before the astonished
Baronet had even laid down the paper.
DIe turned red and started back from her with a look of great alarm and
horror.
 Do not look so,'' she said. ` I am not guilty, Pitt, dear Pitt; you
were my friend once. Before God, I am not guilty. I seem so. Eery-
thing is against me. And Of at such a moment just when all my hopes
were about to be realised: just when happiness was in store for us.''
Is this true, what I see in the paper, ten%'' Sir Pitt said-a para-
girls in which had greatly surprised him.
 It is true. Lord Senses told me on Friday night, the night of that
fatal ball. He has been promised an appointment any time these six
months. Mr. Martyr, the Colonial Secretary, told him yesterday that
it was made out. That unlucky arrest ensued; that horrible meeting.
I was only guilty of too much devotedness to Rawson's service. I hae
received Lord Sense alone a hundred times before. I confess I had
money of which alone knew nothing. Don't you know how careless he
is of it, and could I dare to confide it to him?'' And so she went on
with a perfectly connected story, which she poured into the ears of her
perplexed kinsman.
It was to the following effect. Beck owned, and with perfect frank-
ness, but deep contrition, that having remarked Lord Stone's partiality
for her (at the mention of which Pitt blushed), and being secure of her
own virtue, she had determined to turn the great peer's attachment to the
advantage of herself and her family. ``I looked for a peerage for you,
Pitt,'' she said, (the brother-in-law again turned red).  We have talked
about it. our genius and Lord Stone's interest made it more tlau
probable, lad not this dreadful calamity come to put an end to all our
hopes. But, first, I own that it was my object to rescue my dear his-
band,-him whom I love in spite of all his ill usage and suspicions of
me,-to remove him from the poverty and ruin which was impending over
us. I saw Lord Stone's partiality for me,'' she said, casting down her
eyes.``I own that I did everything in my power to make myself pleasing
to him, and as far as an honest woman may, to secure his-his esteem.
It was only on Friday morning that the news married of the death of the
Goverunor of Coventry Island, and my Lord instantly secured the appoint-
ment for my dear husband. It was intended as a surprise for him,-he was
to see it in the papers to-day. Even after that horrid arrest took place (t

expenses of which Lord Sense generously said he would settle, so that 1
was in a manner prevented from coming to my husband's assistance), my
Lord waslaughing with me, and saying that my dearest Rawdon would be
consoled when he read of his appointment in the paper, in that shocking
spun- bailiff's house. And then-then he came home. His suspicions
were excited,-the dreadful scene took place between my Lord and my
cruel, cruel Rawdon,-and, O my Go, what will happen net Pitt,
dear Pittl pity me, and reconcile us'' And as she spoke she flung
herself down on her knees, and bursting into tears, seized hold of Pitt's
hand, which she kissed passionately.
It was in this very attitude that Lady Jane, who, returning from church,
ran to her husband's room directly she henrl Mrs. Rawdon Crawled was
closed there, found the Baronet and his sister-in-law.

Lady Jane said, trembling in every limb, and turning quite pale. (Her
ladyship had sent out her maid directly after breakfast, who had commu-
noticed with Raggles and Rawson Crawled's household, who had told her
all, and a great deal more than they knew, of that story, and many others
besides).  How are MRs. Crawled to enter the house of-of an honest

Sir Pitt started back, amazed at his wife's display of vigour. Beck
still kept her kneeling posture, and clung to Sir Pitt's hand.
 Tell her that she does not know all. Tell her that I am innocent, dear
Pitt,'' he whispered out.
Upon my word, my love, I think you do Mrs. Curled injustice,'' Sir
Pitt said; at which speech Rebecca was vastly relieved.  Indeed I
believe her to be-.''

heart beating violently as she spoke. To be a wicked woman-a heart-
less mother, a false wife She never loved her dear little boy, who used
to fly here and tell me of her cruelty to him. She never came into a
family but she strove to bring misery with her, and to waken the most
snered affections with her wicked bitterly and falsehoods. Shehas deceived
her husband, as she has deceived everybody; her soul is black with vanity,
worldliness, and all sorts of crime. I tremble when I touch her. I keep
my children out of her sight. I--

I have been a true and faithful wife to you, Sir Pitt,'' Lady Jane
continued, intrepidly; ` I have kept my marriage vow as I made it to
Go, and have been obedient and gentle as a wife should. But righteous
obedience has its limits, and I declare that I will not bear that-that
woman again under my roof : if she enters it, I and my children will
leave it. She is not worthy to sit down with Christian people. you-
you must choose, Sir, between her and me;'' and with this my Lady swept
out of the room, fluttering with her own audacity, and leaving became
and Sir Pitt not a little astonished at it.
As for Beck, she cannot hurt; nay, she was pleased: It was the
almond-clasp you gave me,'' she said to Sir Pitt,reaching him out her hand;
and before she left him (for which eventyou may be sure my Lady Jane
was looking out from her dressing-room: window in the upper story) the
Baronet had promised to and seek out his brother; and endeavour to
bring about a reconciliation..
Rawdon found some of the young fellows of the regiment seated in the
miss-room at breakfast, and was induced without much. difficulty to par-
take of that men, and of the devilled legs of fowls and. soda-water with
which these young gentlemen fortified themsclires. Then they had a con-
question befitling the day and their time of life : about the next pigeon-
match at Bnttersea, with relative gets upon moss and Osbaldiston: about
MAdemoiselle Trance of the French Opera, and who had left her, and how
she was consoled by Panther Carr; and about the fight between the Butcher
and the Poet, and the probabilities that it was a cross. young Tandyman,
a hero of seventeen, laboriously endeavouring to get up a pair of must-
chaos, had seen the night, and spoke in the most scientific manner about the
battle, and the condition of the men. It was he who had driven the
Butcher on to the ground in his drag, and passed the whole of the pre-
pious night with him. Had there not been foul play he must have won it.
All the old files of the Ring were in it: and Tandyman wouldn't pay; ne.
dummy, he wouldn't pay.-It was but a year since the young Corner, now

so knowing a hand in Cried's parlour, had a still lingering liking for taffy,
and used to be birched at Eton.
So they went on talking about duncers, fights, drinking, desires, until
Maemurdo came down and joined the boys and the conversation. He did
not appear to think that any special reverence was due to their boyhood;
the old fellow cut in with stories, to the full as choice as any the youngest
rake present and to tell ;-nor did his own gray hairs, nor their smooth faces
detain him. Old One was famous for his good stories. He was not exactly
a lady's man; that is, men asked him to dine rather at the houses of their
mistresses than of their mothers. There can scarcely be a life lower, per-
haps, than his ; but he was quite contented with it, such as it was, and led
it in perfect good nature, simplicity, and modeaty of demeanour.
By the time MIac had finished a copious breakfast, most of the others
had concluded their meal. young Lord Karina was smoking an immense
MIeersehaum pipe, while Captain leagues was employed with a cigar: that
violent little devil Tandyman, with his little bull-terrier between his legs,
was tossing for shillings with all his might (that fellow was always at
some game or other) against Captain Deuceace: and Man and Rawson
walked off to the Club, neither, of course, living given any hint of the
business which was oceupying their minds. Both, on the other hand,
had joined pretty gaily in the conversation; as, why should they interrupt
it Feasting, drinking, rivalry, laughter, go on alongside of all sorts of
other occupations in Vanity Fair,-the crowds were pouring out of church
as Rawdon and his friend passed down Saint James's Street and entered
into their Club.
The old bulks and habits, who ordinarily stand gaping and grinning
out of the great front window of the Club, had not arrived at their posts
as yet,-the newspaper-room was almost empty. One man was present
whom BRandon did not know; another to whom he owed a little score for
whist, and whom, in consequence, he did not care to meet ; a third was
reading the loyalty (a periodicul famous for its scandal and its attachment
to Church and King) sunday paper at the table, and, looking up at Crawled
with some interest, said, ` Crawled, l congratulate you.''
 What do you mean '' said the Colonel.
`It 's in the Olaerzer and the Royalty too,'' said Mr. Smith.
What '' Rawdon cried, turning very red. He thought that the affair
with Lord Sense was already in the public prints. Smith looked up
wondering and smiling at the agitation which the Colonel exhibited as he
took up the paper, and trembling, began to read.
Mr. Smith and MIr. Brown (the gentleman with whom Rawdon had the
outstanding whist account) had been talking about the Colonel just before
he came in.
It is come just in the nick of time,'' said Smith. `' I suppose Crawled
had not a shilling in the world.''
It 's a wind that blows everybody good,'' Mr. Brown said.  He can't
go away without paying me a pony he owes me.''
 What 's the salary '' asked Smith.

`` Some people say his brother is a very clever man.''  I always found

'..aren
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband,'' answered the other,
enigmatically, and went to read his papers.
Rawdon, for his part, read in the Royalty the following astonishing
paragraph:-
GovEoRsIP oOP CovETRY IsLAND.-H.M.S. ellowjaek, Come-
manner Jaunders, has brought letters and papers from Coventry Island.
H. E. Sir Thomas Liverscege had fallen a victim to the prevailing fever at
Swamptown. His loss is deeply felt in the flourishing colony. We hear
that the Governorship has been offered to Colonel Rawdon Crawled, C.B.,
a distinguished WVaterloo officer. We need not only men of ackowledged
bravery, but men of administrative talents to superintend the affairs of
our colonies; and we have no doubt that the gentleman selected by the
Colonial Office to fill the lamented vacaney which has occurred at Coventry
Island is admirably caleculated for the post which he is about to occupy.''
 Coventry Island where was it who had appointed him to the govern-
ment You must take me out as your secretary, old boy,'' Captain MIne-
mardol said laughing; and as Crawled and his friend sat wondering and
perplexed over the announcement, the Club waiter brought in to the
Colonel a card, on which the name of M. Wrench was engraved, who
begged to see Colonel Crawled.
The Colonel and his side-de-camp went out to meet the gentleman,
rightly conjecturing that he was an emissary of Lord Sense. ` How d'ye
do, Crawled I am glad to see you,'' said Mr. Wenham, with a bland smile,
and grasping Crawled's and with great cordiality.
e You come, I suppose, from --''
 Exactly,'' said Mr. When.
 Then this is my friend Captain Macmurdo of the Life Guards Green.''
Delighted to know Captain Maecmurdo, I'm sure,'' Mr. Wenhasm said,
and tendered another side and shake of the hand to the second, as he had
done to the principal. Man put out one finger, armed with a buckskin
glove, and made a very frigid bow to Mr. Wenham over his tight craat.
He was, perhaps, discontented at being put in communication with a
kind, and thought that Lord Sense should have sent him a Colonel at
the very least.
"`As Macmurdo sets for me, and knows what I mean,'' Crawled said, `1
had better retire and leave you together.''
Of course,'' said Maemurdo.
By no means, my dear Colonel,'' M, Wench said; ``' the interview
which I had the honour of requesting was with you personally, though the
company of Captain Mncmurlo cannot fail to be also most pleasing. In

agreeable results, very different from those which my friend Colonel Crawled
appears to anticipate.'

Damp, indeed,'' said Mr, Wenham, with the most agreeable smile;
still, look at the matter as a man of the world-as an honest man, and
see if you have not been in the wrong. you come home from a journey,
and find-what?-my Lord Sense supping at your house in Curzon
Street with Mr. Crawled. Is the circumstance strange or novel? Has
he not been a hundred times before in the same position Upon my
honour and word as a gentleman,'' (Mr. Wenham here put his hand
on his waistcoat with a parliamentary air), ``I declare I think that your
suspicions are monstrous and utterly unfounded, and that they injure an
honourable gentleman who has proved his good will towards you by a
thousand benefactions-and a most spotless and innocent lady.'
You don't mean to say that-that Craven's mistaken ?'' said MIr.
Mnemurdo.
`I believe that Mrs. Crawlsy is as innocent as my wife, Mrs. Wenham,''
Mr. Wench said, with great energy. ``I believe that, mialed by an
infernal jealousy, my friend here strikes a blow against not only an iufirm
and old man of high station, his constant friend and benefactor, but against
his wife, his own dearest honour, his son's future reputation, and his own
prospects in life.
:I will tell you what happened,'' Mr. Wenham continued with great
solemnity; ``I was sent for this morning by my Lord Street, and found
him in a pitiable state, as, I need hardly inform Colonel Crawled, any man
of age and infirmity would be after a personal conflict with a man of your
strength. I say to your face; it was a cruel advantage you took of
the strength, Colonel Crawled. It was not only the body of my noble
and excellent friend which was wounded-his heart, Sir, was bleeding.

A man whom he had loaded with benefits and regarded with affection, had
subjected him to the foulest indignity. What was this very appointment,
which appears in the journals of to-day, but a proof of his kindness to you
When I saw his Lordship this morning I found him in a state pitiable
indeed to see; and as anxious as you are to revenge the outrage come-
fitted upon him, by blood. You know he has given his proofs, I presume,
Colonel Crawled P''
hE has plenty of pluck,'' said the Colonel. e Nobody ever said he
hadn't.
 His first order to me was to write a letter of challenge, and to carry it
to Colonel Crawled. One or other of you,'' he said, ``must not survive
the outrage of last night.''
Crawled nodded. You 're coming to the point, Wenham,'' he said.
 I tried my utmost to calm Lord Sense. Good God1 Sir,'' I said,
how I regret that Mr. Wrench and myself had not accepted Mrs.
Crawled's invitation to sup with her1''
 She asked you to sup with her'' Captain Naemurdo said.
'After the Opera. Here's the note of invitation-stop-no, this is
another paper-I thought I had it, but it's of no consequence, and I
pledge you my word of honour as a gentleman to the fact. If we had come
-and it was only one of Mrs. Wenham's headache which prevented us
-she suffers under them a good deal, especially in the spring-if we had
come, and you had returned home, there would have been no quarrel, no
insult, no suspicion-and so it is positively because my poor wife has
headache that you are to bring death down upon two men of honour, and
plunge two of the most excellent and ancient families in the kingdom into
disgrace and sorrow,''
Mr, Maecmurdo looked at his principal with the air of a man profoundly
puzzled : and Rawson felt with a kind of rage that his prey was escaping
him. He did not believe a word of the story, and yet, how discredit or
disprove it?
Mr. Wenham continued with the same fluent oratory, which in his place
in parliament he had so often practised-`' I sat for an hour or more by
Lord Stone's bedside, beseeching, imploring Lord Sense to forego hi
intention of demnanding a meeting. I pointed out to him that the circle-
stances were after all swepicious-they were suspicious. I acknowledge it,
any man in your position might have been taken in-I said that a man
furious with jealousy is to all intents and purposes a madman, and should
be as such regarded-that a duel between you must lead to the disgrace of
all parties concerned-that a man of his Lordship's exalted station had no
right in these days, when the most atrocious revolutionary principles, and
the most dangerous levelling doctrines are preached among the vulgar, to
create a public scandal; and that, however innocent, the common people
would insist that he was guilty. In fine, I implored him not to send the
challenge,''
I don't believe one word of the whole story,'' said Rawlon, grinling
his teeth.  I believe it n anne lie, and that you 'are in it, Mr, What.
If the challenge don't come from him, by Jove it shall come from me.''
OF. WYenham turned deadly pale at this savage interruption of the
Colonel, and looked towards the door.
A MORE WITHOUT 1 HER0.

But he found a champion in Captain Macmurdo. That gentleman rose
up with an oath, and rebuked Rawdon for his language.  You put the
alTar into my hands, and you shall act as I think it, by Jove, and not as
you do. Iouhave no right to insult Mr. Wenham with this sort of language;
and dammy, Mr. Wenham, you deserve an apology. And as for a coal-
lenge to Lord Sense, you may get somebody else to carry it, I won't. If
my lord, after being thrshed, chooses to sit still, dnmmy let him. And
as for the affair with-with Mrs. Crawled, my belief is, there 's nothing
proved at all: that your wife 's innocent, as innocent and Mr. Wenham says
she is: and at any rate, that you would be a d-fool not to take the place
and hold your tongue.''
Captain Mnemurdo, you speak like a man of sense,'' Mr. Wenham
cried out, immensely relieved- I forget any words that Colonel Crawled
has used in the irritation of the moment.''
I thought you would,'' Rawdon said, with a sneer.
"`Shut your mouth, you old stooped,'' the Captain set good-naturedly.
Mr. name ain't a fighting man; and quite right, too.''
e This matter, in my belief,'' the Street emissary cried, ``ought to be
buried in the most profound oblivion. A word concerning it should never
pass these doors. I speak in the interest of my friend, as well as of
Colonel Crawled, who persists in considering me his enemy.''
I suppose Lord Sense won't talk about it very much,'' said Captain
Maemurdo; ` and i don't see why our side should. The affair ain't a
very pretty one, any way you take it ; and the less said about it the better.
It 's you are threshed, and not us; and if you are satisfied, why, I think,
we should be,''
Mr. Wenham took his hat, upon this, and Captain Macmurdo following
him to the door, shut it upon himself and Lord Stone's agent, leaving
Rawdon ehafing within. When the two were on the other side, Macmurdo
looked hard at the other ambassador, and with an expression of anything
but respect on his round jolly face.
 You don't stick at a trifle, Mr. Wenham,'' he said.
You flatter me, Captain Maemurdo,'' answered the other, with a smile.
`Upon my honour and conscience, now, Mrs. Crawled did ask us to sup
after the Opera.''
Of course; and More. Wenham had one of her headache. I say, I've
got a thousand-pound note here, which I will give you if you will give me
a receipt, please; and I will put the note up in an envelope for Lord
Sense. My man shan't fight him. But we had rather not take his
money.''
It was all a mistake,-all a mistake, my dear Sir,'' the other said,
with the utmost innocence of manner; and was bowed down the Club
steps by Captain Macmurdo, just as Sir Pitt Crawled ascended them.
There was a slight acquaintance between these to gentlemen; and the
Captain, going neck with the Baronet to the room where the latter's
brother was, told Sir Pitt, in confidence, that he had made the fair all
right between Lord Street and the Colonel.
Sir Pitt was well place, of course, at this intelligence; and contrast-
late his brother early upon the peaceful issue of the affair, making

appropriate moral remarks upon the evils of dwelling, and the satisfactory
nature of that sort of settlement of disputes.
And after this prefaee, he tried with all his eloquence to effect a reason-
relation between Rawdon and his wife. He reespitlated the statements
which Beck had made, pointed out the probabilities of their truth, and
asserted his own firm belief in her innocent.
But Rawdon would not hear of it,  8he has kept money concealed
from me these ten years,'' he said.  She swore, last night only, she had
none from Stone. She knew it was all up, directly I found it. If she 's
not guilty, Pitt, she 's as bad as guilty; and I 'll never see her again,--
never,'' HIs head sank down on his chest as he spoke the words; and he
looked quite broken and sad.
pOor old boy,'' Maemurdo said, shaking his head.
Rawdon Crawled resisted for some time the idea of taking the place
which had been procured for him by so odious a patron : and was also for
removing the boy from the school where Lord Stone's interest had passed
him. He was indeed, however, to acquiesce in these benefits by the
entreaties of his brother and Maemurdo: but mainly by the latter pointing
out to him what a fury Sense would be in, to think that his enemy's
fortune was made through his means.
When the Marquis of Stone came abroad after his accident, the Cold-
nail Secretary bowed up to him and congratulated himself and the Service
upon having made so excellent an appointment. These ongrstulations
were received with a degree of gratitude which may be imagined on the
part of Lord Street.
The secret of the rendered between him and Colonel Crawled was buried
in the profoundest oblivion, is Whom said; that is by the seconds and
the principal. But before that evening was over it was talked of at
fifty dinner-tables in Vanity Fair. Little Cackleby himself went to seen
evening parties, and told the story with comments and emendations at
each place. How Mrs. WFashington Whitrevelled in it1 The Bishops
of Eating was shocked beyond expression: the Bishop went and wrote his
name down in the visiting-book at Gaunt House that very day. Little
Southdown was sorry: so you may be sure was his sister Lady Jane, very
sorry. Lady Southdown wrote it off to her other daughter at the Cape of
Good Hope. It was town-talk for at least three days, and was only kept
out of the newspapers by the exertions of Mr. Wage, acting upon a hint
from Mr. Wenham.
The bailiffis and broken seized upon poor aggles in Curzon Street, and
the late fair tenant of that poor little mansion was in the meanwhile-
where Who cared W'ho asked after a day or two Was she guilty
or not: We all know how charitable the world is, and how the verdict
of Vanity Fair goes when there is a doubt. Some people said she had
gone to Naples in pursuit of Lord Listen; whilst others averred that his
Lordship quitted that city, and fled to Pnlermo on hearing of WReck's
arrival; some said she was living in Bierstadt, and had become a damned
d Manner to the queen of Bulgaria; some that she was at Boulogue;
au others, at n boarding-house at Cheltenham.

Rawdon made her a tolerable annuity; and we may be sure that she was
a woman who could make a little money go a great way, as the saying is.
He would have paid his debts on leaving england, could he have got any
Endurance Office to take his life ; but the climate of Coventry Island was
so bad that he could borrow no money on the strength of his nnnuity.
He remittel, however, to his brother punctually, and wrote to his little
boy regularly every mail. He kept Macmurdo in cigars; and sent over
quantities of shells, channel pepper, hot pickles, gave jelly, and colonial
produce to Lady Jane. He sent his brother home the Swamp TOngue
Gazette, in which the new Governor was praised with immense enthusiasm;

been reading during the day, and was greatly interested at the report the
boy gave of his own studies: pretending to understand little George when
he spoke regarding them. lIe made a hundred blunders, and showed his
ignorance many a time. It did not inerease the respect which the child
had for his senior. A quick brain and a better education elsewhere showed
the boy very soon that his grandsire was a adullam: and he began accord-
ingly to command him and to look down upon him; for his previous
education, humble and contracted as it had been, had made a much better
gentleman of George than any plans of his grandfather could make him.
He had been brought up by a kind, weak, and tender woman, who had no
pride about anything, but about him, and whose heart was so pure and
whose bearing was so meek and humble, that she could not but needs be a
true lady. She busied herself in gentle offices and quiet duties ; if she
never said brilliant things, she never spoke or thought uukind ones:
guileless and artless, loving and pure, indeed how could our poor little
Amelia be other than a real gentlewomanf
Young George looked over this soft and yielding nature; and the con
trust of its simplicity and delicacy with the coarse pomposity of the dull
old man with whom he next came in contact, made him lord over the
latter too. If he had been a Prince Royal he could not have been better
brought up to think well of himself.
Whilst his mother was yearning after him at home, and I do believe
eery hour of the day, and during most hours of the sad lonely nights,
thinking of him, this young gentleman had a number of pleasures and
consolations administered to him, which made him for his part bear the
separation from Amelia very easily. Little boys who cry when they are
going to school-cry because they are going to a very uncomfortable
place. It is only a very few who weep from sheer affection. When you
think that the eyes of your childhood dried at the sight of a piece of
gingerbread, and that a plum-cake was a compensation for the agony of
parting with your mamma and sisters; O my friend and brother, you need
not be too confident of your own fine feelings.
Well, then, Master George Borne had every comfort and luxury that
a wealthy and lavish old grandfather thought fit to provide. The coach-
man was instructed to purchase for him the handsomest pony which
could be bought for money; and on this George was taught to ride, first
at a riding-school, whence, after he had performed satisfactorily without
stirrups, and over the leaping-bar, he was conducted through the New
Road to Regent's Park, and then to Hyde Park, where he rode in state
with Martin the coachman behind him. Old Borne, who took matters
more easily in the City now, where he left his affairs to his junior pnrtners,
would often ride out with Miss O. in the same fashionable direction. As
lIttle George came cantering up with his landyfied air, and his heels down,
his grandfather would judge the lad's aunt, and say, ``Look, Miss O''
And he would laugh, and his face would grow red with pleasure, as he
nodded out of the window to the boy, as the groom saluted the carriage,
and the footman saluted Master George. Whereon his aunt, Mrs. Frederick
Bulloek, (whose chariot might daily be seen in the Ring, with bullocks or

proud as a lord,

Though he was scarcely eleven years of age, Mater George wore straps
and the most beautiful little boots like a man. He hal gilt spurs, and
gold-headed whip, and a fine pin in his handkerchief; and the nearest
little kid gloves which Lamb's Conduct Street could furnish. His- mother
had given him a couple of neck-cloths, and carefully hemmed and made
some little shirts for him; but when her Li came to see the widow, they
were replaced by much finer linen. He had little jewelled nations in the
lawn shirt-fronts. Her humble presents had been put aside-I believe
Miss Borne had given them to the coachman's boy. Amelia tried to
think she was pleased at the change. Indeed, she was happy and charmed
to see the boy looking so beautiful.
he had had a little black profile of him done for a shilling; and this
was hung up by the side of another portrait over her bed. One day the
boy came on his accustomed visit, galloping down the little street st
Brompton, and bringing, as usual, all the inhabitants to the windows to
admire his splendour, and with great eagerness, and a look of triumph in
his face, he pulled a case out of his great-coat-(it was a nasty white great-
coat, with a cape and a velvet collar)-pulled out a red moroeeo case,
which he gave her.
I bought it with my own one, Mamma,'' he said. I thought
you 'd like it.''
Amelia opened the case, and giving s little or of delighted sffetian,

feel the by and embrace him a hundred times. It was a miniatunre of
himself, very prettily done (though not half handsome enough, we may be
sure, the widow thought). His grandfather had wished to have a picture
of him by an artist whose works, exhibited in a shop-window, in South-
ampton Row, had caught the old gentleman's eyes; and George, who had
plenty of money, bethought him of asking the painter how much a copy
of the little portrait would cost, saying that he would pay for it out
of his own money, and that he wanted to give it to his mother. IDle
pleased painter expected the copy for a small price; and old Scorned
himself, when he heard of the incident, growled out his satisfaction, and
gave the boy twice as many sovereigns as he paid for the signature.
But what was the grandfather's pleasure compared to Amelia's exactly
That proof of the boy's affection charmed her so, that she thought no
child in the world was like her's for goodness. For long weeks after, the
thought of his love made her happy. She slept better with the picture
under her pillow; and how many many times did she kiss it, and weep
and pray over it A small kindness from those she loved made that
timid heart grateful. Sides her parting with George she had had no
such joy and consolation.
At his new home Master George ruled llke a lord: at dinner he invited
the ladies to drink wine with the utmost coolness, and took off his charm-
pine in a way which charmed his old grandfather. `Look at him,'' the
old man would say, judging his neighbour with a delighted purple face,
`did you ever see such a sharp Lord, Lord l he'llbe ordering a dressing-
case next, and razors to have with; I 'm blest if lie wont,''
The antics of the lad did not, however, delight. Mr. Borne's friends
so much as they please the old gentleman. It gave Mr. Justice Coffin
no pleasure to hear George cut into the conversation and spoil his stories.
Colonel Fogey was not interested in seeing the little boy half tipsy.
Mr. Serjeant Toffy's lady felt no particular gratitude when, with a twist of
his elbow, he tinted a glass of port-wine over her yellow satin, and laughed
at the disaster: nor was she better pleased, although old Borne was
highly delighted, when George ```opened '' her third boy (a young gentle-
man a year older ttisn George, and by chance love for the holidays from
Dr. Tiekleus's at long School) in Cruel Square. George's grandfather
gave the boy a cple of sowereigns fr that fit, and promised to reward
him further for every boy love his own she and age whom he wopped in
a similar manner. It is difficult to say what good the old man s in these
combat; head a vague notionthat quarrelling made boys hardy, and that
tyranny was useful assomplishment for them to learn. English youth
have been so devoted time out of mind, and we have hundreds of thou-
sands of apologise and admirers of injustice, misery, and brutality, as
perpetrated among children.
Flushed with praise and victory over Master Tory, George wished
naturally to pursue his conquests further, and one day as he was strutting
about in prodigiously dignified new clothes, near St. Paneras, and a young
baker's boy male sarcastic comments upon his appearance, the youthful
patricin pulled off his dandy jacket with great spirit, and giving it in
charge to the friend who accompanied him (Master Told, of Great Coram
506

Street, Trusser square, son of the junior partner of the house of Scorned and
Co.)-George tried to woo the little baker. But the chances of war were
unfaourable this time, and the little baker wopped George: who came
home with a rueful black eye and all his fine shirt filled dibbled with the
claret drawn from his own little nose. He told his grandfather that he
had been in combat with a giant; and frightened his poor mother at
Brompton with long, and by no means attentive, accounts of the battle.
This young Told, of Coram Street, Trusser Square, was Master George's
great friend and admirer. They both had a taste for painting theatrical
characters ; for hard bake and rspbeny parts; for sliding and skating in the
event'a Park and the Serpentine, when the weather permitted; for going
to the play, whither they were often conducted, by Mr. Borne's orders,
by Rowson, Master George's appointed body-servant; with whom they
sat in great comfort in the pit.

In the company of this gentleman they visited all the principal thetres
of the metropolis-knew the names of all the actors from Drury Lane t

family and their youthful friends, with Wet's famous characters, on their
pasteboard theatre. Rowson, the footman, who was of a generous dis-
position, would not unfrequently, when in case, treat his young master to
oysters after the play, and to a glass of rum-shrub for a night-cap. We
may be pretty certain that Mr. Rowson profited in his turn, by his young
master's liherality and gratitude for the pleasures to which the footman
induced him.
A famous tailor from the West End of the town,-Mr. Borne would
have none of your City or Forlorn bunglers he said, for the boy (though
a City tailor was good enough for him),-was summoned to ornament little
George's person, and was told to spare no expense in so doing. So, Mr.
Woolsey of Conduct-street, gave a loose to his imagination, and sent the
chill home fancy trousers, fancy waistcoats, and fancy jackets enough
to furnish a school of little ladies. George hal little white wistcoats
for evening parties and little cut velvet waistcoats for dinners, and a dear
little darling shawl dressing-gown, for all the world like a little man.
He dressed for dinner every day, ``like a regular West End Swell,'' as his
grandfather remarked: one of the domestic was affected to his especial
service, attended him at his toilette, answered his bell, and brought him
his letters always on a silver tray.
George, after breakfast, would sit in the arm-chair in the dining-room,
and read the ` Morning Post,'' just like a grown-up man. :` How he du
dam and swear,'' the servants would cry, delighted at his precocity. Those
who remembered the Captain his father, declared Master George was his
P every inch of him. He made the house lively by his activity, lis
imperiousness, his scolding, and his good-nature.
George's education was confided to a neighbouring scholar and private
pelgogue who ` prepared young noblemen and gentlemen for the Univer-
cities, the senate, and the learned prolfcssions: whose system did not
embrace the degrading corporal severities, still practised at the ancient
places of education, and in whose family the pupils would find the
elegancies of refined society and the confidence and affection of a home.''
It was in this way that the Reverend Lawrence Veil of Hart Street,
Bloomsbury, and domestic Chaplain to the Earl of Bareacres, strove with
Mrs. eat his wife to entire pupils.
By thus advertising and pushing sedulously, the domestic Chaplain and
his Lady generally succeeded in having one or two scholars by them: who
paid a high figure: and were thought to be in uncommonly comfortable
quarters. There was a large West Indian, whom nobody came to see,
with a mahogany complexion, a woolly hed, and an exceedingly dignified
appearance: there was another hulking boy of three-and-twenty whose
education had been neglected, and whom Mr. and Mrs. Veal were
to introduce into the polite world: there were two sons of Colonel
Bangles of the East India Company's Service : these four sat down to
dinner at Mrs. Veal's genteel board, when George was introduced to her
establishment.
George was, like some dozen other pupils, only a day boy: he arrived
in the morning under the guardianship of his friend Mr, Rowaon, and if it

was fine, would ride away in the afternoon on his pony, followed by the
groom. The wealth of his grandfather was reported in the school to be
prodigious. The Re. Mr. Veal used to compliment George upon it
personally, warning him that he was destined for a high station; that it
became him to prepare, by security and docility in youth, for the lofty
duties to which he would be called in mature age; that obedience in the
child was the best preparation for command in the man; and that he
therefore begged George would not bring toffy into the school, and ruin
the health of the Masters Bangles, who had everything they wanted at the
elegnt an abundant table of Mrs. Veal.
With respect to learning, `' the Curriculum,'' as Mr. Veal loved to call
it, was of prodigious extent: and the young gentlemen in Hart Street
might learn a something of every known science. The Red. Mr. Veal had
an order, an electrifying machine, a turning late, a theatre (in the wash-
house), a clerical apnaratns, and, what he called a select library of all the
works of the best authors of ancient and modern times and languages.
lIe took the boys to the British Museum, and descended upon the antique-
ties and the specimens of natural history there, so that sudienees would
gather round him as he spoke, and all Bloomsbury highly admired him as
a prodigiously well informed man. And whenever he spoke (which he did
almost always), he took care to produce the very finest and longest words
of which the vocabulary gave him the use; rightly judging, that it was as
cheap to employ a handsome, large, and sonorous epithet, as to use a little
tiny one.
Thus he would say to George in school, '`I observed on my return home
from taking the indulgence of an evening's scientific conversation with my
excellent friend Doctor Bulders-a true areheologian, gentlemen, a true
archaeologian-that the windows of your repeated grandfather's almost
princely mansion in Trusses square were illuminated as if for the purposes
of festivity. Am lI right in my conjecture, that Mr. Borne entertained a
society of chosen spirits round his impetuous board last night ''
Little George, who had considerable humour, and used to mimie Mr,
Veal to his face with great spirit and dexterity, would reply, that Mr, .
was quite correct in his surmise.
hen those friends who had the honour of partaking of MIr. Borne's
hospitality, gentlemen, had no reason, I will lay any water, to complain
of their repast. I myself have been more than once so favoured. (By the
way, Master Borne, you came a little late this morning, and have been
a defaulter in this respect more than one). I myself, I say, gentlemen,
humble as i am, have been found not unworthy to share Mr. Borne's
elegant hospitality. And though I have feasted with the great and noble
of the world-for I presume that I may call my excellent friend and patron,
the Right Honourable George Earl of Bareaeres, as one of the number-yet
I assure you that the board of the British merchant was to the full ass
riehly served, and his reception as gratifying and noble. Mr. Black,
Sir, we will resume, if you please, that passage of Eutropius, which was
interrupted by the late arrival of Master Borne.'''
To this great man George's education was for some time entrusted.
A NOY WITHOUT A HERO.
509
Amelia was bewildered by his phrases, but thought him a prodigal of
learning. `That poor widow made friends with Mr. Vcal, for reasons of
her own. She liked to be in the house, and see George coming to school
there. sHe liked to he asked to Me. Veal'as cosersaeioni, which took
place once a month (as you were informed on pink cards, with TaKEN
engraved on them), and where the Professor welcomed his pupils and their
friends to weak tea and scientific conversation. Poor little Aelia never
kissed one of these entertainment, and thought them delicious so long as
she might have George sitting by her. And she would walk from bBromptou
in any weather, and embrace Mrs. Vocal with tearful gratitude for the
delightful evening she had passed, when, the company having retired and
George gone off with MIr. Rowson his attendant, poor mrs. Shone put
on her cloaks and her shawls preparatory to walking home.
As for the lamning which George climbed under this voluble master of
a hundred acienees, to judge from the weekly reports which the lad took
home to his grandfather, his progress was remarkable. The names of a
score or more of desirable branches of knowledge were printed on a table,
and the pupil's progress in each was marked by the professor. In Greek
George was pronounced artist, in Latin optimus, in FRench trees in,
and so forth; and everybody had prizes for everything at the end of the
year. Even Mr. wartz, the woolly-headed young gentleman, and half-
brother to the Honourable Mrs. Me Full, and Mr. Black, the neglected
young pupil of threads-twenty from the agricultural distriols, and that
idle young seapegraoe of a Master Told before mentioned, received little
eighteen-penny hooks, with '' Athene'' engraved in them, and a pompous
Latin inscription from the Professor to his young friends.
The family of this Master Told were hangers-on of the house of
Borne. The old gentleman had advanced Told from being a clerk to
be s junior partner in his establishment.
Mr. Borne was the godfather of young aster Told (who in susan-
quent life wrote Mr. Become Told on his cards, and became a man of
decided fashion) while Miss Borne had accompanied Miss Maria Told
to the font, and gave her proetegee a prayer-book, a collection of trssts, a
volume of very low church poetry, or some such movement of her goodness
every year. Miss O. drove the Odds out in her carriage now and then:
when they were all her footman, in large plush small and waistcoat,
brought jellies and delicacies from Trusser Square to Coram Street. Coram
Street trembled and looked up to sell Square indeed; and Mrs. Told,
who had a pretty hand at cutting out paper trimings for branches of
mutton, and could make flowers, ducks, &c., out of turnips and carrots in
a very creditable manner, would go to ``the Square,'' as it was called, and
aghast in the preparations incident to a great dinner, without even so much
as thinking of sitting down to the banquet. If any guest failed at the
eleventh hour, Told was asked to dine. Mrs. Told and Maria came across
in the evening, slipped in with a muffled knock, and were in the drawing-
rooin by the time Miss Scorned and the ladies under her convoy reached
that apartment; and ready to fire off lusts and sing until the gentlemen
came up. Poor Maria Told; poor young lady How she had to work

in public in the Square
Thus it seemed to be decreed by fate, that George was to domineer over
everybody with whom he came in contact, and that friends, relatives, and
domestic were all to bow the knee before the little fellow. It must be
owned that he accommodated himself very willingly to this arrangement.
Most people do so. And George liked to play the part of master, and
perhaps had a natural aptitude for it.
In Trusses Square everybody is afraid of M. Scorned, and Mr. Borne
was afraid of George. The boy's dashing manners, and off-hand rattle
about books and learning, his likeness to his father, (dead unreconciled in
Brussels yonder), awed the old gentleman, and give the young boy the
mastery. The old man would start at some hereditary feature or tone
unconsciously used by the little lad, and fancy that George's father was
again before him. He tried by indulgence to the grandson to make up for
harshness to the elder George. People were surprised at his gentleness to
these He rested and sees at Miss Home as usual : and would
smile when George came down late for breakfast.
Miss Borne, George's aunt, was a faded old spinster, broken down
by more than forty years of dulness and coarse usage. It was easy for a
lad of spirit to master her. And whenever George wanted anything from
her, from the jam-pots in her cupboards, to the cracked and dry old colours
in her paint-box (the old paint-box which she had had when she was a
pupil of Mr. See, and was still almost young and blooming), George
took possession of the object of his desire, which obtained, he took no
further notice of his aunt.
For his friends and cronies, he had a pompons old schoolmaster, who
fettered him, and a toad, his senior, whom he could thrash. It was
dear Mrs. Told's delight to leave him with her youngest daughter, Rose
Jemima, a darling child of eight years old. The little pir looked so
well together, she would say (but not to the folks in 'the Square,' we
may be sure),- Who knows what might happen Don't they make a
pretty little couple'' the fond mother thought.
The broken-spirited, old, maternal grandfather was likewise subject to
the little tyrant. He could not help respecting a lad who had such fine
clothes, and rode with a groom behind him. George, on his side, was in
the constant habit of hearing course abuse and vulgar satire lived at
John Sedley, by his pitiless old enemy, Mr. Borne. Borne used to
call the other the old pauper, the old coal-man, the old bankupt, and by
many other such names of brutal contumely. How was little George to
respect a man so prostrate  few months after he was with his paternal
grandfather, Mrs. Sedley died. There had been little love between her and
the child. He did not care to show much grief. He came down to visit
his mother in a fine new suit of mourning, and was very angry that he
could not go to a play upon which he had set his heart.
The illness of that old lady had been the occupation and perhaps the
safeguard of Hamlin. What do men know about women's martyrdom?

511
pains which are meekly borne by many women, Ceaseless slavery meeting
with no reward; constant gentleness and kindness met by cruelty as con-
stand; love, labour, patience, watchfulness, without even so much as the
acknowledgment of a good word; all this, how many of them have to
bear in quiet, and appear abroad with cheerful faces as if they felt
nothing. Tender slaves that they are, they must needs be hypocrisy and
we.
From her chair Amelia's mother had taken to her bed, which she had
never left: and from which Mrs. Scorned herself was never absent except
when she in to see George. The old lady grudged her even those rare
visits: she, who had been a kind, smiling, good-natured mother once,
in the days of her prosperity, but whom poverty and infirmities had
broken down. Her illness or estrangement did not affect Amelia. They
rather enabled her to support the other enalamity under which she was sun-
fearing, and from the thoughts of which she was kept by the ceaseless call
of the invalid. Amelia bore her harshness quite gently: smoothed the
uneasy pillow; was always ready with a soft answer to the watchful, queru-
loud voice; soothed the sufferer with words of hope, such as her pious
simple heart could best feel and utter, and closed the eyes that had once
looked so tenderly upon her.
Then all her time and tenderness were devoted to the consolation and
comfort of the bereaved old father, who was stunned by the blow which
had befallen him, and took utterly alone in the world. His wife, his
honour, his fortune, everything he loved best had fallen away from him.
There was only Amelia to stand by and support with her gentle arms the
tottering, heart-broken, old man. We are not going to write the history:
it would be too dreary and stupid. I can see Vanity Fair yawning her
it: d'valence.
One day as the young gentlemen were assembled in the study at the
Red. Mr. Veil's, and the domestic chaplain to the Right Honourable the
Earl of Barencres was spouting away as usual-a smart carriage drove
up to the door decorated with the statue of Athene, and two gentlemen
stepped out. The young Masters Bangles rushed to the window, with a
vague notion that their father might have arrived from Bombasy. The
great hulking scholar of three-and-twenty, who was crying secretly over a
passage of Eutropius, flattened his neglected nose against the panes, and
looked at the drag, as the anguish de place sprang from the box and let out
the persons in the carriage.
It 's as at one and a thin one,'' Mr. Black said, as a thundering knock
came to the door.
Everybody was interested, from the domestic chplain himself, who
hoped he saw the fathers of some future pupils, down to Master George,
glad of any pretext for lying lis book down.
The boy in the shabby livery, with the faded copper-buttons, who
always thrust himself into the tight coat to open the door, come into the
study and said,  Two gentlemen want to see Master Osbomne.'' Th

his eyes brightened. ' I don't know the other,'' he said, ``but I should

of the man who had most injurel
and insulted him. The successful
man of the world cursed the old
pepper, and relieved him from time
to time. As he furnished George
with money for his mother, he gave
the boy to understand by hints,
delivered in his brutal, coarse way,
that George's maternal grandfather
was but a wretched old bunkrupt
and dependent, and that John See-
let might thank the man to whom
he already owed ever so much
money, for the aid which his gone-
rosity now chose to administer.
George carried the pompous supplies to his mother and the shattered
old widower whom it was now the main business of her life to tend and
comfort. The little fellow patronised the feeble and disappointed old man.
It may have shown a want of `' proper pride'' in Amelia that she
chose to accept these money beuefits at the hands of her father's enemy.
But proper pride and this poor lady had never had much aequaiutancee
together. A disposition naturally simple and demanding protection; a
long course of poverty and. humility, of daily privations, and hard words,
of kind offices and no returns, had been her lot ever since womanhood
almost, or since her luckless marriage with George Borne. You who
see your betters, bearing up under this shame every day, meekly suffering
under the lights of fortune, gentle and unpitied, poor, and rather despised
for their poverty, do you ever step down from your prosperity and was

odious and now.  There must he classes-there must be rich and poor,''
Dives says, smacking his claret- (it is well if he even sends the broken meat
out to Lazarus sitting under the window.) Very true; but think how
mysterious and often unaccountable it is-that lottery of life which gives
to this man the purple and fine linen, and sends to the other rags for
garments and dogs for comfortcrs.
So I must own, tent without much repining, on the contrary with some-
thing akin to gratitude, Amelia took the crumbs that her father-in-law let
drop now and then and with them fed her own parent. Directly she
understood it to be her duty, it was this young woman's nature (ladies, she
is but thirty still, and we choose to call her a young woman even at that
age)-it was, I by, her nature to sacrifice herself and to fling all that she
lat at the feet of the beloved object. During what long thankless nights
lad she worked out her fingers for little George whilst ut hoe with her;
what buffets, scorns, privations, poverties had she endured for father and
mother And in the midst of all these solitary resignation und unseen
sacrifices, she did not respect herself any more than the world respected
her; but I believe thought in her heart that she was a poor-spirited,
despicable little creature, whose luck in life was only too good for her
merits. O you poor women O you poor secret martyrs and victims,
whose life is a torture, who are stretched on sacks in your bedrooms, and
who lay your heads down on the block daily at the drawing-room tall
every an who watches your pains, or peers into those dark places where
the torture is administered to you, must pity you-and-and thank God
that he has a beard. I recollect seeing, years ago, at the prison for idiots
and then at Picture, near pAris, a poor wretch bent down under the
bondage of his imprisonment and his personal infirmity, to whom one of
her pity gave a halfpennyworth of snuff in a corner or ' screw'' of paper
The kindness was too much for the poor epileptic creature. HE cried
in an anguish of delight and gratitude: if anybody gave you and me a
thousand a-year, or saved our lives, we could not be so affected. And so,
if you properly tyrannise over a woman, you will find a half 'orth of
kindness act upon her, and bring tears into her eyes, as though you were
an angel benefiting her.
Some such books as these were the best which Fortune allotted to poor
little Amelia. Her life, begun not unprosperously, had come down to
this-to a mean prison and a long, ignoble bondage. Little George
visited her captivity sometimes, and consoled it with feeble gleams of
encouragement. lussell Square was the boundary of her prison: slc
might walk thither occasionally, but was always back to sleep in her cell
at night; to perform cheerless duties ; to watch by thnnkless sick-beds;
to suffer the harassment and tyranny of querulous disappointed old age.
HOw many thousands of people are there, women for the most part, who
are doomed to endure this long slavery ?-who are hospital-nurses without
wages,-sisters of Charity, if you like, without the romance and the
sentiment of sacrifice,--wo strike, t. th, and suffer. tired: and

with those who are less lucky, if not more deserving. Think, what right

success may be a glance, whose rank may be an ancestor's accident, whose
prosperity is very likely a satire.
They buried melia's mother at the church-yard at Brompton; upon
just sch a rainy, dark day, as Amelia recollected when first she had been
there to marry George. Her little boy sat by her side in pompous new
tables. She remembered the old pew-woman and clerk. Her thoughts
were away in other times as the parson read. But that she held George's
hand in her own, perhaps she would have liked to change places with..
Then, as usual, she felt ashamed of her selfish thoughts, and prayed
inwardly to be strengthened to do her duty.
So she determined with all her might and strength to try and make her
old father happy. Sheslaved, toiled, patched and mended, sang and played
backgammon, rend out the newspaper, cookel dishes for old Sedley,
walked him out sedulously into kensington Gardens or the Brompton
Lanes, listened to his stories with untiing smiles and affectionate
hypaocrisy, or late musing by lis side and communing with her own
thoughts and reminiscences, as the old man, feeble and querulous, shunned
himself on the garden benches and prattled about his wrongs or his
sorrows. What sad, unsatisfactory thoughts those of the widow were
The children running up and down the slopes and broad paths in the
gardens, reminded her of George who was taken from her; the first
George was taken from her: her selfish, guilty love, in both instances,
hal been rebuke and bitterly chastised. She strove to think it was right
that she should be so punished. She was such a miserable wicked sinner.
She was quite alone in the world.
I know that the account of this kind of solitary imprisonment is
insufferably tedious, unless there is some cheerful or humorous incident
to enliven it,-a tender gaoler, for instance, or a haggish commandant of
the fortress, or a mouse to come out and play about Nature's bear and
whiskers, or n subterranean passage under the castle, dug by Trenck with
his nails and a toothpick: the historian has no such enlivening incident
to related in the narrative of Amelin's captivity. Fancy her, if you please,
during this period, very sad, but always ready to smile when spoken to; in
a very mean, poor, not to say vulgar position of life; singing songs, making
puddings, playing cards, mending stockings, for her old father's benefit.
To, never mind, whether she be a heroine or no; or you and I, however
old, sceolding, and bankrupt;-may we have in our last days a kind soft
shoulder on which to lean, and a gentle hand to soothe our gouty old
pillows.
All Shelley grew very fond of his daughter after his wife's death; and
Amelia had her consolation in doing her duty by the old man.
But we are not going to leave these two people long in such a low and
ungenteel station of life. better days, as far as worldly prosperity went,
were in store for both. Perhaps the ingenious reader has guessed who
was the stout gentleman who called upon George at his school in company

with our old friend Major Doing. It was another old acquaintance
returned to England, and at a time when his presence was likely to be of
great comfort to his relatives there.
Msjor Doing having easily succeeded in getting leave from his good-
natured commandant to proceed to Madame, and thence probably to Europe,
on urgent private affairs, never ceased travelling night and day until he
reached his journey's end, and had directed his march with such celerity,
that he arrived nt Dreams in a high fever. His servants who accompanied
him, brought him to the house of the friend with whom he had resolved to
stay until his departure for Europe in a state of delirium; and it was
thought for my many days that he would never travel further than the
burying-ground of the church of St. George's, where the troops should
fire n along over his grave, and where many a gallant officer lips far away
from his home.
Here is the poor fellow lay tossing in his fever, the people who watched
him might have heard him raving about Amelin. The idea that he should
never see her again depressed him in his lucid hours. In thought his
last day was come; and he made his solemn preparations for departure:
setting his affairs in this world in order, and leaving the little property of
which he was possessed to those whom he most desired to benefit. The
friend in whose house he was located witnessed his testament. le desire
to be buried with a little brown hair-chain which he wore round his neck,
and which, if the truly must be known, he had got from Amclia's maid at
Brussels, when the young widow's hair was cut of, during the fever which
prostrate her after the death of George Borne on the plate of Mount
St. Woman.
He recovered, rallied, relapsed again, having undergone such a process
of blood-letting and closely as showed the strength of his original cousin-

Rnmchunder, lEast Indignant, Captain Bragg, from Calcutta touching at
MInds; and so went and prostrate, that his friend who had tended him
through his illness, prophesied that the honest Mnjor would never survive
the voyage, and that he would pass some morning, shrouded in flag and
mocked, over the ship's side, and carrying down to the sea with him,
the relic that he wore at his heart. but whether it was the sea air, or
the hope which sprang up in it afresh, from the day that the ship spread
her canvas and stood out of the bonds towards me, our friend began
to mend, and he was quite well (though as gaunt as a greyhound) before
they reached the Cape. `` Kick will be disappointed of' his majority
this time,'' he said with a smile ``he will expect to find himself gazetted
by the time the regiment reaches some.'' For it must be praised

under the guardianship of Glorvinn. : I think Miss O'Down would have
done for me,'' he said, laughingly, to a fellow-passenger, ` if we had had
her on board, and when she had sunk me, she would have fallen upon you,
depend upon it, and carried you in as a prize to Southampton, Joy, my
boy.''
For indeed it was no other than our stout friend who was also a pas-
singer on board the Ramchunder. He had passed ten years in Being.-
Constant dinners, tidings, pale ale and claret, the prodigious labours of
butchery, and the refreshment of brandy-pane which he was forced to
take there, had their effect upon Waterloo Sedley. A voyage to Europe
was pronounced necessary for him-mud having served his full time in
Indin, and had fine appointmeuts which had enabled him to lay by a con-
miserable sum of money, he was free to come home and stay with a good
pension, or to return and resume that rank in his service to which his
seniority and his vast talents entitled him.
He was rather thinner than when we last saw him, but had gained in
majesty and solemnity of demeanour. He had resumed the moustnchios
to which his services at Waterloo entitlel him, and staggered about on
deck in a magnificent velvet cap with a gold band, nd a profuse for-
mention of pins and jewellery about his person. DIe took breakfast in
his cabin, and dressed as solemnly to appear on the quarter-deck, as if he
was going to turn out for Bond Street, or the Course at Calcutta. He
brought a nature servant with him, who was his mulet and pipe-bearer;
and who wore the Hedley rest in silver on his turban. That oriental
menial had a wretched life under the tyranny of Joy Sedley. Joy was as
vain of his person as a woman, and took as long a time at his toilette as
any fading beauty. The youngsters among the passengers, young Chambers
of the 150th, and poor little licketts, coming home after his third fever,
used to draw out Sedley at the ruddy-table, and make him tell prodigious
stories about himself nnl his exploits against tigers and Napoleon. He
was great when he visited the Emperor's tomb at Lowood, when to these
gentlemen and the young officers of the ship, Mnjor Doing not being by, he
described the whole Battle of Waterloo, and all but announced that Nape-
lean never would have gone to Saint IIelena at all but for him, Joy Sedley.
After leaving St. Helen he became very generous, disposing of a great
quantity of ship stores, claret, preserved meats, and great asks packed
with soda-water, brought out for his private expectation. There were no
ladies on board; the Mnjor give the pas of precedency to the civility,
so that he was the first dignity at table; and treated by Captain
Bragg, and the officers of the Ramchunler, with the respect which his
rank warranted. DIe disappeared rather in a panic during a two-days'
gale, in which he had the worthless of his cabin battened down; and
remained in his cot reading the Washerwoman of Finally Common, left
on board the Ramchunder by the Right Honourable the Lady Emily
Horblower, wife of the Re. Silas Hornblower, then on their passage out
to the Cape, where the Reverend gentleman was a missionary ; but, for
common reading, he had brought a stock of novels and plays which he
went to the rest of the ship, and rendered himself agreeable to all by
his kindness and condescension.

In these conersations it was wonderful with what perseverance and
ingenuity Major Doing would usage to bring the talk round to the
subject of Amelia and her little boy. Job, a little test about his father'
misfortunes and unceremonious applications to him, was soothed down by
the Mayor, who pointed out the elder's ill fortunes and old age. He
would not perhaps like to live with the old couple: whose ways and
hours might not agree with those of a younger man, accustomed to different

society, (Joy bowed ant this compliment) : but, the Minor pointed out, how
advantageous it would be for Joy Sedley to have a house of his own in
London, and not a mere bachelor's establishment as before; how his sister
Amelia would be the very person to preside over it; how clegant, how
gentle she was, and of what refined good manners. He counted stories
of the success which Mrs. George Borne had had in former days at
Brussels, and in London, where she was much admired by people of very
great fashion: and he then hinted how becoming it would be for Joy to
send George to a good school and make a man of him; for his mother
and her parents would be sure to spoil him. In a word this artful Major
made the civility promise to take charge of Amelia and her unprotected
child. He did not know as yet what events had happened in the little
Seller family; and how death had removed the mother, and riches had
carried off George from Amelia. But the fact is that every day and
always, this love-smitten and middle-aged gentleman was thinking about
Mrs. Osborue, and his whole heart was bent upon doing her good. He
coaxed, wheelled, cnjoled, nd complimented Joy 5edley with a persever-
once and cordiality of which he was not aware himself, very likely : but
some men who have unmarried sisters or daughters even, may remember
how uncominonly agreeable gentlemen are to the male relations when they
are courting the females; and perhaps this rogue of n Doing was urged
by a similar hypocrisy.
The truth is, when Mnjor Doing me on board the Ramchunder,
very sick, and for the three days she lay in the MIadras Roads, he did not
begin to rally, nor did even the appearance and recognition of his old
acquaintance, MIr. Surely, on board such cheer him, until after a corner-
nation which they had one day, as the Mayor was laid languidly on the
deck. He said then he thought he was doomed; he had left a little
something to lis poison in his will; and he trusted Mrs. Borne would
remember him kindly, and be happy in the marriage she was about to
make. ` Married not the least,'' Joy answered; `' he had heard From
her; she made no mention of the marriage, and by the way, it was curious,
she wrote to say that MIajor Doing was going to be married, and hoped
that he would be happy,'' What were the dates of Sedley's letters from
Europe: 1he civility fetched them. hey were two months' later than
the Mnjor's; and the ship's surgcon congratulated himself upon the treat-
ment adopted by him towards his new patient, who had been consigned
to ship-board by the Marks practitioner with very small hopes indeed;
for, from the day, the very day that he changed the draught, Moor bobbin
began to mend. And thus it was that deserving oflicer, Captain Nirk,
was disappointed of his majority.

amiable, that even Captain bragg, who thought there was nothing in his
passenger, and considered he was a poor-spirited feller nt first, was con-

But s calm taking place when the Ramchunder was within ten days' sail

excited state when the plot came on board. Good God, how his heart

Sedley descended into the welcome
shore-boat which was to take them
from the ship, the whole crew,
men and officers, the great Cap-
pain lang himself leading off,
gave three cheers for MIajor Do-
bin, who blushed very much, and
tucked his head in token of thanks.
Joy who very likely thought the
cheers were for himself, took off
his gold-laced cap and waved it
najestically to his friends, and
they were pulled to shore and
filled with great dignity at the
pier, whence they proceeded to the

some days there, yet Doing began to talk about a post-chaise instantly,
and was no sooner at Southampton than he wished to be on the road to
London. Joy, however, would not hear of moving that evening. Why
was he to pass night in a post-chaise instead of a great large undulating
downy featherbed which was there ready to replace the horrid littlenarrow
crib in which the portly Being gentleman had been confined during the
voyage? He could not think of moving till his boggage was cleared, or
of travelling until he could do so with his chill. So the Major was
forced to wait over that night, and dispatched a letter to his family an-
unerring his arrival; entreating from Job a promise to write to his own

friends. Joy promise, but didn't keep his promise. The Captain, the
surgeon, and one or two passengers came and dined with our two gentle-
men at the inn: Joy exerting himself in a impetuous way in ordering
the dinner: and promising to go to town the next day with the Major.
The landlord said it did his eyes good to see Mr. Sedley take off his first
pint of porter. If I had time and dared to enter into digressions, I would
write a chapter about that first pint of porter drunk upon English ground.
Ah, how good it is It is worth while to leave home for a year, just to
enjoy that one draught.
MIajor Doing made his appearance the next morning very neatly shaved
and dressed, according to his wont. Indeed, it was so early in the
morning, that nobody was up in the house except that wonderful Boots of
an inn who never seems to want sleep: and the Mnjor could hear the
snores of the various inmates of the house roaring through the corridors
as he creaked about in those dim passages. Then the sleepless bOots
went shirking round from door to door, gathering up at each the Bluchers,
Wellingtons, Oxonians, which stood outside. Then Joy's native servant
rose and began to get ready his master's ponderous dressing apparatus,
and prepare his look: then the maid servants got up, and meeting the
dark man in the passages shrieked and mistook him for the devil. DIe
and sObbing stumbled over their pails in the passages as they were
sceouring the weeks of the Royal George. When the first unshormn waiter
appeared and unbarred the door of the inn, the Major thought that the
time for departure was arrived, and ordered s post-chaise to be fetched
instantly, that they might set off.
DIe then directed his steps to MIr. Sedley's room, and opened the
curtains of the great large family bed wherein Mr. Joy was snoring. `Come,
up: Sedley,'' the Major said, ' it's time to be off'; the claise will be at
lie door in half an hour.''
Joy growled from under the counterpane to know what the time was;
but when he at last extorted from the blushing Major (who never told fibs,
however much they might be to his advantage) what was the real hour of
the morning, he broke out into a volley of bad language, which we will
not repeat here, but by which he gave Doing to understand that he
would jeopardy his soul if he got up at that moment, the the Major
might go and be hanged, that he would not travel with Dozing, and tilt
it was most uukind and ungentlemanlike to disturb a man out of his sleep
in that way: on which the discomfited Major was obliged to retreat,
leaving Joy to resume his interrupted slumbers.
1he chaise came up presently, and the Mnjor would wait no longer.
If he had been an English noblemuan travelling on a pleasure tour; or
newspaper courier, bearing dispatches, (government messages are generally
carried much more quietly) he could not have travelled more quickly. The
post boys wondered at the faces he flung amongst them. Low happy
and green the country looked and the chaise wlirled rapidly from mile-
stone to mile-stone, through neat country towns where Landlord came
out to welcome him with smiles and bows; by pretty rod-side inns,
where the signs hung on the elms, and horses and waggoners were
drinking under the chequered shadow of the trees; by old hills and

Slaughter's, whither he drove faithfully. Long years had passed since ho
no it last, since he and George, as young men, had enjoyed many a feast,
and held many a revel there. He had now passed into the stage of old-
fellows-fool. His hair was grizzled, and many a passion and feeling of
his youth had grown grey in that interval. There, however, stood the old
waiter at the door in the same greasy black suit, with the sue double chin
and fancied face, with the same huge bunch of sends at his for, rattling his
money in his pockets us before, and receiving the Major as if he had gone
away only a week ago. ` Put the Mayor's things in twenty-street, that's
his room,'' John said, exhibiting not the least surprise. ` almost town for

morceen bed, and the shabby carpet, i thought more dingy, and all the old
black furniture covered with faded clintz, just as the Mnjor recollected
them in his youth.
He remembered George pacing up and down the room, and biting his
nails, and swearing that the Goveror must come round, and that if he
lion't, he lin't care a straw, on the day before he was married. lIe could

as he sureyed them in the dreary little toilet-glass on the dressing
table.
1'm glad old John did't forget me,'' he thought.  She'll know me,
too, I hope.'' And he sallied out of the inn, bending his steps once more
in the direction of Brompton,
Every minute incident of his last meeting with Amelia was present to
the constant man's mind as he walked towards her house. The arch and
the Achilles statue were up since he had last been in Piccadilly; a hundred
changes had occurred which his eye and mind vaguely noted. He began
to tremble as he walked up the lane from Brompton, that well remembered
lane lending to the street where she lived. Was she going to be married
or not ? If he were to meet her with the little boy-Good God, what
should he do% He saw a woman coming to him with a child of five years
old-was that she DIe began to slake at the mere possibility. When
he came up to the row of houses, at last, where she lived, and to the gate,
he caught hold of it and paused. He might have heard the thumping of
his own heart. `'May God Almighty bless her, whatever has happened,''
he thought to himself. Pshal she may be gone from here,'' he said,
and went in through the gate.
The window of the parlour which she used to occupy was open,
and there were no inmates in the room. The Msjor thought he
recognised the piano though, with the picture over it, as it used to be
in former days, and his perturbations were renewed. Mr. Clasp's brass
plate was still on the door; at the knocker of which Doing performed a

too-said ``Lord bless me-it 's Mujor Being,'' She held out both her
hands shaking-`` Don't you remember me?'' she said,  `` I used to call
you Mujor Sugarplums. On which, and I believe it was for the first time
that he ever so conducted himself in his life, the Major took the girl in his
arms and kissed her. She began to laugh and cry hysterically, and calling
out '' In, Pale'' with all her voice, brought up those worthy people, who
had already been surveying the Miajor from the casement of the ornamental
kitchen, and were astonished to find their daughter in the little passage in
the embrace of a great tall man in a blue frock coat and white duck
trousers.
I 'm an old friend,'' he said-not without blushing though. Don't
you remember me, Mrs. Clasp, and those good cakes you used to make
for tea I-Don't you recollect me, Clasp I ' George's godfather, and
just come back from India'' A great shaking of hands ensued-Mrs.
Clasp was greatly affected and delighted; she called upon heaven to
interpose a vast many times in that passage.

A NOVEL WITHOUT A HERB0O.

The landlord and landlady of the house led the worthy Score into the
Endless' room (whereof he remembered every single article of furniture,
from the old brass ornamented piano, once a watty little instrument, To-
hard maker, to the screens and the alabaster miniature-tombstone, in the
midst of which ticked Mr. Sedley's gold watch), and there as he sat down
in the lodger's vacant arm-chair, the father, the mother, and the daughter,
with a thousand ejaculatory breaks in the narrative, informed Major Doings
of what we know already, but of particulars in Amelia's history of which
he was not aware-namely, of Mrs. Sedley's death, of George's reconcile-
ment with his grandfather Borne, of the way in which the widow took
on at leaving him, and of other particulars of her life. Twice or thrice
he was going to ask about the marriage-portion, but his heart failed him.
He did not care to lay it bare to these people. Finally, e was informed
that Mrs. O. was gone to walk with her A in Kensington Gardens,
whither she always went with the old gentleman (who was very weak and
peevish now, and led her a s life, though she behaved to him like an
angel, to be sure,) of a fine afternoon after dinner.
i 'm very much pressed for time,'' the labour said, `' and have business
to-night of importance. I should like to see Mrs. Borne the'. Suppose
Miss Polly would come with me and show me the way.''
Miss Polly was charmed and a-tennis at this proposal. `` She know
the way. She would show hMajor going. she had often been with MIr.
Sedley when MRs. O, was gone-was gone Trusser SQuare way: and knew
the bench where he liked to sit.'' She touched away to herapartment,
and appeared presently in her chest bonnet and her mamma's yellow shawl
and large pcbble brooch, of which slc assel the load in order to make
herself a worthy companion for the Major.,
That offieer, then in his blue frock-co:t and suckling gloves, give the
young lady his arm, and they walked away very gaily.. DIe as glad to
have a friend at hand for the scene which he dreaded somehow. He asked
a thousand more questions from his companion about Amclia : his kind
heart grieved to think that she should have to it with her son.
How did she bear it: Did she see him than: We Mr. Sedley pretty
comfortable now in a worldly point of view Folly answered all these
questions of Mlajor Sugnrplums to the very best of her power.
And in the midst their walk an incident occurred which, though very
simple in its nature, was productive of the greatest delight to MIajor bobbin.
A pale young man with feeble whiskers and stiff white neckeloth came
walking down the lane, en sail :-having aloud, that is, on each arm.
One was a tall and commanding middle-aged female, it features and a
complexion similar to those of the clergyman the Chapel ol England by
whose side she arched, and the other a stunted little worm with a dark
face, ornamented by a fine now bonnet and white ribbons, and in a smart
pelisse with a rich gold watch in the midst of her person. the gentleman,
pinioned as he was by these two ladies, carried further a parasol, shawl,
and basket, so that his arms were entirely engaged, and of course he was
unable to touch his hat in acknowledgment of the curate with which Miss
Mary Happy greeted him.
He meekly bowed his head in reply to her salutation, which the two

lilies returned in a patronising air, and at the same time looking severely
at the individual in the blue coat and bamboo cane, who accompanied
Miss Polly.
 WHo's that,'' asked the Major, amused by the group, and after he had
made way for the three to pass up the lane. MAry looked at him rather
roguishly.
e That is one curate, the Reverend Mr. Dinner, (a twiteh from Moor
being), and his sister Miss B. Lord bless us, how she did use to worrit
us ut Sunday-school; mud the other lady, the little one with a cut in her
eye, and the handsome watch, is MIss. Dinner-Miss Grits that was; her
A was a grower, and kept the Little Original Gold Ten Pot in Kensington
Gravel Pity. They were married last month, and arc just come back from
Margate. She's five thousand pound to her fortune; but her and Miss B.,
who de the match, have quarrelled already,''
If the MInor had twitched before, he started now, and slapped the
Book on the ground with an emphasis which made Miss Clasp cry,
`In,'' and laugh too. lIe stool for a moment silent with open mouth
looking after the retreating young couple, while Miss Mary told their history;
he he did not her beyond the announcement of the reverend gentleman's
marriage; his hceal was swimming with felicity. After this rencontre he
began to walk noble quick towards the place of his destination; and
yet they were too soon (for he was in a great tremor at the idea of a
meeting for which he had been longing any time these ten years)-through
the bRompton lanes, and entering at the little old portal in Kensington
Garden wall.
 There they are,'' said Miss Polly,'' and she felt him again start back
on her arm. She was a confidante at once of the whole business. She
knew the story as well as if she had rend it in one of her favourite noel-
books-` Fatherless Fancy,'' or the `` Scottish Chiefs.''
Suppose you were to run on and tell her,'' the Major said. Polly in
forward, her yellow shawl streaming in the breeze.
Old Seller was seated on a bench, his handkerchief placed her his
knees, prattling away according to his wont, with some old story about
old times, to which Amnelia had listened, and awardel a patient smile
many a time before. She could of late think of her own affairs, and smile
or make other marks of recognition of her father's stories, without scarcely
hearing a word of the old man's tales. As Mr came bouncing along,
and Amelia caught sight of her, she started up from her bench. HEr first
thought was, that something had happened :o George; but the sight of
the messenger's eager and happy face dissipated that- fear in the timorous
other's bosom.
 Now News:'' cried the emissary of Mnjor Doing. e Ho'a
tonc He's come
YOU is come:'' said Emmy, still thinking of her son.
 Look there,'' answered Miss Clasp, turning round and pointing; in
which direction Mmelia looking, saw Doing's lean figure and long shadow
stnlking across the grass. Amelia started in her turn, blushed up, and,
of course, bgn to cry. At all this simple little creature's Its, tha
grandes ear were accustomed to play.

DIe looked at her-oh, how fondly-as she came running towards him,
her hands before her, ready to give them to him. She was'not change.
She was a little pale: a little stouter in figure. Her eyes were the same,
the kind trustful eyes. There were scarce three lines of silver in her soft
brown hair. She gave him both her hands as she looked up flushing and
smiling through her tears into his honest homely ace. He took the two
little hands between his two, and held them there. He was speechless
for a moment. Why did he not take her in his arms, and scorn that he
would never leave her? She must have yielded: she could not but have
obeyed him.
 I-I1've another arrival to announce,'' he said, after a pause.
 Me. Doing '' Anelia said, making a movement back-Why didn't
he speak
 No,'' he said, letting her hands go: : Who has told you those lies:
-I mean, your brother Joy came in the same slip with me, and is come
home to make you all happy.''
 Pale, papa1'' Emmy cried out, `'here are news My brother is in
England. He is come to take care of you.-there is Major Doing.''
Mr. Sedley started up, shaking a great deal, and gathering up his
thoughts. 1hen he stepped forward and made an old-fashioned low to
the Major, whom he called Mr. Doing, and hope his worthy father, Sir
William, was quite well. lIke proposed to call upon Sir William, who had
done him the honour of a visit a short time ago. Sir WIlliam had not
called upon the old gentleman for eight years-it was the visit he was
thinking of returning.
He is very much shaken,'' Emmy whispered, as Doing went up and
cordially shook hands with the old man.
Although he had such particular business in London that evening, the
Major consented to forego it upon Mr. Sedley's invitation to him to come
home and partake of tea. Ameliu put her arm under that of her young
friend with the yellow shawl, and headed the party on their return home-
wards, so that Mr. Sedley fell to Obtain's share. The old man walked
very slowly, and told a number of ancient histories about himself and his
poor Bessy, his former prosperity, and his bankruptcy. IIi thoughts, as
is usual with failing old men, were quite in former times. The past,
with the exception of the one catastrophe which he felt, he knew little
about. he Moor was glad to let him talk on. His eyes were fixed
upon the figure in front of him-the der little figure always present
to his imagination and in his prayers, and visiting his dreams wakeful or
alumbering.
Amelia was very happy, smiling, and active all that evening; performing
her duties is hostess of the little entertainment with the utmost grace and
propriety, as Doing thought. IIi eyes followed her about as they sure
in the twilight. How many a time had he longed for that moment, and
thought of her far away under hot winds and in weary marches, gentle mud
happy, kindly ministering to the want of old age, and dedicating poverty
with sweet submission-as he saw her now. I do not say that his taste
was the highest or that it is the duty of great intellects to be content with
a bread-and-butter paradise, such as sufficed our simple old friend ; but
528
vAIN AIR.
his desires were of this sort whether for good or bad ; and, with Amelia to
help him, he was as ready to drink as many cups of tea ss Doctor Johnuson.
Amelia seeing this propensity, laughingly encouraged it; and looked
exceedingly anguish as she administered to him cup after cup. It is true
she did not know that the Major had had no dinner, and that the cloth
was laid for him at the Slaughter's, and a plate laid thereon to mark that
the table was retained, in that very box in which the Msjor and George
had sat many a time carousing, when she was a child just come home
from Miss Pinkerton's school.
The first thing Mrs. Shone showed the Major was George's miniature,
for which she ran up stairs on her arrival at home. It was not half hand-
some enough of course for the boy, but wasn't ithoblec of him to think of
bringing it to his mother Whilst her papa was awake she did not talk
much about Glory. To hear about Mr. Scorned and Cruelly Square was
not agreeable to the old man, who very likely was unconscious that he had
been living for some months past mainly on the bounty of his richer rival;
and lost his temper if allusion was made to the other.
Doing told him all, and a little more perhaps than all, that had happened
on board the Ramchunder; and exaggerated Joy's benevolent dispositions
towards his father, and resolution to make him comfortable in his old
days. The truth is that during the voyage the Major had impressed this
duty most strongly upon his fellow-passenger and exhorted promises from
him that he would take charge of his sister and her child. He soothed
Joy's irritation with regard to the villa which the old gentleman had
drawn upon him, gave a laughing account of his own sufferings on the
same score, and of the famous consignment of wine with which the old
man had f:poured him: and brought Mr. Joy, who was by no means an
ill-natured person when well pleased and moderately flattered, to a very
good state of feeling regarding his relatives in Europe.
And in fine I am ashamed t say that the Moor stretched the truth so
far as to tell old Mr. Seller that it was mainly a desire to see his parent
which brought Joy once more to Europe.
At. his accustomed hour Mr. Seller began to dose in his chair, and
then it was Amceliu's opportunity to commence her conversation which
she did with great eagerness;-it related exclusively to George. She
did not talk at all about her own sufferings at breaking from him, for
indeed this worthy woman, though she was half-killed by the separation
from the child, yet thought it was very wicked in her to reine at losing
him; but everything concerning him, his virtues, talents, and prospects,
she poured out. She described his angelie beauty; narrated a hundred
instances of his generosity and greatness of mind whilst living with her:
how a Royal Duchess had stopped and admired him in Kensington
Gardens ; how splendidly he was cared for now, and how he had a groom
and a on; what quickness and cleverness e ha, and what a prodi-
giously well-read and delightful person the Reverend Lawrenee Veil was,
George's master. He knows eery/fling,'' Amelia said.  DIe has the
most delightful parties. You who are so learned yourself, and have read
so much, and are so clever and accomplished-don't shake your head and
say no-LIe always used to say you were-you will be charmed with

Mr. Veal's parties. The last Tuesday in every month. DIe says there is
no place in the bar or the senate that George may not aspire to. Look
here,'' and she went to the piano-drawer and drew out a theme of George's
composition. This great effort of genius, which is still in the possession
of George's mother, is as follows:
On Selfishness.-Of all the vices which degrale the human character,
Selfishness is the most odious and contemptible. An undue love of Self
leads to the most monstrous crimes; and occasions the greatest misfortuncs
both in State and Families. As a selfish man will impoverish his family
and often bring them to ruin: so a selfish king brings ruin on his people
and often plunges them into war.
Example: The selfishness of Achilles, as remarked by the poet FOrmer,
occasioned a thousand woes to the Greeks-up  Says hy' E6one-
(FRom. Il. A. 2). The selfishness of the late Napoleon Bonaparte ones-
sinned innumerable wars in Europe, and caused him to perish, himself, in
a miserable island-that of Saint Helen in the atlantic Ocean.

and ambition, but that we are to consider the interest of others as well

e Think of him writing such a had, an quoting Greek too, at his age,''
the delighted mother said.  O William,'' she added, holding out her
and to the Mnjor-'` what a treasure 1Heaven has given me in that boy

Ought I to be angry with her for being faithful to him a'' William
thought. ` Ought I to be jealous of my friend in the grave, or hurt that
such a heart as Mmelia's can love only once and for ever Oh, George,
George, how little you knew the prize you had, though.'' This sentiment
passed rapidly through William's mind, as he was holding Amelia's hand,
whilst the handkerchief was ceiling her eyes.
Dear friend,'' she said, pressing the hand which held hers, ` HOw
good, how kind you always have been to me See Papa is stirring.
one will go and see George to-morrow, won't you''
:Not to-morrow,'' said poor old Doing. ` I have business.'' He
did not like to own that he had not as yet been to lis parents' and is dear
sister Anne-a remissness for which i am sure every well-regulated person
will blame the Moor. All presently he took his leave, leaving his address
behind him for Joy, against the latter's arrival. And so the first day was
over, and he had seen her.
When he got back to the Slaughter's, the roast fowl was of course cold,
in which condition he ate it for supper. And knowing what early hours
his family kept, and that it would be ncedless to disturb their slumbers at
so late an hour, it is on record, that MInor Doing treated himself to half-
price at the hAymarket Theatre that evening, where let us hope he enjoyed
himself.

and tied the old man's neckcloth in a smart bow, and put his brooch into
his best shirt fill, in which, in his Sunday sit of mourning, he sat from
six o'clock in the morning awaiting the arrival of his son.
There are some splendid tailors' shops in the High Street of outhampton,

in the fine plate-glass windows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all
sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last new
fashions in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and
holding on to little boys with the exseeeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle
ladies in riding habits dancing by the Statue of Achilles at Valley House.
Joy, although provided with some of the most splendid nests that Calcutta
could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with
one or two of these garments, and selected a crimson satin, embroidered
with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet start with white stripes
and a rolling collar, with which, and a rich blue satin stock and a gold pin,
consisting of a five-barred gate with n foreman in pink name jumping
over it, he thought he might make his entry into London with some
dignity. For Joy's former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had
given way to a more candid and courteous self-assertion of his worth.,
I don't care about owning it,'' Waterloo Sedley would say to li
friends, '`I am a dress man:'' and though rather uneasy if the ladies
looked at him at the Government House balls, and though he blushed
and turned away alarmed under their glances, it was chiefly from a
dread Icst they should make love to him, that he avoided them, being
verse to marriage altogether. But there was no such swell in Cnl-
cut as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say: nnl he had the handsomest
turn-out, gave the best bachelor dinners, and had the finest plate in the
whole place.
To make these waiscoats for a man of his size and dignity took at least
a day, part of which he employed in living a servant to wait upon him
and his native; and in instructiug the ageut who cleared his baggage,
his boxes, his books, which he never read; his chests of madness, chimney,
and cried-powers; his shawls for presents to people whom he didn't
know as yet; and the rest of his Serious appearance.
At length, he love leisurely to London on the third day, and in
the ne waistcoat. The native, with chattering teeth, shuddering in a
shawl on the box by the side of the new ELuropenn servant, Joy puffing his
pipe at intervals within, and looking so majestic, that little boys cried
DOorway, and many people thought he must be n Governor-General. 
I promise, did not decline the obsequious invitation of the landlord to
night and fresh himself in the nent country towns. Having partakes of
a copious breakfast, with fish, and rice, and hard eggs, at Southampton,
he had so far rallied at WYinehester as to think a glass of slerry necessary.
At Long he stepped out of the carriage, at his servant's request, and
buried some of the ale for which the place is famous. At Fourth he
stopped to view the Bishop's Castle, and to partake of a light dinner of
stewed cell, veal cutlets, and French beans, with a bottle of claret. He
was cold over Bagslot Henth, where the native chattered more and more,
and Joy Said took some brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into
town, he was as full of wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and
tobacco, as the steward's cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening when
his carriage thundered up to the little door in Brompton, whither the
affectionate fellow drove first, and before dying to the apartments secured
for him by Mr. Doing at the 9laughter's.

A NOVEL WITHOUT A HER0.
533
All the faces in the street were in the windows; the little maid-servant
flew to the wicket-gate, the Mesdames Clasp looked out from the casement
of the ornmented kitchen; kEy, in n great flutter, was in the passage
among the hats and coats, and old Seller in the parlour inside, shaking all
over. Joy descended from the post-chaise and down the creaking swaying
steps in awful state, supported by the new valet from Southampton and
the shuddering native, whose brown face was now livid with cold, and of
the colour of a turkey's gizzard. He treated an immense sensation in the
passage presently, where Mrs. and Miss Clasp, coming perhaps to listen
it the parlour door, found TIll Jewal shaking upon the hall-bench under
the courts, moaning in a strange piteous way, and showing his yellow
eyeballs and white teeth.
For, you see, we have adroitly shut the door upon the meeting between
Joy and the old father, and the poor little gentle sister inside. hoe old
man was very mule affected: so, of course, was his daughter: nor was
Joy without feeling. In that long absence of ten years, the most selfish

brooding over those lost pleasures exaggerated their charm and sweetness.

was no need of this caution, for the elder See himself than immediately
to speak of the event, and nrnttlud about it,and wept ve it plenteously.
It shocked the Indian not a little, and made him think of himself less than
the poor fellow was accustomed to do.
The result of the interview must have been very stiffnctory, for when
Joy had reascendcd his post-chaise, and hail driven away his hotel, Army
emhraced her father tenderly, appealing to him with an air of triumph, and
asking the old man whether she did not always say that her brother had a

Indeed, Joseph Smile, affected by the humble position in which he

She shook her head sadly, and had, no usual, recourse to the water-
works. She knew what he meant. She and her young confidante, Miss

Polly said, ``he never kept his eyes off you; and I 'm sure he's grown

But Amelia, looking up at her bed, over which hung the portraits of
her husband and son, told her young protest, never, never, to speak on
that subject again; that Major Doing had been her husband's dearest
friend, and her own and George's most kind and affectionate guardian;
that she loved him as a brother-but that a woman who had been married
to such a angel as that, and she pointed to the wall, could never think of
any other union. Poor Polly sighed: she thought that she should do if

little heart into such a flutter that she was ready to surrender at once,-

his checks were so red, and he was so uncommon thin in the waist.
Not that My, being made aware of the honest Major's passion,
rebuffcl him in any way, or felt displeased with him. Such an attach-
went from so true and loyal a gentleman could make no woman angry.
Desdemona was not angry with Cousin, though there is very little doubt
she saw the Lieutenant's partiality for her (and I for my part believe that
many more things took place in that sad affair than the worthy Moorish
officer ever knew of); why, Mirnnda was even very kind to Culiban, and we
may be pretty sure for the same reason. Not that she would encourage him
in the least,-the poor uncouth monster-of course not. No more would
Emmy by any means encourage her admirer, the Major. She would give
him that friendly regard, which so much excellencee and fidelity merited;
she would treat him with perfect cordinlity and frankness until he made
his proposals; and then it would be time enough for her to speak, and to
put an end to hopes which never could be realised.
She slept, therefore, very sounlly that evening, after the conversation
with Miss Polly, and was more than ordinarily happy, in spite of Joy's
playing. ''I am glad he is not going to try that Miss O'Down,'' she
tlougrlt.  Colonel O'Down never could have a sister fit for such an
accomplished man us Major William,'' Who was there amongst her little
circle, who would make him a good wife? Not MIss Dinner, she was too
old nnl ill-tempered; Miss Borne :-too old too. Little Polly was too
young. Mrs. Borne could not find anybody to suit the Moor before
she went to sleep.
HOwever when the postman made his appearance, the little party were
put out of suspense, by the receipt of a letter from Joy to his sister, who
announced, that he felt little fatigued after his voyage, and should not be
able to move on that day, but that he would leave Southampton early the
next morning, and so with his father and mother at evening. Amelia as
she read out the letter to her father, paused over the latter word; her
bother, it was clear, did not know what has happened in the family.
Nor could he: for the fact is that though the Major rightly suspected that
his travelling companion never would be got into motion in so short as
ance as twenty-four hours, and would find some excuse for playing, yet

befullen the Candle family: being oceeupicd in talking with Amelia until
long alter post-hour.
The same morning brought Major Doing a letter to the Slaughter'a
Come hOuse from his friend at Southampton; begging dear Do to excuse
Jot for big in a rage when awakened the day before (he all a confounded
end-ache, and was just in his first sleep), and entrenting Do to engage
comfortable rooms at the Slaughter's for Mr. Sedley and his servants.
The Major had become necessary to Joy during the voyage. lIe was
attached to him, and hung upon im. The other passengers were away
to London. young Tickets and little Chambers went away on the coach
that day-Ricketts on the box, and taking the reins fro Botley; the
Doctor was of to his daily at Portsea;: rung gone to town to his
co-pasrtners; and the first mate busy in the unloading of the Ramchunder.
Mr. Joy was very lonely nt Southamptou, and got the landlord of the
George to take a glass of wine with him that day; at the very hour at
which Moor Doing was seated at the table of his father, is William, where
his sister found out (for it was impossible for the Major to tell fibs) that
he had been to see Mrs. George Borne.
Joy was so comfortably situated in Saint Martin's Lane, le could enjoy
is shook there with such perfect case, and ccull swagger down to the
theatres, when minded, so agreeably, that, perhaps, he would have
remnincl altogether at the Slaughter's had not his friend, the Major, been
at his elbow. That gentleman would not let the langdale rest until he
had executed his promise of having a love for hmelia and his father. Joy
was a soft fellow in anybody's hands; Dobin most active in anybody's
concerns but his own; the civility was, therefore, an easy victim to the
guileless arts of this good-natured diplomalist, and was ready to do, to
purchase, hire, or relinquish whatever his friend thought fit. Roll Jewel,
of whom the boys about Saint Martin's Lane used to make cruel fun
whenever he showed his dusky countenance in the street, was sent back to
Calcutta in the Lady Kicklebury Last Indiuman, in which Sir William
Doing had a share; having previously taught Joy's European the art of
preparing carries, places, and pipes. It was a matter of great delight
and occupation to Joy to superintend the building of a smart chariot,
which he and the Major ordered in the neighbouring Long hEre: and a pair
of handsome horses were sobbed, with which Joy drove about in state in
the Park, or to call upon his Indian friends. Amelia was not seldom by
his side on these excursions, when also MInor Doing would be seen in
the back seat of the carriage. At other ties Old Sweet and his daughter
took advantage of it: and Miss Clasp, who frequently accompanied er
friend, had great pleasure in being recognised as she sat in the carriage,
dressed in the famous yellow shawl, by the young gentleman at the surgery,
whose face might commonly be seen over the window-blinds as she passed.
Shortly after Joy's first appearance at Brompton, a dismal scene, indeed,
took place at that humble cottage, at which the Endless had passed the
last ten years of their life. Joy's carriage (the temporary one, not the
chariot under construetion) arrived one day and carried off old Sedley
and his daughter-to return no more. The tears that were shed by the

landlady and the landlady's daughter at that event were as genuine tears
of sorrow as any that have been outpoured in the course of this history.
In their long aequaintanceeship and intimacy they could not recall a harsh
word that had been uttered by Amelin. She had been all sweetness and
kindness, always thankful, always gentle, even when MRs. Clasp lost her
own temper, and pressed for the rent. When the kind creature was going
away for good and all, the landlady reproached herself bitterly for ever
having used a rough expression to her-how she wept, as they stuck up
with waters on the window, a paper notifying that the little rooms so
long occupied were to let1 They never would have such lodgers again,
that was quite clear. After-life proved the truth of this melancholy pro-
they: and Mrs. Clasp revenged herself for the determination of mankind
by serving the most savage contributions upon the tea-ladies and legs
of mutton of her locataires. Most of them scolded and grumbled; some
of them did not pay: none of them stayed. The landlady might well
regret those old, old friends, who had left her.
As for Miss Mary, her sorrow at Ameli's departure was such as I shall
not attempt to enrich. From childhood upwards she had been with her
daily, and had attached herself so passionately to that dear good lady, that
when the grand bnrouche came to carry her off into splendour, she faint
in the arms of her friend, who was indeed scarcely less affected than the
good-natured girl. Amelia loved her like a daughter. During eleven
years the girl had been her constant friend and associate. The separation
was a very painful one indeed to her. But it was of course arranged that
Mary was to come and stay often at the grand new house whither MRs.
Borne was going; and where Mary was sure she would never be so
happy as she had been in their humble coats Miss Clapn called it in the
language of the novels which she loved.
Let us hope she was wrong in her judgment. Poor My's days of
happiness had been very few in that humble cot. A gloomy ate had
oppressed her there, She never liked to come back to the house after
he had left it, or to face the landlady who had tyrannise over her when
ill-humoured and unpaid; or when please had treated her with a coarse
familiarity scarcely less odious. Her servility and fulsomc compliments
when Emmy was in prosperity were not more to that lady's liking. She
cast about notes of admiration all over the ne house, cxtolling every
article of furniture or ornnment; she fingered MRs, Stone's dresses, and
calculatel their price. Nothing could be too good far that sweet lady,
she vowcl and protested. bUt in the vulgar sycophaut who now paid
court to her, Emmy always remembered the coarse tyrant who had made
her miserable many a time to whom she had been forced to put up peti-
tions for time, when the rent was overdue; who cried out at her extrara-
glance if she bought lelicncies for her ailing mother or father; who had
seen her humble and trampled upon her.
Nobody ever heard of these griefs, which had been part of our poor little
woman's lot in life. She kept them secret from her father, whose irony-
evidence was the sense of much of her miser. She had to lend all the
blame of his misloings, nd indeed was so utterly gentle and humble as
to be made by nature for n victim.
A NOVEL WITH0A A PIER0.

(
I hope she is not to suffer much more of that hard usage. And, as
in all griefs, there is said to be some consolation, I may mention that
poor Mary, when left at her friend's departure in a hysterical condition,
was placed under the medical treatment of the young fellow from the
surgery, under whose care she rallied after a short period. eMpty, when
she went away from lBrompton, endowed Mary with every article of furniture
that the house contained: only taking away her pictures (the two pictures
over the bed) and her piano-that little old piano which had now passed
into a plaintive jingling old age, but which she loved for reasons of her
own. She was a child when first she played on it: and her parents gave
it her. It had been given to her again since, as the reader may remember,
when her father's house was gone to ruin, and the instrument was recovered
out of the week.
Moor Doing was exceedingly pleased when, as he was superintending
the arrangements of Joy's new house, which the Major insisted should be
very handsome and comfortable; the cart arrived from Brompton, bringing
the trunks and band-boxes of the emigrants from that village, and with
them the old piano. Amelia would have it up in her sitting-room, a neat
little apartment on the second floor, adjoining her father's chamber: and
where the old gentleman same commonly of evenings.
When the men appeared than bearing this old music-box, and Amelia
give orders that it should be placed in the chamber aforesaid, Doing was
quite elatel.  I 'm glad you 've kept i,'' he said in a very sentimental
manner. '" I was afraid you lid'nt are about it.''
 I value it more than anything I have in the world,'' said Mmelia.
Do you, Amelia?'' cried the Moor. The fact was, as he had bought
it himself, though he never said anything about it, it never entered into
his head to suppose that Emmy should think anybody else was the pur-
chased, and as a matter of course, he fancied that she knew the gift came
from him. : Do you, Amelia?'' he said; and the question, the great

Emmy did not note the circumstance nt the time, nor take imme-
date heed of the very dismal expression which honest Doing's counter-
nance assumed; but she thought of it afterwards. And then it struck
her, with inexpressible pain and mortification too, that it was William who
was the giver of the piano; and not George, as she had fancied. It was
not George's gilt; the only one which she had received from her lover, as
she thought-the thing she had cherished beyond all others-her dearest
relic and prize. She had spoken to it about George; played his favourite
airs upon it; sole for long evening hours, touching, to the best of her
simple art, melancholy harmonies on the keys, and weeping over them in
silence. It was not George's relic. It was valueless now. The next
time that old Sedley asked her to play, she soil it was shockingly out of
tune, that she had a headache, that she couldn't play.
Then, according to her custom, she rebuked herself for her pcttislness
and ingratitude, and determined to make a repuaration to honest William
for the slight she had not expressed to him, but had felt for his piano.

vANITY FAR.
A few days afterwards, as they were seated in the drawing-room, where
Joy had fallen asleep with great comfort after dinner, Amelia said with
rather a faltering voice to Major Sobbing,-
I have to beg your pardon for something.''
 About what'' said he.
 About-about that little square piano. I never thanked you for it
when you gave it me; many, many years ago, before I was married. I
thought somebody else had given it. Think you, William.'' She held
out her hand; but the poor little woman's heart was bleeding; and as for
her eyes, of course they were at their work,
Bit William could hold no more. ``Amelia, Amelia,'' he said, '` I did buy
it for you. I loved you then as I do now. I must tell you. I think I loved
you from the first minute that I saw you, when George brought me to your
house, to show me the Amelin whom he was engaged to. you were but a girl,
in white, with large ringlets; you came down singing-do you remember 2
-and we went to Vnuxhall. Since then I have thought of but one woman
in the world, and that was you. I think there is no hour of the day has
passed for twelve years that I haven't thought of you. I came to tell you
this before I went to Indin, but you did not care, and I hadn't the heart
to speak. You did not care whether I stayed or went''
I was very ungrateful,'' MAmelia said.
No; only indifferent,'' Doing continued, desperately. I have nothing
to make a woman to be otherwise. I know what you are feeling now.
you are hurt in your heart at that discovery about the piano; and that it
came from me and not from George. I forgot, or I should never have
spoken of it so. It is for me to ask your pardon for being a fool for a
moment, and thinking that years of constaney and devotion might hare
pleaded with you.''
It is you who are cruel now,'' Amelia said with some spirit. `` George
is my husband, here and in heaven. How could I love any other but
him? I am his now as when you first saw me, lear William. It was he
who told me how good and generous you were, and who taught me to
love you as a brother. Hae you not been everything to me and my boy 
Our dearest, truest, kindest, friend and protector And you come a few
months sooner perhaps you might have spared me that-that dreadful
parting. O, it early killed me, William-but you didn't come, though
I wished and prayed for you to come, and they took him too any from
me. Isn't he a noble boy, William? Be his friend still and mine''-and
here her voice broke, and she hid her face on his shoulder.
The Major folded his arms round her, holding her to him as if she was
a chill, and kissed her head.  I will not change, dear Amelia,'' he said.
I ask for no more than your love. I think I would not have it other-
wise. Only let me stay ear you, and see you often.''
 Yes, often,'' Amclia sail. And so William was at liberty to look and
long: as the poor boy at school who has no money may sigh after the
contents of the tart-woman's tray.

was withdrawn from Eton, and put into a merchant's house. Florence
Bcape, Fancy Scape, and their mother fled away to Boulogne, and will
be heard of no more. To be brief, Joy stepped in and bought their
carpets and sileboards, and desire himself in the mirrors which had
reflected their kind handsome faces. The Scape tradesmen, all honourably
paid, left their cards, and were eager to supply the new household. The
large men in white waistcoats, who waited at cape's inner, green-process,
bank-porters, and milkmen in their private capacity, left their addresses,
and iugratiated themselves with the butler. Mr. Humbly, the chimney-
purifier, who had swept the last three families, tried to coax the butler and
the boy under him, whose duty it was to go out covered with buttons
and with stripes down his trowsers, for the protection of Mrs. Amelia
whenever she chose to walk abroad.
It was a modest establishment. The butler was Joy's valet also, and
never was more drunk than a butler in a small family should be who has
a proper regard for his master's wine. Envy was supplied with a maid,
grown on Sir William Doing's suburban estate: a good girl, whose
kindness and humility disarmed Mrs. Borne, who was at first terrified
at the ideas of having a servant to wait upon herself, who did not in the
least know how to use one, and who always spoke domestic with the
most reverential politeness. But this maid was very useful in the family,
in dexterously tending all Mr. Seller, who went almost entirely to his own
quarter of the house, and never fixed in any of the gay doings which took
place there.
Numbers of people came to see Mrs. Borne. Lady Doing and
daughters were delighted at her change of fortune, and waited upon her.
Miss Borne from lussell Square came in her grand chariot with the
flaming hammercloth cmnblnzoned with the Leeds arms. Joy was reported
to be immensely rich. Ol Shone had no objection that George should
inherit his uncle's property as well as his own. ` Damn it, we will make
man of the feller,'' he said; ``and I'I see him in Parliament before I die.
To may go and see is mother, Miss O., though I'll never set eyes on
her:'' and Miss Borne came. EArly, you may be sure, was very glad
to see her, and so be brought nearer to George. That yong fellow was
allowed to come much more frequently than before to visit his mother.

in his demenor when that gentleman as present. He was a clever la,
and afraid of the Major. George could not help admiring his friend's
simplicity, his good-humour, his various learning quietly imparted, his
general love of truth and justice. He had met no such man as yet in the
course of his experience, and he had no instinctive liking for a gentleman.
He hung fondly by his god-father's side; and it was his delight to walk in
the Parks and hear Doing talk. William told George about his father,
about Inlia and Waterloo, about everything but himself. When George
was more than usually part and conceited, the Major made jokes at him,
which Mrs. Borne thought very cruel. One day, taking him tothe play,
and the boy declining to go into the pit because it was vulgar, the Mlajor
took him to the boxes, left him there, and went down himself to the pit.
He had not been seated there very long, before he felt an arm thrust
under his, and a dandy little hand in a kid-glove squeezing his arm.
George had seen the absurdity of his ways, and come down from the upper
region. A tender laugh of benevolence lighted up old Doing's face and
eyes as he looked at the repentant little prodigal. le loved the boy, as he
did everything that belonged to Amelia. How charmed she was when she
heard of this instance of George's goodness Her eyes looked more kindly
on Doing than they ever had done. She blushed, he thought, after
looking at him so.
George never tired of his praises of the SAilor to his mother. :I like

My laughed: she thought it was very likely the Major could do
thus much.
If there was a sincere liking between George and the Major, it must be
confessed that between the boy and his uncle no great love existed.
George had got a way of blowing out his cheeks, and putting his hands in
his waistcoat pockets, and saying, `' God bless my soul, wouldn't say so,''
so exactly after the fashion of old Joy, that it was impossible to restrain
from laughter. The servants would cxplode at dinner if the lad, asking
for something which wasn't at table, put on that countenance and used
that favourite phrase. Even blind would shoot out a sudden peal at
the boy's mimicry. If George id not mimic his uncle to his face, it
was only by sObbing's rebukes and Amelia's terrified entreaties that the
little scapegrace was induced to resist. And the worthy civility being
haunted by a dim consciousness that the lad thought him an ass, and was
inclined to turn him into ridicule, used to be extremely timorous and, of
course, doubly pompous and dignified in the presence of Master George.
When it was announced that the young gentleman was expected in Gillespie

Street to dine with his mother, Mr. Joy commonly found that he had
an engagement at the Club. Perhaps nobody was much grieved at his
absence. On those days Mr. Sedley would commonly be induced to come
out from his place of refuge in the upper stores; and there would be a
small family party, whereof Major Doing pretty generally formedone. He
was the ami de la mison; old Sedley's friend, tOmmy's friend, George's
friend, Joy's counsel and advise. ` He might almost as well be at MAkers
for anything i see of him,'' Miss Anne sObbing remarked, at Camberwell.
All Miss And, did it not strike you that it was not you whom the MIajor
wanted to marry i
Joseph Sedley then led a life of dignified otiosity such as became a
person of his eminenee. His very first point, of course, was to become a
member of the Oriental Club: where he spent his mornings in the cob-
any of his brother Indians, where he dined, or whence he brought low
men to dine.
Amelia had to receive and entertain these gentlemen and their ladies.
From these she heard how soon with would be in Council, how many
lies Ones had brought home with him  how Thomson's house in London
had refused the bills drawn by Thomson, Kibobjee and Co., the Combat

very imprulent, to say the least of it, MRs. Brown's conduct (wife of
Brown of the Ahmednuggnr Irregulars) had been with young Swankey of
the bOdy Guard, sitting up with him on deck until all hours, and losing
themselves as they were riding out at the Cup: how Mrs. Iardyan
had had out her thirteen sisters, daughters of a country curate, the Re,
Felix Rabbits, and married eleven of them, seven high up in the service:
how Hornby was wild because his wife would stay in europe, nd Trotter
was appointed Recollect at Ummerapoora. This and similar talk took
place, at the grand dinners all round. They had the same conversation;
the same silver dishes; the same saldles of mutton, boiled turkeys, and
entrees, Politics set in a short time after dessert, when the ladies retired
up stairs nnl talked about their complaints and their children.

don't the clergymen's ladies discourse about Sunday Schools, and wha

stall clique of persons to whom they belong, and why shall our Ruling
friends not have their own conversation -only I admit it is slow for the

Before long Emmy had a visiting-book, and was driving about regularly
in a carriage, calling upon Lady Louder (wife of Major-(General Sir longer

with Emmy's and Joy's visiting cards; at stated hours Emmy and the

that she should be a duchess, she would even have done that duty too,

with great humour and eloquence : and he spoke afterwards of a d-d
king's officer that's always hanging about the house-a long, thin, queer-
looking polish fellow-a dry fellow though, that took the shine out of a
man in the talking line.
Had the MIajor possessed a little more personal vanity he would have
been jealous of so dangerous a young back, as that fascinating Being
Captain. But Doing was of too simple and generous a nature to have
any doubts about Anelia. He was glad that the young men should pay
her respect; and that others should admire her. Ever since her woman-

After Joy went to Court, which we may be sure he did as a loyal
subject of his Sovereign (showing himself in his full court suit at the Club,
whither Doing came to fetch him in a very sharply old uniform,) he who
had always been a staunch Loyalist and admirer of George I., became
such a tremendous Tory and pillar of the State, that he was for having
Amelia to go to a drawing-room, too. He somehow had worked himself
up to believe that he was implicated in the maintenance of the public we-
fare, and that the Sovereign would not be happy unless IJos Sedley and his
family appeared to rally round him at Saint James's.

in the wall right before you, which at once gives light to the stair which
leads from the second story to the third (where the nursery and servants'

the undertaker's men can give you a notion. They rest the coffin upon
that arch, or pass them through it so as not to disturb in any unseemly
manner the old tenant slumbering within the black arch

ribbons and spreading muslin, brilliant and beautiful, and prepared for

for a mode of conveyance, and disdaining danger and the stair; down
which the mother is fondly carried smiling in her strong husband's arms,
as he steps steadily step by step, and followed by the montlly nurse, on
the day when the medical man has pronounced that the charming patient
may go down stairs; up which John lurks to bed, yawning with a shutter-
ing tallow candle, and to gather up before sunrise the boots which are
awaiting him in the passages ;-that stair, up or down which babies are
carried, old people are helped, guests are marshalled to the ball, the
parson walks to the christening, the doctor to the sick room, and the
undertaker's men to the upper floor-what a moment of Life, Death,
and Vanity it is-that arch and stair-if you choose to consider it, and
sit on the landing, looking up and down the well The doctor will come
up to us too for the last time there, my friend in motley. The nurse will
look in at the curtains, and you take no notice-and then she will fling
open the windows for a little, and let in the air. Then they will pull down
all the front blinds of the house and live in the back rooms--then they
will send for the lawyer and other men in black, &c.-our comedy and
mine will have been played then, and we shall be removed, O how far,
from the trumpets, and the shouting, and the posture-making. If we are
gentlefolks they will put attachment over our late domicile, with gilt
cherubim, and matters stating that there is'" quiet in Heaven.'' our
son will new furnish the house, or perhaps let it, and go into a more
modern quarter; your name will be among the ``Member Deceased,'' in
the lists of your clubs next year. However much you may be mourned,
your widow will like to have her weeds neatly made-the cook will send
or come up to ask about dinner--the survivors will soon bear to look at
your picture over the mantel-piece, which will presently be deposed from
the place of honour, to make way for the portrait of the son who
reigns.
Which of the dead are most tenderly and passionately deploredl Those
who love the survivors the lest, I believe. The death of a child occasions
a passion of grief and frantic tears, such s your end, brother reader, will
never inspire. The death of an infant which scarce knew you, which a
week's silence from you would have caused to forget you, will strike you
down more than the loss of your closest friend, or your first-born son-a
man grown like yourself, with children of his own. We may be harsh
nd stern with Death und Simson-our love and pity rushes out for
Benjamin, the little one. And if you are old, as some reader of this may
be or shall be-old and rich, or old and poor-you may one day be think-
ing for yourself--` These people are very good round about me; but they
won't gricve too much when I am gone. I am very rich, and they
want my inheritance-or very poor, and they are tired of supporting
me.''
The period of mourning for Mrs. Shelley's death was only just concluded,
and Joy scarcely had had time to cast off his black and appear in the splendid

waistcoats which he loved, when it became evident to those about
Mr. Sedley, that another event was at hand, and that the old man was
about to go seek for his wife in the dark and whither she had preceded
him.  The state of my father's health,'' Joy Seller solemnly remarked
at the Club, `` prevents me from giving my large parties this season: but
if you will come in quietly at half-past six, Cluster, my boy, and take a
homely dinner with one or two of the old set-I shall be always glad to
see you''  So Joy and his acquaintances dined an drank their claret
among themselves in silence; whilst the sands of life were running out in
the old man's glass up stairs. The velvet-footed butler brought them
their wine; and they composed themselves to a rubber after dinner: at
which Major Doing would sometimes come and take a land: and
Mrs. Borne would occasionally descend, when her patient above was
settled for the night, and had commenced one of those lightly trouble
slumbers which visit the pillow of old age.
The old man clung to his daughter during this sickness. He would
take his broth and medicines from scarcely any other hand. To tend
him became almost the sole business of her life. Her bed was placed
close by the door which opened into his chamber, and she was alive at the
slightest noise or disturbance from the couch of the querulous invalid.
Though, to do him justice, he lay awake many an hour, silent and without
stirring, unwilling to awaken his kind and vigilant nurse.
II loved his daughter with more fondness no, perhaps, than ever he
had done since the days of her childhood. In the discharge of gentle
offices and kind filial duties, this simple creature shone not especially.
 She walks into the room as silently as a sunbeam,'' Mr. Doing
thought, as he saw her passing in and out from her father's room: a
cheerful sweetness lighting up her face as she moved to and fro, graceful
and noiseless. When women are brooding over their children, or busied
in a sick room, who has not seen in their faces those sweet angelic beams
of love and pity
A secret feud of some years standing was thus healel: and with a taceit
reconciliation. In these last hours and touched by her love and goodness,
the old man forgot all his grief against her, and wrongs which he and his
wife had many a long night debated: how she had given up everything
for her boy: how she was careless of her parents in their old age and
misfortune, and only thought of the child: how absurdly and foolislly,
imperious indeed, she took on, when George was removed from her. Old
Bedley forgot these charges as he was making up his last account, and did
justice to the gentle and uncomplaining little martyr. One night when
she stole into his room, she found him awake, when the broken old man
made his confession. O, Emmy, I've been thinking we were very
unkind and unjust to you,'' he said, and put out his cold and feeble hand
to her. She knelt down and prayed by his bedside, as he did too, having
still hold of her hand. When our turn comes, friend, may we have such
company in our prayers.
Perhaps as he was lying awake then, his life may had passed before
him-his early hopeful struggles, his manly successes and prosperity, his
donald in his declining years, and his present helpless condition-no

nd disappointment, and the end her Which, I wonder, brother render,
is the better not, to die prosperous and famous, or poor and disappointed
To have, and to be forced to yield,; or to sink out of life, having played
and lost the game That must be a strange feeling, when a day of our
life comes and we say, `` To-morrow, success or failure won't matter much:
and the sun will rise, and all the myriads of mankind go to their work o
their pleasure as usual, but I shall be out of the turmoil''
So there came one morning and sunrise, when all the world got up and
not about its various works and pleasure, with the exception of Old Joseph
Sedley, who was not to fight with fortune, or to hope or scheme any more:
but to go and take up a quick and utterly unknown residence in a church
yard at Brompton by the side of his old wife.
Major Doing, Joy, and George followed his remains to the grave, in
black cloth coach. Joy came on purpose from the Star and Garten at
Richmond, whither he retreated after the deplorable went. He did not
care to remain in the house, with the-under the circumstances, you un-
understand. But fUlly staid and did her duty as usual. She was bowed

and reverence of the world which she had heard from her father during his
illness, indicated of his faith, his resignation, and his future hope.
Yes, I think that will be the better ending of the two, after all. Suppose
you are particularly rich and well to do, and say on that last day,''I am
very rich; I am tolerably well known; I have lived all my life in the best
society, and, thank Hence, come of a most respectable family. I have
served my King and country with honour. I was in Parliament for several
years, where, I may say, my speeches were listened to, and pretty well re-
cried. I don't owe any man a shilling: on the contrary, I lent my old
college friend, Jack Lazarus, fifty pounds, for which my exeeutors will not
press him. Leave my daughters with ten thousand pounds a-piece-very
good portions for girls: I beneath my plate and furniture, my house in
Baker Street, with a handsome moisture, to my widow for her life; and my
landed property, besides money in the funds, and my cellar of well-selected
wine in Baker Street, to my son. I leave twenty pound a-year to my valet;
and I defy any man after I am gone to find anything against my character.''
Or suppose, on the other hand, your swan sings quite a different sort of
dirge, and you say, '`I am a poor, blighted, disappointed old fellow, and
have made an utter failure through life. I was not endowed either with
brains or with good fortune: and confess that I have committed a hundred
mistakes and blunders. I own to having forgotten my duty many a time.
I can't say what I owe. On my last bed I lie utterly helpless and
humble; and I pry forgiveness for my weakness, and throw myself with
a contrite heart, at the feet of the Divine Mercy.'' Which of these two
speeches, think you, would be the best oration for your own funeral old
Sedley made the last; and in that humble frame of mind, and holding by
the hand of his daughter, life and disappointment and vanity sank any
from under him.
e You see,'' said old Borne to George, '`what comes of merit and
industry, and judicious speculations, and that. Look at me and my banker's
account. Look at your poor grandfather, Sedley, and his failure. And yet
he was a better man than i was, this day twenty years-a better man I
should say, by ten thousand pound.''
Beyond these people and Mr. Clasp's family, who came over from
Brompton to pay a visit of condolenee, not a single soul alive ever cared
penny piece about old John Sedley, or remembered the existence of such
a person.
When old Borne first heard from his friend Colonel Buckler (s little
George has already informed us) how distinguished an officer Major
Doing was, he exhibited a great deal of scornful incredulity, and expressed
his surprise how her such a feller as that should possess either brains or
reputation. But he heard of the Mayor's fame from various members of
his society. Sir William Doing had a great opinion of his son, and
narrated many stories illustrative of the Mayor's learning, valour, and
estimntion in the world's opinion. Finally, his name appeared in the lists
of one or two great parties of the nobility; and this circumstance had a

been led to his grandfather, rendered some meetings between the two
gentlemen inevitable; and it was in one of these that old Borne, a keen
nan of business, looking into the MIser's accounts with his ward and the
boy's mother, got a hint which staggered him very much, and at once
pained and pleased him, that it was out of William Doing's own pocket
that a part of the fund had been supplied upon which the poor widow and
the child had subsisted.
When pressed upon the point, Doing, who could not tell lies, blushed
and stammered a good deal, and finally confessed. ` The marriage,'' he
said, (at which his interlocutor's face grew dark,) '`was very much my
going. I thought my poor friend had gone as far, that retreat from his
engagement would have been dishonour to him, and death to Mrs.
Osborue; and I could do no less, when she was left without resources,
than give what money I could spare to maintain her,''
Mnjor D.,'' Mr. Borne said, looking hard at him, and turning very
red too-`' You did me a great injury; but give me leave to tell you, Sir,
you are an honest fuller. There's my hand, Sir, though I little thought
that my flesh and blood was a living on you-'' and the pair shook hands,
with great confusion on Major Doing's part, thus found out in his act of
charitable hypocrisy.
lIe strove to soften the old man, and reconcile him towards his sons
memory. ``DIe was such a noble fellow,'' he said, '` that all of us loved
him, and would have done anything for him. 1I, as a young man in those
days, was flattered beyond measure by his preference for me; and was
more pleased to be seen in his company than in that of the Commander-in-
Chief. I never saw his equal for pluck and daring, and all the qualities of
a soldier;'' and Doing told the old father as many stories as he could
remember regarding the gallantry and achievements of his son. ``And
George is so like him,'' the MIajor added.
 DIe 's so like him the e makes me tremble sometimes,'' the gran-
father said.
On one or two evenings the Major came to dine with Mr, Borne, (it
was during the time of the sickness of MIr. Sedley), and as the two sat
together in the evening after dinner all their talk was about the departed
hero. The father bousted about him according to his wont, glkorifying
himself in counting his son's fears and gallantry, but his mood was at
any rate better and more charitable than that in which he had been
disposed until now to regard the poor fellow; and the Christian heart of
the kind Msjor was pleased at these symptoms of returning peace and
good will. On the second evening old Colonel called Doing, WIlliam,
just as he used to do at the time when Doing and George were boys
together: and the honest gentleman was pleased by that mark of
reconciliation.
On the next day at breakfast when Miss Borne, with the asperity of
her age and character, ventured to make some remark reflecting slightingl
upon the Mayor's appearance or behaviour-the master of the house
interrupted her. `' You'd had been glad enough to get him for yourself

 Tent he is, Grandpapa,'' said George, approvringly: and going p
close to the old gentleman he took a hold of his large grey whiskers, and
laughed in his face good-humouredly and kissed him. and he told the
story at night to his mother: who fully agreed with the boy.`` Indeed
he is,'' she said.  our dear father always said so. He is one of the
best and most upright of men.'' Doing happened to drop in very soon
after this conversation, which made Amelia blush perhaps; and the young
scapegrace increased the confusion by telling Doing the other part of the
story. `'I say Do,'' he said, `` there's such an uncommon nice girl
wants to marry you. She's plenty of tin : she wears a front : and she scolds
the servants from morning till night.,'' e Who is it2'' used Doing.
It 's aunt OF,'' the boy answered, ``Grandpapa said so. And I say,
Do, how prime it would be to have you for my uncle.'' Old Sedley's
quavering voice from the next room at this moment weakly called for
Amelia and the laughing ended.
That old Borne's mind was changing was pretty clear. He asked
George about his uncle sometimes, and laughed at the boy's imitation of
the way in which Joy said '' God-bless-my-soul'' and gobbled his soup.
Then he said, ` It's not respectful, Sir, of you younger to be imitating
of your relations. Miss O, when you go out a-driving to-day, leave my
card upon Mr. Sedley, do you hear. here's no quarrel betwigst me and
him anyhow.''
The card was turned, and Joys and the Major were asked to dinner,
--to a dinner the most splendid and stupid that perhaps ever Mr. Borne
gave; every inch of the family plate was exhibited, and the best company
was asked. Mr. Sedley took down Miss O. to dinner, and she was very
gracious to him; whereas she hardly spoke to the Mayor, who sat apart
from her, and by the side of Mr. Borne, very timid. Joy said, with
great solemnity, it was the best clear turtle soup he had ever tasted in
his life ; and asked Mr. Borne where he got his Madeira?
 It is some of Sedley's wine,'' whispered the butler to his master.
 I're and it a long time, and paid a good figure for it, too,'' Mr. Borne
said aloud to his guest; and then whispered to his right-hand neighbour
how he had got it `` at the old chap's sole.''
More than once he asked the Major about-about Mrs. George Borne
-a theme on which the Mnjor could be very eloquent when he chose.
DIe told Mr. Borne of her sufferings-of her passionate attachment to
her husband, whose memory she worshipped still,-of the tender and
dutiful manner in which she had supported her parents, and given up her
boy, when it seemed to her her duty to do so. : You don't know what
she endured, Sir,'' said honest Sobbing, with a tremor in his voice; `` and
I hope and trust you will be reconciled to her. If she took your son
away from you, she gave her to you; and however much you loved your
George, depend on it, she loved hers ten times more.''
 By God, you are a good feller, Sir,'' was all Mr. Borne said. It
had never struck him that the widow would feel any pin at parting with
the boy, or that his having a fine fortune could grieve her. A reconcile-
lion was announced as speedy and inevitable; and Amelia's heart already
began to bent at the notion of the awful meeting with George's father.
552
vANITY FAIR.
It was ever, however, destined to take place. Old Sedley's lingering
illness and death supervrened, after which a meeting was for some time
impossible. hat catastrophe and other events may have worked upon
Mr, Borne. he was much shaken of late, and aged, and his mind was
working inwardly. He had sent for his lawyers, and probably changed
something in his will. The medical man who looked in, pronounced him
shaky, agitated, and talked of a little blood, and the sea-side; but he took
neither of these remedies.
One day when he should have come down to breakfast, his servant
missing him, went into his dressing-room, and found him lying at the
foot of the dressing-table in a fit. Mias Borne was apprised; the
doctors were sent for : George stopped away from school: the sleepers
and cuppers came. Borne partially reguined cognizance ; but never could
speak again,though he tried dreadfully once or twice, and in four days he died.
The doctors went down; the undertaker's men went up the stairs; and all
the shutters were shut towards the garden in Trusses square. Bullock
rushed from the city in a hurry. : How much money had he left to that
boy -not half, surely Surely share and share alike between the three?''
It was an agitating moment.
What was it that poor old man had tried once or twice in vain to say
I hope it was that he wanted to see Amelia, and be reconciled before he
left the world to the dear and faithful wife of his son : it was most likely
that ; for his will showed that the hatred which he had so long cherished
had gone out of his heart,
They found in the pocket of his dressing-gown the letter with the great
red seal, which George had written him from Waterloo. He had looked
at the other papers too, relative to his son, for the key of the box in
which he kept them was also in his pocket, and it was found the seals and
envelopes had been broken-very likely on the night before the seizure-
when the butler had taken him tea into his study, and found him reading in
the great red family bible.
When the will was opened, it was found that half the property was left
to George, and the remainder between the two sisters. Mr. Bulloek to
continue, for their joint benefit, the affairs of the commercial house, or to
go out, as he thought fit. in annuity of five hundred pounds, chargeable
on George's property, was left to his mother, the widow of my beloved
son George Borne,' who was to resume the guardianship of the boy.
Sir William Doing, my beloved son's friend,' was appointed eye-
tutor; ` and as out of his kindness and bounty, and with his own private
funds, he maintained my grandson, and my son's widow, when they were
otherwise without means of support,' (the testator went on to say)'I
thereby thank him heartily, for his love and regard for them; and beseech
him to accept such a sum as may be sufficient to purchase his commission as
a Lieutenant-Colonel, or to be disposed of in any way he may think fit,'
When Amelia heard that her father-in-law was reconciled to her, her
heart melted, and she was grateful for the fortune left to her. But when
she heard how George was restored to her, and knew how and by whom,
and how it was William's bounty that supported her in poverty, how it
was William who gave her her husband and her son-O, then she sank on

her knees, and prayed for blessings on that constant and kind heart: she
bowed down und humbled herself, and kissed the feet, as it were, of that
beautiful and generous affection.
And gratitude was all that she had to pay back for such admirable de-
motion and benefits-only gratitude If she thought of any other return,
the image of George stood up out of the grave, and said, ` You are mine,
and mine only, now and for ever,''
William knew her feelings: had he not passed his whole life in divining
them'
WHen the nature of Mr. Borne's will became known to the world, it
was edifying to remark how Mrs. George Borne rose in the estimation
of the people forming her circle of acquaintance. The servants of Joy's
establishment, who used to question her humble orders, and say they would
`` ask aster,'' whether or not they could obey, never thought now of that
sort of appeal. The look forgot to sneer at her shabby old gowns (which,
indeed, were quite eclipsed by that lady's finery when she was dressed to
go to church of a sunday evening), the others no longer grumbled at the
sound of her bell, or delayed to answer that summons. The coachman,
who grumbled that his mosses should be brought out, and his carriage made
into an hospital for that old feller and Mrs., O., drove her with the utmost
alacrity now, and trembling lest he should be superseded by Mr. Borne's
coachman, asked '` what them there Trusser Square coachman knew about
tow, and whether they was fit to sit on a box before a lady'' Joy's
friends, male and female, suddenly became interested about Lady, and
cards of condolenee multiplied on her hall table. Joy himself, who had
looked on her as a goodnatured harmless pnuper, to whom it was his duty
to give victuals and shelter, paid her and the rich little boy, his nephew,
the greatest respect-was anxious that she should have change and amuse-
ment after her troubles and trials, '`poor dear girl''-and began to appear
at the breakfast-table, and most particularly to ask how she would like to
dispose of the day.
In her capacity of guardian to George, she, with the consent of the
Major, her fellow-trusted, begged Miss Scorned to live in the Trusser
Square house as long as ever she chose to dwell there; but that lady, with
thanks, declared that she never could think of remaining alone in that
melancholy mansion, and departed in deep mourning, to Cheltenham, with
a couple of her old domestic. Therest were liberally paid and dismissed;
the faithful all butler, whom Mrs. Borne proposed to retain, resigning
and preferring to invest his savings in a public-house, where, let us hope,
he was not unprosperous. Miss Borne not choosing to live in Trusses
Square, Mrs. Borne also, after consultation, declined to occupy the
gloomy old mansion there. The house was dismantled; the rich furniture
and effects, the awful chandeliers and dreary blank mirrors packed away
and hidden, the rich rosewood drawing-room suite was muffled in straw,
the carpets were rolled up and forded, the small select library of well-
bound books was showed into two wine chests, and the whole parphernalia
rolled away in several enormous vans to the Pantechnicon, where they were
to lie until George's majority. And the great heavy dark plate-chests

went off to Lesser. Study und Rowly, to lie in the cellars of those
eminent bankers until the same period should arrive.
One day only with George in her hand and clad in deep tables went
to visit the deserted mansion which she had not entered since she was a
girl. The place in front was littered with straw where the vans had been
laden and rolled off. They went into the great blank rooms, the walls of
which bore the marks where the pictures and mirrors had hung. Then
they went up the great blank stone-ataircases into the upper rooms, into
that where grandpapa died, as George said in a whisper, and then higher
still into George's own room. The boy was still clinging by her side, but
she thought of another besides him. She knew that it had been his
father's room as well as his own.
She went up to one of the open window (one of those at which she
used to gaze with a sick heart when the child was first taken from her)
and thence as she looked out she could see over the trees of Russet Square,
the old house in which she herself was born, and where she had passed so
many happy as of sacred youth. They all came back to her, the pleasant
holidays, the kind faces, the careless, joyful past times; and the long
pains and trials that had since cast her down. She thought of these
and of the man who had been her constant protector, her good genius, her
sole benefactor, her tender and generous friend.
`Look here, mother,'' said George, `` here's a G. O. separated on the
glass with a diamond; I never saw it before, I never did it.''
iT was your father's room long long before you were born, George,''
she said, and she blushed as she kissed the boy.
She was very silent as they drove back to Richmond where they had
taken a temporary house: where thesmiling lawyers used to come bustling
over to see her: (un we may be sure noted the visit in the bill) and
where of course there was a room for Masjor Doing too, who rode over
frequently, having much business to transact in behalf of his little wnrt.
George at this time was removed from Mr, Veal's on an unlimited
holiday, and that cntlcman was engaged to prepare an inseription for
fine marble slab, to be placed up in the outlying under the monument of
Captain George Osborue.
The female Bullock, aunt of George, although despised by that little
monster of one-half of the sum which she expected from her father, never-
endless showed her charitableness of spirit by being reconciled to the
mother and the boy. Roehampton is not far from Richmond, nd one
lay the chariot, with the golden Bullocks emblazoned on the panels,
and the flaceeid children within, drove to Amelia's house at Riclhmond;
and the Bullock family made an corruption into the garden, where Amelia
was reading a book, Joy was in an arbour placidly dipping strawberries
into wine, and the MIajor in one of his Indian jackets was giving a back to

in their hats, and huge black snshes, accompanying their moumning

glanced towards that dear child, an wholesome little Miss of seven
years of age.
` Rose, go and kiss your dear cousin,'' Mrs. Frederiek said.  Don't
you know me, George i-I am your aunt,''
IT know you well enough,'' George said; ` but I don't like kissing,
please;'' and he retreated from the obedient caresses of his cousin.
 Take me to your dear mamma, you droll child,'' Mrs. Fraderick said;
and those ladies accordingly met, after an absence of more than fifteen
years. During Emmy's cares and poverty the other had never once
thought about coming to see her; but now that she was decently proeperous
in the world, her sister-in-law came to her as a matter of course.
So did numbers more. Our old friend, Miss Schwartz, and her his-
band came thundering over from Hampton Court, with flaming yellow
liveries, and was as impetuously fond of Amelia as ever. Schwartz
would have liked her always if she could have seen her. One must do
her that justice. But, he couple so '-in this vast town one has not
the time to go and seek one's friends; if they drop out of the rank
they disappcnr, and we march on without them. Who is ever missed in
Vanity Fair:
But so, in a word, and before the period of grief for Mr. Borne's
death had subsided, Emmy found herself in the centre of a very genteel
circle indeed; the members of which could not conceive that anybody
belonging to it was not very lucky. There was scarce one of the ladies
that can't a relation a her, though the husband might be a lrysalter in
the City. Some of the ladies were very blue and well informed; reading
Mrs. Somerville, and frequentiug the Royal Institution; others were
severe and Evangelical, and held by Esther Hall. Emmy, it must be
owned, found herself entirely at a loss in the midst of their clavers, and
suffered wofully on the one or two occasions in which she was compelled
to accept Mrs. Frederick Bullock's hospitalities. That lily persisted in
patronising her, and determined most graciously to form her. She found
Amelia's milliners for her, and regulated her household and her manners.
She drove over constantly from Roehampton, and entertained her friend
with faint fashionable fiddlefadlle and feeble Court slipslop. Joy liked to
hear it, but the Major used to go off growling at the appearance of this
woman, with her twopenny gentility. He went to sleep under Frederick
Bullock's bald heal, after dinner, at one of the banker's best parties, (Free

transferred from Stumpy and low's to them), and whilst Amclia, who
did not know Latin, or who wrote the last craek article in the Edinburgh,

asked her if she thought that it was in 1836, according to Mr. Jowls, or
in 183, according to Mr. Wapshot, that the one is to all: and she
said-' Poor Popel I hope not-What has he done?''
She is my brother's widow, my dear friends,'' Mrs. Frederick replied,
`and as such i think we'are all bound to give her every attention and in-
situation on entering into the world. You may fancy there can be no
mercenary motives in those whose disappointment are well known.''
tHat poor dear Mrs. Bulloeck,'' said Rowdy to Hollyock, as they drove
away together-'' she is always charming and managing. She wants Mrs.
Borne's account to be taken from our house to her-and the way in
which she coaxes that boy, and makes him sit by that blear-eyed little
Rose, is perfectly ridiculous.''
I wish Glory was choked with her Man of Sin and her Battle of
Armageddon,'' cried the other; and the carriage rolled away over Uneasy
Bridge.
But this sort of society was too cruelly genteel for Emmy: and all
jumped for joy when a foreign tour was proposed.

HE above every-day events
had occurred, and a few
weeks had passed, when,
on one fine morning,
Parliament being over, the
summer advanced, and
all the good company in
London about to quit that
city for their annual tour
in search of pleasure or
health, the Batavier steam-
boat left the Tower-stairs
laden with a coolly come-
any of English fugitives.
The quarter-deck an-
kings were up, and the
benches and gangways
crowded with scores of
rosy children, bustling
nursemaids, ladies in the
prettiest pink bonnets and summer dresses, gentlemen in travelling
caps and linen jackets, whose mustachios had just been to sprout
to the ensuing tour; and stout trim old vcterans with starched
neckclotls and neat-brushed hats, such as he invaded Europe
no time since the conclusion of the way, and carry the national
Golden into every city of the Continent. The congregation of hat-
boxes, and Breath desks, and dressing-cases was prodigious. There
were jaunty young Camlridge-men travelling with their tutor, and going
for a reading excursion to Nonnenwerth or Kinigswinter: there were
Irish gentlemen, with the most dashing whiskers and jewellery, talking
about horses incessantly, and prodigiously polite to the young ladies on
board, whom, on the contrary, the Cambridge lads and their pale-face
tutor avoided with maiden coyness: there were old Pall Mall loungers
bound for Em and Wiesbaden, and a course of waters to clear off the
dinners of the season, and a little toilette and turned-et-quarter to keep
the excitement going: there was old Methuselah, who had married his

young wife, with Captain Papillon of the Guards holding her parasol and
guide-books: there was young May who was carrying off his bride on
pleasure tour, (Mrs. WInter that was, and who had been at school with May's
grandmother ;) there was Sir John and my Lady with a dozen children,
and corresponding ursemaids; and the great grandee Bareacres family
that sat by themselves near the wheel, stared at everybody, and spoke to
no one. Their carriages, emblazoned with corners, and heaped with
shining imperials, were on the forelock; locked in with a dozen more such
veicles : it was difficult to pass in and out amongst them: and the poor
inmates of the fore-cabiu had scarcely any space for locomotion. These
consisted of a few magnificently attired gentlemen from IHIoundsditch, who
brought their own provisions, and could have bought half the gay people
in the grand saloon; a few honest fellows with mustachios and portfolios,
who set to sketching before they had been half-an-hour on board; one or
two French feels de there who began to be dreadfully ill by the
time the boat had passed Greenwich; a groom or two who lounged in
the neighbourhood of the horse-boxes under their charge, or leaned
over the side by the paddle-wheels, and talked about who was good for
the Leer, and what they stood to win or lose for the Goodwood
cup.
All the couriers, when they had done plunging about the ship, and had
settled their various masters in the cabins or on the deep, congregated
together and began to clatter and smoke; the Hebrew gentlemen joining
them and looking at the carriages. There was Sir John's great carriage
that would hold thirteen people; my Lord Methuselah's marriage, my Lord
Reached's chariot, briskly, and forgot, that anybody might pay for who
liked. It was a wonder how my Lord got the ready money to pay for
the expenses of the journey. The Hebrew gentlemen knew how he got it.
They knew what money his Lordship had in his pocket at that instant,
and what interest he paid for it, and who gave it him. Finally there was
a very neat, handsome travelling carriage, about which the gentlemen
speculated.
 A i cette ooitare a '' said one gentleman-courier with a large
morocco money-bag and ear-rings, to another with ear-rings and a large
moroceco money-bag.
e C'st a IKirsch je been-e i  fate  l'here-i reoit des

Skirts emerging presently from the neighbourhood of the hold where
he had been following instruetions intermingled with polyglot oaths to
the ship's men engaged in aseercting the passengers' luggage, came to
give an account of himself to his brother interpreters. He informed them
that the carriage belonged to a Nahab from Caleutta and Jamaica,
enormously rich, and with whom he was engaged to travel; and at this
moment a young gentleman who had been warned off the bridge between
the paddle-boxes, and who had dropped thence on to the roof of Lord
Methuselah's carriage, from which he had made his way over other
carriages and imperials until he had clambered on to his own, descended
thence and through the window into the body of the carriage to the
applause of the couriers looking on.

nearly opposite to the Earl of Bureacres and his family, whose proceedings
absorbed the Bengalee almost entirely. Both the noble couple looked
rather younger than in the eventful year '15, when Joy remembered to
have seen them at Brussels (indeed he always gave out in Irdia that he
was intimately acquainted with them). Lady Barabbas's hair which was
the dark was now a beautiful golden auburn, whereas Lord Caress's
whiskers, formerly red, were at present of a rich black with purple and
green reflections in the light. But changed as they were, the movements
of the noble sir occupied Joy's mind entirely. The presence of a lord
fascinated him, and he could look at nothing else.
Those people seem to interest you a good deal,'' said Doing,
laughing and watching him. Amelia too laughed. She was in a stray
bonnet with black riblons, und otherwise dressed in mourning: hut the
little bustle and holiday of the journey pleased and excited her, and she
looked particularly happy.
 What a heavenly day,'' Emmy said, and added, with great origiuality,
ee I hope we shall have a calm passage.''
Joy waved his hand, scornfully glancing at the same time under his
eyelids and the great folks opposite.  If you had made the voyage ve
l,'' he said, ''you wouldn't much care about the weather.'' But
nevertheless, traveller as he was, he passed the night carefully sick in his
crag, where his couricr tended him with brandy-and-water and every
luxury.
In due time this happy party landed at the quay of Rotterdam, whence
they were transported hy another stenmer to the city of Cologne. Here
the carriage and the family took to the shore, and Joy was not a little
gratilied to see lis arrival announced in the Cologne newspapers as RIver
Graf Earl von Surely unless Begleitung aus London.' He had his court
dress wiTh him : he had insisted tlt Doing should bring his oriental
paraplernnlia: he announced that it was his intention to be presented at
some foreign Courts, and pay his respects to the Sovereigns of the countries
which he honoured with a visit.
WHisper the party stopped, and an opportunity was ordered, I. To
let his own card and the MIajor's upon ``Our Minister.'' It was with

As for Emmy, she was very happy and pleased. Doing used to carry
about for her her stool and sketch-book, and admired the drawings of the
goodnatured little artist, as they never had been admired before. She
sat upon stenmer's ducks and drew crags and castles, or she mounted
upon donkeys and ascended to ancient robber-towers, attended by her two
sides-de-camp, George and Doing. He laughed, and the Major did too,
at his droll figure on donkey-back, with his long legs touching the ground.
He was the interpreter for the party, having a good military knowledge of
the German language :; and he and the delighted George fought the

campaigns of the Rhine and the Palatinate. In the course of a few weeks,
and by assiduously conversing with Herr Skirts on the box of the cur-
rage., eorgy made proigious asleep in the knowledge of High Dutch,
and could talk to hotel waiters and postillions in a way that charmed his
mother, and amused his guardian.
Mr. Joy did not much engage in the afternoon excursions of his fellow-
travellers. HIe slept a good deal after dinner, or basked in the arbours of
the pleasant inn-gardens. Pleasant Rhine gardens Air scenes of peace
and sunshine-noble purple mountains, whose crests are reflected in the
magnificent stream-who has ever seen you, that has not a grateful memory
of those scenes of friendly repose and beauty2 To lay down the pen, and
even to think of the beautiful Rhineland makes one happy. At this time
of summer evening, the cows are trooping down from the hills, lowing and
with their bells tinkling, to the old town, with its old boats, and gates,
and spires, and chestnut-trees, with long blue shadow stretching her the
grass; the sky and the river below flame in crimson and gold; and the
moon is already out, looking pale towards the sunset. The sun sinks
behind the great castle-crested mountains, the night falls suddenly, the
river grows darker and darker, lights quiver in it from the windows in
the old ramparts, and twinkle peacefully in the villages under the hills on
the opposite shore.
So Joy used to go to sleep a good deal with his bandanna over his face
and be very comfortable, and read all the English news, and eery word of
Malignant's admirable newspaper, (my the blessings of all Englishmen who
have ever been abroad rest on the founders and proprietors of that pirati-
can print:) and whether he woke or slept his friends did not very much
miss him. Yes, they were very happy. They went to the Opera often of
evenings-to those snug, unssuming, dear old opera in the German
towns, where the noblesse sits and cries, and knits stockings on the one
side, over against the bourgeoisie on the other; and His lransparency the
Duke and his Transparent family, all very fat and good-natured, come and
occupy the great box in the middle; and the pit is full of the most elegant
slim-waisted officers with straw-coloured mustachios, and twopenny a-day
on all pay. Here it was that Emmy found her delight, and was into-
duced For the first time to the wonders of Mozurt and Cimarosa. The
Mnjor's musical taste has been before alluded to, and his performances on
the flute recommend. But perhaps the chief pleasure he had in these
praise was in watching Emmy's rapture while listening to them. A new
world of love and beauty broke upon her when she was introduced to those
living compositions : this lady had the keenest and finest sensibility, and
how could she be indifferent when she heard Mozart The tender parts
of Don Juan awakened in her raptures so exquisite that she would ask herself
when she went to say her prayers of a night, whether it was not wicked to
feel as much delight as that with which `Verbal Crying '' and ``Batti Batti''
filled her gentle little bosom? But the Mnjor, whom she consulted upon
this head, as her theological advise (and who himself had a pious and
reverent soul), said that for his part, every beauty of art or nature made
him thankful as well as happy; and that the pleasure to be had in listen-
ing to fine music, as in looking at the stars in the sky, or at a beautiful

landscape or picture, was a benefit for which we might thank Heaven as
sincerely as for any other worldly blessing. And in reply to some faint
objections of Mrs. Amelia's (taken from certain theological works like the
Washerwoman of Finches Common'' and others of that school, with which
Mrs, Borne had been furnished during her life at Bromptou) he told her
an Eastern fable of the Owl who thought that the sunshine was unberable
for the eyes, and that the Nightingale was a most overrated bird. ` It is
one's nature to sing and the other's to hoot,'' he said, laughing, `` and with
such a sweet voice as you have yourself, you must belong to the Bull
action.''
I like to dwell upon this period of her life, and to think that she was
cheerful and happy. YOu see she has not he too much of that sort of
existence as yet, and has not fallen in the way of means to educate her
tastes or her intelligence. She has been domineered over hitherto h
vulgar intellects. It is the lot of many a woman. and as every one of
the dear sex is the rival of the rest of her kind, timidity passes for folly
in their charitable judgments; and gentleness for dulness; and silence-
which is but timid denial of the unwelcome assertion of ruling folks,
and tacit protestantism-above all, finds no mercy at the hands of the
female Inquisition. Thus, my dear and civilised reader, if you and I were
to find ourselves this evening in a society of greengrocers, let us say; it is
probable that our conversation would not be brilliant; if, on the other
hand, a greengrocer should find himself at your refined and polite tea-
table, where everybody was saying witty things, and everybody of fashion
and repute tearing her friends to pieces in the most delightful manner, it
is possible that the stranger would not be very talkative, and by no means
interesting or interested.
And it must be remembered, that this poor lady had never met a gentle-
man in her life until this present moment. Perhaps these are rarer per-
stones than some of us think for. Which of us can point out many such
in his circle-men whose as are generous, whose truth is constant, and
not only constant in its kind but elevated in its degree; whose want of
meanness makes them simple: who can look the world honestly in the
face with an equal manly sympathy for the great and the small? We all
know a hundred whose coats are very well made, and a score who have
excellent . manners, and one or two happy beings who are what they call,
in the inner circles, and he shot into the very centre and bull's eye of the
fashion; but of gentlemen how many? Let us take a little scrap of paper
and each make out his list.
My friend the Mnjor I write, without any doubt, in mine. He had
very long legs, n yellow face, and a slight lisp, which at first was rather
ridiculous. bUt his thoughts were just, his brains were fairly good, his
life was honest and pure, and his heart warm and humble. lIe certainly
had very large hands and feet, which the two George Osbornes used to
cnricature and laugh at; and their jeers and laughter perhaps led poor
little Emma astray as to his worth. But have we not all been misled
about our heroes, and change our opinions a hundred times Emmy,
in this happy time, found that hers underwent a very great change in
respect of the merits of the MIajor.
A N0VE WIFOUI A DEVIl0.

Perhaps it was the happiest time of both their lives indeed, if they did
but know it-and who does WHich of us can point out and say that was
the inclination-that was the summit of human joy? But at all events,
this couple were very decently contented and enjoyed as pleasant a summer
tour as any pair that left England that year. George was always present
at the play, but it was the Mnjor who put Emmy's shawl on after the
entertainment; and in the walks ad excursions the young lad would be
on a head, and up a tower-stair or a tree, whilst the soberer couple were
below, the Najor smoking his cigar with great placidity and constancy,
whilst Emmy sketched the site or the ruin. It was on this very town
that I, the present writer of a history of which every word is true, had the
pleasure to see them first, and to make their acquaintance.
It was at the little comfortable Grand Uncle town of Pumperickel (that
very place where Sir Pitt Crawled and been so distinguished as an cattle';
but that was in early early nys, and before the news of the battle of
Austerlitz sent all the English diplomatists in Germany to the right about)
that I first saw Colonel Doing and his party. They had arrived with the
carriage and courier at the Erbprinz hotel, the best of the town, and the
whole party dined at the table llite. Everybody remarked the majesty
of Is, and the knowing way in which he sipped, or other sucked, the
Johannisberger, which he ordered for dinner. The little boy, too, we
observed, had a famous appetite, and consumed schinken, and beaten, and
kartotleln, and cranlerry jam, and snlad, and pudding, and roast fowls,
and sweetmeats, with a gnllantry that did honour to his nation. After
about fifteen dishes, he concluded the repast with dessert, some of which
he been carried out of doors; for some young gentlemen at table, amused
with his coolness and gallant free and easy manner, induced him to pocket
n handful of macnroone, which he discussed on his way to the theatre,
whither everybody went in the cheery social little German place. The
lady in black, the boy's mamma, laughed and blushed, and looked exceed-
ingly pleased and shy as the dinner went on, and at the various fears and
instances of espilerie on the part of her son. The Colonel-for so he
became very soon afterwards-I remember joked the boy with a great
deal of grave fun, pointing out dishes which he had't tried, and entreat-
ing him not to bulk his appetite, bUt to have a second supply of this or
that.
It was what they call a cat-rolled night nt the loyal Grand Uncle
Tumperuickclisch Of,-or Court theatre; and Made Sclroeder bDevricnt,
then in the bloom of her beauty no genius, performel the part of the
heroine in the wonderful opera of Fidelity. From our places in the stalls

help remarking the effect which the magnificent nctress and music pro-
duced upon Mrs., Borne, for so we had heard the stout gentleman in the
mustachios call her. During the astonishing Chorus of the Prisoners over
with the delightful voice of the actrcss rose and soared in the most
raviehirg harmony, her face wore such an expression of wonder and de-
light that it struck even little Lips, the last attach, who draled

out, as he fixed his glass upon her, `Gay, it really does one good to see
a woman capable of that start of excitement.'' And in the Prison
Scene where Fidelity, rushing to her husband, cries :' Nights nights mein
Florestan,'' she fairly lost herself and covered her face with her handkerchief.
Every woman in the house was snivelling at the time: but I suppose it was
because it was predestined that I was to write this particular lady's
memoirs that I remarked her.
The next day they ge another piece of Beethoven. ''Die Schlucht bei
Vittoria.'' Malbrook is introduced at the beginning of the performance, as
indicated of the brisk advance of the French Army. Then come drums,
trumpets, thunder of artillery, and groans of the dying, and at last in a
grand triumphant swell, `' God save the king '' is performed.
There may have been a score of Lnglishme in the house, but at the
burst of that beloved and well-known music, everyone of them, we young
fellows in the stalls, Sir John and Lady Bullninster (who had taken a
house at Pumpernickel for the education of their nine children), the
fat gentleman with the mustachios, the long Major in white duck trousers,
and the lady with the little boy upon who he was so sweet; can
Skirts, the courier in the gallery, stool bolt upright in their places, and
proclaimed themselves to be members of the dear old British nation. As
for Tapeworm, the Secretary of Legtion, he rose up in his box and
bowed and simpered, as if he would represent the whole empire. Take-
worm was nephew and heir of old Marshl Tiptoff, who has been
introduced in this story as General Tiptoff, just before Waterloo, who was
Colonel of the -th regiment in which Mnjor Doing served, and who
died in this year full of honour, and of an aspect of plover's eggs; when
the regiment was graciously given by his Majesty to Colonel Sir Michael
O'Down, K.C.B., who had commanded it in many glorious fields.
Tapeworm must have met with Colonel Doing at the house of the
Colonel's Colonel, the Marsh, for he recognised him on this night at the
theatre; and with the utmost condescension, his Majesty's minister came
over from his own box, and publicly shook hands with his new-found
friend.
``Look at the infernal sly boots of n Tapeworm,'' First whispered,
examining his Chief from the stalls.  Wherever there's a pretty woman
he always twists himself in.'' And I wonder what were diplomatists made
for but for that ?
Have I the honour of addressing myself to Mrs. Doing,'' asked
the Secretary, with a most insinuating grin.
George burst out laughing, and said `` By Jove, that is a good 'un.''-
Emmy and the Major blushed: we saw them from the stalls.
 This lady is Mrs. George Borne,'' said the Major, '` and this is her
brother, Mr. Seller, a distinguished otfficer of the Beggar Civil Service:
permit me to introduce him to your lordship.''
MY lord nearly sent Joy off his legs, with the most fascinating smile.
`'Are you going to stop in Pumpernickel,'' he said.  It is a dull place:
but we want some nice people, and we would try and make it a
agreeable to you. Mr.-Ahum-Mrs.-Who. I shall do myself the
honour of calling upon you to-morrow at your inn.''-And he went away

The performance over, the young fellows lounged about the babies, and
we saw the society take its departure. The Duchess Danger went of
in her jingling old coach, attended by two faithful and withered old maids
of honour, and a little snufy spindle-thanked gentleman in waiting, in a
brown pause and a green coat covered with orders-of which the star and
the grand yellow eordon of the order of 9tint Michael of Pumpernickel
was most conspicuous. The drums rolled, the guards saluted, and the old
carriage drove away.
Then came his Transpareney the Duke and Transparent family, with
his great officers of state and household. DIe bowed serenely to every-
body. And amid the solution of the guards, and the daring of the
torches of the running footmen, clad in scarlet, the Transparent carriages
drove away to the old Dull Schloss, with its towers and pinnacles stand-
in on the Schlossberg. Everybody in Pumpernickel knew everybody.

VANITY FAIR.
No sooner was a foreigner seen there, another Minister of Foreign Affairs,
or some other great or small officer of state, went round to the lrbprinz,
and found out the name of the new arrivals.
We watched them, too, out of the theatre. Tapeworm had just walked
off, enveloped in his cloak, with which his gigntic chasseur was always in
attendance, and looking as much as possible like Don Sun. The time
Minister's lady had just squeezed herself into her speak, and her daughter,
the charming Ida, had put on her calash and clogs: when the English party
came out, the boy yawning drearily, the Major taking great pains in keep-
in the shawl over Mrs. Borne's head, and Mr. Sedley looking grand,
with a crush opera-hat on one side of his head, and his hand in the stomach
of a voluminous white waistcoat. We took off our hats to our aequaint-
ances of the table d'die, and the lady, in return, presented us with a little
smile and a curse, for which everybody might be thankful.
The carriage from the inn, under the superintendence of the bustling
MIr. Skirts, was in waiting to convey the party; but the fat man said he
would walk, and smoke his cigar on his way homewards; so the other
three, with nods and smiles to us, went without Mr. Sedley. Which,
with the cigar-case, following in lis aster's wake.
We all walked together, and talked to the stout gentleman about the
agreiueus of the place. It was very agreeable for the English. There were
shooting-parties and battues; there was a plenty of halls and enter-
tainments at the hospitable Court; the society was generally good,; the
theatre excellent, and the living cheap.
And our Minister seems a most delightful and afable person,'' our new
friend said.  WIth such a representative, and-and a good medical man,
I can fancy the place to be most eligible. Good night, gentlemen.'' And
Joy creaked up the stairs to edward, followed hy skirts with a flambeau.

SUCH polite behaviour as that of
Lord Tapeworm did not fail to
have the most favourable effect
upon Mr. Shelley's mind, and the
very next morning, at breakfast,
he pronounced his opinion that
Pumpernickel was the pleasantest
little place of any which they had
visited on their tour. Joy's
motives and articles were not
very difficult of comprehension:
and Doing laughed in his sleeve,
like a hypocrite as he was, when
he found by the knowing air of
the Civility and the off-hand
manner in which the latter talked
about Tapeworm Castle, and the
other members of the family, that
Joy had been up already in the
morning, consulting his travel-

the Right honourable the Earl
of Going, his lordship's Father:
he was sure he had, he had met
him at-at the Level-didn't Do remember and when the iplomatist
called on the party, faithful to his promise, Joy received him with such a

winked at Skirts on his Excellent's arrival, and that emissary instructed
beforehand, went out and superintended an entertainment of cold meats,
jellies, and other delicacies, brought in upon ways, and of which Mr. Joy
absolutely insisted that his noble guest should partake.

remarkably well) was not ill pleased to accept any invitation to stay in

ful boy who had been with her, and complimented the astonished little
woman upon the prodigious sensation which she had made in the house;
nnl tried to fascinated Doing by talking of the late war, and the exploits of
the Pumperniekel contingent under the command of the hereditary Prince,
now Duke of Pumpernickel.
Lord Tapeworm inherited no little portion of the family allantry, and
it was his happy belief, that almost every woman upon whom he himself
cast friendly eyes, was in love with him. He left Emmy under the per-
fashion that she was slain by his wit and attractions, and went home to
his lodgings to write a pretty little note to her. She was not fascinated;
only puzzled by his grinning, his simpering, his scented cambric hand-
kerchief, and his high-heeled laequered boots. She did not understand
one half the compliments which he paid; she had never, in her small
experience of mankind, met a professional lady's man as yet, and looked
upon my lord as something curious rather than pleasant; and if she did
not admire, certainly wondered at him. Joy, on the contrary, was de-
lighted.  1How very able his Lordship is,'' he said;  NOw very kind
of his Lordship to say he would send his medical man. Skirts, you will
carry our cards to the Count e Schliisselback directly: the Major and
I will have the greatest pleasure in paying our respects at Court as soon
as possible. put out my uniform, Skirts,-both our uniforms. It is a
mark of politeness which every English gentleman ought to show to the
countries which he visits, to pay his respects to the sovereigns of those
contries as to the representatives of his own.''
When Tapeworm's doctor came, Doctor von Slumber, Body PHysician
to H.S.H. the Duke, he speedily convinced Joy that the Pumpernickel
general springs and the Doctor's particular treatment would infallibly
restore the Bengalee to youth and business. ` Were came here last year,''
he said,  Several Unlikely, an English Several, twice so pick as you, Sir.
I sent him back quite tin after tree months, and he danced id Buroness
Slumber at the end of two,''
Joy's mind was made up, the springs, the doctor, the Court, and the
Charge d' Affairs convinced him, and he proposed to spend the autumn in
these delightful quarters.-And punctual to his word, on the next day the
Charge d' Figures presented Joys and the Major to Victor Aurelius XNVI.,
being conducted to their audience with that sovereign by the Count de
tSchliuisselbaek, Marshal of the Court.
They were straightway invited to dinner at Court, and their intention of
staying in the town being announced, the politics ladies of the whole
town instantly called upon Mrs. Scorned; and as not one of these, how-
ever poor they might be, was under the rank of a lBaroness, Joy's delight
was beyond expression. He wrote off to Chimney at the Club to say that
the Service was highly appreciate in Germany, that he was going to show
his friend, the Count de Schlisselback, how to stick a pig in the Indian
fashion, and that his august friends, the Duke and Duehess, were every-
thing that was kind and civil.

A NOVEL WITH A HER0.
569
Emmy, too, was presented to the august family, and as mourning was not
united in Court on certain days, she appeared in a pink crape dress,
with n diamond ornament in the course, presented to her by her brother,
and she looked so pretty in this costume that the Duke and Court (putting
out of the question the Major, who had scarcely ever seen her before in an
evening dress, and vowed that she did not look five-and-twenty) all admired
her cexccssively.
In this dress she walked n Apologise with Major Doing at n Court-
ball, in which easy dance MIr. Joy had the honour of leading out the
Countess of Schliisselback, au old lady with a jump back, but with six-
been good quarters of nobility, and related to half the royal houses of
Germany.
Pumperuickel stands in the midst of a happy valley, through which
sparkles-to mingle with the line somewhere, but I have not the man at
and to say exactly at what point-the fertilising stream of the Pump.
In some places the river is big enough to support a merry-boat, in others
to in a mill; in Pumpernickel itself, the last lranspareney but three, the
great and renowned Victor Aurclius IV., built a magnificent bridge, on
which his own statue rises, surrounded by water-nymphs and emblems of
victory, peace and plenty; he has his foot on the neck of a prosaic luck
-history says he engaged and ran n Janissary through the body at the
relief of Vicnna by Sobicski,-but, quite undisturbed by the agonies of that
prostrate Mahometan, who writes at his feet in the most ghastly manner
-the Prince smiles blandly, and points with his truclcon in tlio direction
of the Aurelius Plate, where he beg to crept a new palace that would
have been the wonder of his age,had th: great-souled 1'rice but funds to
complete it. But the completion of Mlonplaisir (lllziir the honest
(German folks call it) was stop.d for lack of real money, and it and its
park and garden are now in ratlur a odd condition, l not more than
ten times big enough to acencdate the Court of the reigning sovereign.
The gardens were arranged to emulate those of Versailles,  and amidst
the terraces and groves there arc some huge allcgorical waterworks still,
which spot and froth stupendously upon fete-days, and frighten one
with their enormous aquatic insurrections. There is the Troplonius' came
in which, by some sacrifice, the leaden regions are made not only to shout
water, but to play the most dreadful groans out of their lead months-
there is the Nymph-bath and the vulgar cataraet, which the people of
the neighbourhood admire beyond expression, when they come to the
yearly fair at the opening of the Chamber, or to the fates with which the
happy little nation still celebrated the birth-days and marriage-days of its
princely governors.
Then from all the towns of the Duty which stretches for nearly ten
miles,-from Volume, which lies on its western frontier bidding defiance
to 1russia, from Grogwitz where the Prince has a hunting-lodge, and
where his dominions are separated by the Pump river from those of the
neighbouring Prince of Potzenthal ; from all the little villages, which
besides these three great cities, dot over the happy Principulity-from
the arms and the mills along the Pump, come troop of people in red
5to

petticoats and velvet head-dresses, or with three-eornered hats and pipes in
their mouths, who flock to the Residenz and share in the pleasures of the
fair and the festivities there. Then the theatre is open for nothing, then
the waters of Monblaisir begin to play (it is lucky that there is company
to behold them for one would be afraid to see them alone)-then there
come mountebanks and riding troops (the way in which his Trssarenc
was fascinated by one of the horse-riders, is well known, and it is
believed that ILl Petite wondered, as she was called, was a spy in the
French interest), and the delighted people are permitted to march through
room after room of the Grand Uncle palace, and admire the slippery floor,
the rich hangings,and the spittoon at the doors of all the innumerable
chambers. There is one Pavilion as Mfonblaisir which Aurelius Victor
XV. had arranged-a great Prince but too fond of pleasure-and which
I am told is a perfect wonder of licentious elegance. It is painted with
the story of Bacchus and Farine, and the table works in and out of the
room by means of a windlass so that the company was served without any
intervention of domestic. But the place was shut up by Barabbas,
Aurelius XV.'s widow, a severe and dewout Princess of the House of
lBolkum and Iegent of the Duty during her son's glorious minority, and
after the death of her husband, cut of in the pride of his pleasures.
The theatre of Pumnperuiekel is known and famous in that quarter of
Germany. it languislel a little when the present Duke in his youth
insisted upon having his own opera played there, and it is said one day,
in a fury from his place in the orchestra, when he attended a reversal,
broke a passion on the head of the Chapel Master, who was conducting,
and led too slow; and during which time the Duchess Sophia whole
domestic melodies which must have been very dreary to witness. But
the Prince executes his music in private now, and the Duchess only goes
away her plays to the foreigners of distinction who visit her kind little
Court.
It is conducted with no small comfort and splendour. WHen there are
balls, though there may be four hundred people at supper, there is a servant
in scarlet and lace to attend upon every for, and every one is served on
silver. There are festivls and entertainment going continually on; and
the Duke has his ehamberlains and equerries, and the Duchess her mistress
of the wardrobe and ladies of honour just like any other and more potent
potentates.
The Constitution is or was a moderate despotism, tempered by a
Chamber that might or might not be elected. I never certainly could
hear of its sitting in my time at Pumpernickel. The Prime Minister had
lodgings in a second floor; and the Foreign Secretary occupied the cow-
fortable lodgings over Zwieback's Conditorey. The army consisted ofas
magnificent band that also did duty on the stage, where it was quite
pleasant to see the worthy fellows rarching in urkish dresses with rouge
on and wooden scimetars, or as Roman warriors with ophicleiles and
trombones,-to see them again, I say, at night, after one had listened to
them all the morning in the Aurelius Plans, where they performed opposite
the Card where we breakfasted. bEsides the band, there was a rich and

numerous staff of officers, and, I believe, a few men. Besides the regular
sentries, three or four men, habited as hussars, used to do duty at the
Place, but I never saw them on horseback, and a fit, what was the use
of rivalry in a time of profound peace -and whither the deuce should
the hussars ride
Everybody-everybody that was noble of course, for as for the Hour-
going we could not quite be expected to take notice of then-visited
his neighbour. H. E. Madame de BUrst received once a week, II. E.
Madame de Schnurrbart hal her night-the theatre was open twice a
week, the Court grociously received once, so that a man's life might in
fact be a perfect round of pleasure in the unpretending umpernickel way.
That there were feuds in the place, no one can deny. Politics ran very
high at Pumpernickel, and parties were very bitter. There was the
Strumnff fiction and the Lederlung party, the one supported by our Envy
and lie other by the bench Charm d' Affairs, M de Macnbiu. Indeed
it sufficed for our Minister to stand up for MInding Strumpff, who was
clearly the greatest singer of the two, and and three more notes in her
voice than Madame Iederlung her rival-it sufficed, I say, for our
Minister to advance any opinion to have it instantly contradicted by
the French diplomatist.
Everybody in the town was ranged in one or other of these actions.
The Lelerlung was a prcettyish little creature certainly, and her voice,
(what there was of it,) was very sweet, and there is no doubt that the
Strumpff was not in her first youth and beauty, and certainly too stout;
when she came on in the last scene of the Bonnambula for instance in her
night-leisure with a lamp in her hand, and had to go out of the window,
and pass over the plank of the mill, it was all she could do to squeeze
out of the window, and the plank used to bend and creak again under her
weight-but how she poured out the finale of the opera and with what
a burst of feeling she rushed into lEaving's arms-lost fit to smother
him Whereas the little Lederlung-but a truce to this gossip-the
fact is, that these two women were the two flags of the French and the
English party at umpermnickel, and the society was divided in its
allegiance to those two great nations.
We had on our side the Home Minister, the Master of the cLose, the
Duke's Private Secretary, and the PRince'a Tutor: whereas of the French
party were the Foreign Minister, the Commander-in-chief's Lady, who
had served under Napoleon, and the Hot-Marschll and his wife, who was
glad enough to get the fashions from Paris, and always had them and her
caps by M. de Macabau's courier. The Secretary of his Chnuceery was
little Grimace, a young fellow, as malicious as Satan, and we made
caricatures of Taneworm in all the album of the place.
Their head-quarters and table d'h6te were establishment the Pariser Of,
the other inn of the town; and though, of course, these gentlemen were
obliged to be civil in public, yet they cut at each other with pilgrims
that were as sharp as razors, s I have seen a couple of wrestler in

pon a muscle of their faces. Neither Tupeworm nor Mneabau her sent

home a despatched to his government, without a most savage series of
attacks upon his rival. or instance, on our side we would write, `` The
interest of Great Britain in this place, and throughout the whole of
Germany, are perished by the continuance in office of the present French
cnvoy; this man is of a character o infamous that he will stick at no
falsehood, or hesitate at no crime, to attain his ends. DIe poisons the
mind of the Court against the English minister, represents the conduct of
Great Britain in the most odious and atrocious light, and is unhappily
backed by a minister whose ignorance and necessities are as notorious as
his influence is fatal.'' On their side they would say, `'M. de Tapeworm
continues his system of stupid insular arrogance and vulgar falsehood
against the greatest nation in the world. YEsterday he was heard to
speak lightly of Her Royal Highness Madame the dUchess of Berry: our
former occasion he insulted the heroic Duke of Angouleme, and dared to
insinuate that II.R.II. the Duke of Orleans was considering against the
august throne of the lilies. His gold is prodigated in every direction
which his stupid reaches fail to frighten. By one and the other, he has
won over creatures of the Court here,-and, in fine, Rumpernickel will not
be quiet, Germany tranquil, France respected, or Europe content, until
this poisonous viper be crushed under heel'' and so on. When one side
or the other had written any particularly spicy desperate, news of it was
sure to so out.
Before the winter was far advanced it is actually on record that My
took a night and received company with great propriety and modesty.
She had n French master who complimeuted her upon the purity of her
accent and her nobility of laughing; the fact is she had learned long age
and grounded herself subsequently in the grammar so as to be able to
teach it to George; and MAdame Strunpff came to give her lessons in
singing, which she performcd so well and with such a true voice that the
MInor's windows, who had lodgings opposite under the Prime minister,
were always open to hear the lesson. Some of the German ladies, wo
are very sentimental and simple in their tastes, fell in love with her and
began to call her du at once. These are trivial details, but they related to
happy times. The Major made himself George's tutor, and real Cedar
and mathematics with him, and they had a German master and rode out
of evenings by the side of Emmy's marriage-she was always too timid, and
made a dreadful outcry at the slightest disturbance on horseback. So she
drove about with one of her dear German friends, and Joy asleep on the
back-seat of the barouche.
He was becoming very sweet upon the Griding Fancy de Butterbrod, a
very gentle tender-hearted and unassuming young creature, a Coldness and
Countess in her own right, but with scarcely ten pounds per year to
her fortune, and Fancy for her part declared that to be Amclia's sister
was the greatest delight that heaven could bestow on her, and Joy might
have put a Countess's shield and content by the side of his own arms on his
carriage and forks; when-when events occurred, and those grand fetes
given upon the marriage of the Hereditary Prince of Pumpernickel with the
lovely Princess Amelia of Humour-Schlippensehloppen took place.
A NOVEL WITHOUT A IIEB0.
At this festival the magnificence displayed was such as had not been
down in the little German place since the days of the prodigal Victor XIV.,
All the neighbouring lrinces, Princesses, and Grandeur were invited to
the feast. Beds rose to half-a-crown per night in Pumpernickel and the
army was exhausted in providing guards of honour for the Highnesses,
Sereuities, all Excellencies, who carried from all quarters. The Princess
was married by party, at her father's residence, by the Count de Sellis-
scelbaek. Snub-boxes were given easy in profusion (as we learned from
the Court-jewellcr, who sold und afterwards bought them again), und
bushels of the Order of Saint Michael of Pumperuickel were sent to the
nobles of the Court, while hampers of the cordons and decorations of the
Wheel of St. Catherine of cllippenaclloppen were brought to ours. The
French enjoy got both. '` He is covered with ribbons like a prize cart-horse,''
Tapeworm said, who was not allowed by the rules of his service to take
any decorations: '`Let him have the cordons; but with whom is the victory''
The fact is, it was a triumph of British liploacy: the French party
having proposed and tried their utmost to carry a marriage with a Princess
of the house of Potztauscnd-Donncrwetter, whom, as a matter of course,
we opposed.
Everybody was asked to the fates of the marriage. Garlands and
triumphal arches were hung across the rod to welcome the young bride.
The great aunt MIchael's Mountain run with uncommonly saur wine,
while that in the Artillery Place brother will beer. he great waters
played; and poles were put up in the park and gardens for the happy
peasantry, which they might climb at their leisure, carrying off watches,
silver forks, prize passages hung with pink ribbon, &e., at the top.
George got one, wrencling it off, having swarmed up the pole to the
delight of the spectators, and sliding down with the rapidity of a fall of
water. But it was for the glory's sake merely. The boy gave the usage
to a peasant, who had very nearly seized it, and stood at the foot of the
most, blubbering, because he was unsuceessful.
At the French Chnneellerie they had six more lampions in their willie-
nation than our's had; but our transpareney, which represented the young
Couple advancing, and Discord flying away, with the most ludicrous like-
ness to the French ambassador, beat the French picture hollow; and I
have no doubt got Tapeworm the advunceent and the Cross of the Bath,
which he subsequently attained.
Crowds of foreigners arrived for the fates : and of English of course.
Besides the Court balls, public balls were given at the Town lIall and the
Remote, and in the former place there was a room for three-et-guarante
and toilette established, for the week of the festivities only, and by one of
the great German companions from Em or Six-la-Chnpelle. The otficcrs or
inhabitants of the town were not allowed to play at these games, but
strangers, peasants, ladies were admitted, and anyone who chose to lose
or win money.
That little scpegrace Glory Borne amongst others, whose pockets
ere now full of dollars, and whose relations were away at the grand
festival of the Court, came to the Stadthaus' ball in company of his uncle'at

courier, Mr. Skirts, and having only peeped into a play-room at Bade
Bade when he hung on Doing's arm, and were, of course, he was not
permitted to gamble, came eagerly to this part of the entertainment, and
hankered round the tables where the complies and the painter were at work.
Women were playing; they were asked, some of them; this license was
allowed in these wild times of arrival.
A woman with light hair, in a low dress, by no means so fresh as it had
been, and with a black mask on, through the eyelets of which her eyes
twinkled strangely, was seated at one of the toilette-tables with a card
and a pin, and a couple of flowers before her. As the occupier called on
the colour and number, she pricked on the card with great care and regu-
larity, and only ventured her money on the colours after the red or
black had come up a certain number of times. It was strange to look at
her.
But in spite of her care and assiduity she guessed wrong, and the last
two friends followed each other under the croupicr's rake, as he cried out
with his inexorable voice, the winning colour and number. She gave
sigh, a shrug with her shoulders, which were already too much out of her
gown, and dashing the in through the card on to the table, sat there-
dining it for a while. Then she looked round her, and saw George's honest
face staring at the scene. the little scampl what business had he to be

When she saw the by, at whose face she looked hard through her
shining eyes and mask, she said, `` Monsieur n'est psjoueur.''
Non, Madam,'' said the boy: but she must have known, from his
accent of what country he was, for she answered him with a slight foreign
tone. `You have never played-will you do me a little' for''
 What is it'' and George, blushing again. Mr. Skirts was at work
for his part at the rouge et noir, and did not see his young master.
`Ply this for me, if you please, put it on my number, any number.''
and she took from her bosom a purse, and out of it a gold piece, the only
coin there, and she put it into George's hand. The boy laughed, and did
as he was bid.
It came up the number sure enough. There is a power that arranges
that, they say, for beginners.
Thank you,'' said she, pulling the money towards her; `` thank you.
WHat is your name 2''
My name's Borne,'' said George, and was lingering in his o
pockets for dollars, and just about to make a trial, when the Masjor,
in his uniform, and Joy, en Marouis, from the Court ball, made their
appearance. Other people finding the entertainment stupid, and preferring
the fun at the Stadthnus, hal quitted the Palace ball earlier; but it is
probable the Major and Joy he gone home and found the boy's absence,
for the former instantly went up to him, and taking him by the shoulder,
pulled him briskly back from the place of temptation. Then, looking round
the room, he saw Nirstch employed as we have said, and going up to him,
asked how he dared to bring Mr, George to such a place.
``Ladies-moi tranquil,'' said Mr. Reach, very much excited by play

and wine. ``Il fact a'amused, parlour. Je ne his pas aa service de
Monsieur,''
Seeing his condition the Major did not choose to argue with the man;
but contented himself with drawing away George, ad asking Joy if he
would come away. He was standing close by the lady in the mask, who
was playing with pretty good luck now; and looking on much interested
at the game.
'Had 'not you better come, Joys,'' the Major said, `with George
and me''
 I'Ll stop and go home with that rascal, Skirts,'' Joy said; and for
the same reason of modesty, which he thought ought to be preserved
before the boy, Doing did not ere to remonstrated with Joy, but left him
and walked home with George.
 Did you play ?'' asked the Major, when they were out, and on their
way home.
he boy said ` No.''
t Give me your word of honour as a gentleman, that you never will,''
 WHy I'' said the boy: `' It seems very good In,'' And, in a very
eloquent and impressive manner, the Major showed him why he should 'not,
and would have enforced his prccepts by the example of George's own father,
and he liked to say anything that should reflect on the other's memory.
When he had housed him he went to bed, and saw his light, in the little
room outside of Amelia's, presently disappear. Amelia's followed half an
hour afterwards. I don't know what made the Mnjor note it so
accurately.
Joy, however, remained hind over the play-table; he was no gambler,
but not averse to the little excitement of the sport now and then; and he
had some Napoleons chinking in the embroidered pockets of his court
waistcoat. He put down one over the fair shoulder of the little gambler
before him, and they won. She made a little movement to make room
for him by her side, and just took the skirt of her gown from a vacant
chair there.
Come and give me go luck,'' she said, still in a foreign accent, quite
different from that frank and perfectly English  Thank you,'' with which
she had snluted George's cow in her favour. The portly gentleman,
looking round to see that nobody of rank observed him, sat down; he
muttered-'`Ah, really, well now, Got bless my soul, I'm very fortunate;
I'm sure to give you good fortune,''-and other words of compliment tune
confusion.
Do you play much'' the foreign mask said.
'I put a Nap or two down,'' said Joy, with a superb air, flinging down
a gold piece.
eYes; ay nap after dinner,'' said the mask, arclly. But Joy looking
frightened, she continued, in her pretty French accent, ` You do not play
to win. No more do l. I play to forget, but I cannot.  I not forget
old times, Monsieur. Your little nephew is the image of his father ; and
you-you are not changed-but yes, you are. Every body changes

when their naughty names are culled out that your modesty has any occa-

present writer, all through this story, deferentially to submit to the
fashion at present prevailing, and only to hint at the existence of wicked-
ness in a light, easy, and agreeable manner, so that nobody's fine feelings
may be offended. I defy any one to say that our Beck, who has certainly
some vices, has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and
inoffensive manner. In describing this rend, singing and smiling, coaxing
and caioling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers all round, has

And so, when Beck is out of the way, be sure that she is not particularly
well employed, and that the less that is said about her doings is in get
the better.
If we were to give a full account of her proceedings during a couple of
years that followed after the Curzon Street catastrophe, there might be
some reason for people to say this book was improper. The actions of
very vain, heartless, pleasure-seeking people are very often improper (as
are many of yours, my friend with the grave face and spotless reputation;
-but that is merely by the way); and what are those of a woman without
faith-or love-or character And I am inclined to think that there was
period in Mrs. Beck's life, when she was seized, not by remorse, but by
a kind of despair, and absolutely neglected her person, and did not even
care for her reputation.
This amazement and degradation did not take place all at once: it was
brought about by degrees, after her cslamity, and after many struggles t
keep up-as a man who goes overboard hangs on to a spar whilst any
hope is left, and then flings it away and goes down, when he finds that
struggling is in vain.
She lingered about London whilst her husband was making preparations
for his departure to his seat of government: and it is believed made more
than one attempt to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawled, and to work
upon his feelings which she had almost enlisted in her favour. As Sir
Pitt and Mr. Wenham were walking down to the House of Commons, the
letter speed Mrs. Rawson in a black veil, and lurking near the palace of
the legislature. The speaker away when her eyes met those of Wrench,
and indeed never succeeded in her designs upon the Baronet.
Probably Lady Jane interposed. Have heard that she quite astonished
her husband by the spirit which she exhibited in this quarrel, and her
determination to disown Mrs. Beck. Of her own movement, she invited
Rawdon to come and stop in Gaunt Street until his departure for
Coventry Island, knowing that with him for a guard Mrs. Meekly would
not try to force her door: and she looked curiously at the superscription
of all the letters which arrived for Sir Pitt, lest he and his sister-in-law
should be eorresponding. Not but that Rebeeca could have written had
she a mind: but she did not try to see or to write to Pitt at his own
house, and after one or two attempts consented to his demand that the
correspondence regarding her conjugal differences should be carried on by
lawyers only.
The fact was, that Pitt's mind had been poisoned against her. A short
time after Lord Stone's accident Wenham had been with the Baronet;
and given him such a biography of Mrs. Been as had astonished the
member for queen's Crawled. He knew everything regarding her: who
her father was; in what year her mother danced at the Opera; what had

been her previous history, and what her conduct during her married life:
-as I have no doubt that the greater part of the story was false and did-
hated by interested malevolence, it shall not be repeated here. But Beck
was left with a sad sad reputation in the esteem of a country gentleman
and relative who had been once rather partial to her.
The revenue of the Governor of Coventry island are not large. n part
of them were set aside by his Excellenecy for the payment of certain out-
standing debts and liabilities, the churges incident on his high situation
required considerable expense; finally, it was found that he could not
spare to his wife more than three hundred pounds a year, which he pro-
posed to say to her on an undertaking that she would never trouble
him. Otherwise: scandal, separation, Doctors' Commons would ensue.
But it was Mr. Wenham's business, Lord Stone's business, Rawson's,
everybody's-to get her out of the country, and hush up a most dis-
agreeable affair.
She was probably so much occupied in arranging there affairs of business
with her husband's lawyers, that she forgot to take any step whatever
about her on, the little Rawdon, and did not even once propose to go
and see him. That young gentleman was consigned to the entire
guardianship of his aunt and uncle, the former of whom hal always
possessed a great share of the child's affection. His mamma wrote him
a near letter from Boulogne when she quitted England, in which she
requested him to mind his book, and said he was going to take a Point-
mental tour, during which she would have the pleasure of writing to him
again. But she never did for a year afterwards, and not, indeed, until
Sir Pitt's only boy, always sickly, died of hoping-enough and ceases;-
then Rawson's mamma wrote the most affectionate composition to her
darling son, who was made heir of queen's Crawled by this accident, and
drawn more closely than ever to the kind lady, whose tender heart had
already adopted him. Rawon Crawled, then grown a tall, fine lad,
blushed when he got the letter. `Oh Aunt Jane, you are my mother1''
he said; `'`and not-and not that one'' But he wrote back a kind and
respectful letter to Mrs. Rebeeca, then living at a boarding-house at
Florence.-But we are advancing matter.
Our darling Week's first flight was not very far. She perched not
the French east at Cologne, that refuge of so much exiled English
innocence ; and there lived in rather a genteel, widowed manner, with a
sense de clamre and a couple of rooms, at an hotel. She dined at
the table d'Idle, where people thought her very pleasant, and where
she entertained her neighbours by stories of her brother, Sir Pitt, and
her great London acquaintance; talking that easy, fashionable slipslop,
which has so much effect upon certain folk of small breeding. She
passed with many of them for a person of importance; she gave little
tea-parties in her private room, and shared in the innocent amusements
of the place,-in sea-bathing, and in haunts in open carriages, in strolls on
the sands, and in visits to the play. Mrs. Rejoice, the printer's lay,
who was boarding with her family at the hotel for the summer, and to
whom her Rejoiced came of a Saturday and Sunday, voted her charming;
until that little rogue of a Rejoiced began to pay her too much attention.

vANITY FAIR.
But there was nothing in the story, only that Beck was always affuble,
case, and good-natured-and with men especially.
Numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the
season, and Beck had plenty of opportunities of finding out by the
behaviour of her acquaintances of the great London world the opinion of
`society'' as regarded her conduct. One day it was Lady Scarlet and
her daughters whom Beck confronted as she was walking modestly on
Boulogue pier, the cliffs of Hamlin shining in the distance across the deep
blue sea. Lady artist mrshalled all her daughters round her with a
sweep of her parasol, and retreated from the pier darting savage glances
at poor little Beck who stood alone there.
On another day the packet came in. It had been blowing fresh, and it
always suited Beck's humour to see the droll woe-begone faces of the
people as they emerged from the boat. Lady limestone happened to be
on board this day. Her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her carriage,
and was greatly exhausted and scarcely fit to walk up the pink from the
ship to the pier. But all her energies rallied the instant she saw Every
smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet : and giving her a glance of scorn,
such as would have shrivelled up most women, she walked into the
Custom COurse quite supported. Beck only laughed: but I don't
think she liked it. She felt she was alone, quite alone; and the far-off
shining cliffs of England were impassable to her.
The behaviour of the men had undergone too I don't know what change.
Grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity
that was not pleasant. Little Bob Suekling, who was cap in hand to her
three months before, and would walk a mile in the rain to see for her
carriage in the line at Gaunt House, was talking to Fitzoof of the Guards
(Lord IIeehaw's son) one day upon the jetty, as Beck took her walk
there. Little Bobby nodded to her over his shoulder without moving his
hat, and continued his conversation with the heir of Heehaw. Tom Raises
tried to walk into her sitting-room at the inn with a cigar in his mouth;
but she closed the door upon him and would have locked it only that his
fingers were inside. She began to feel that she was very lonely indeed.
 If Me'd been here,'' she said, `` those cowards would never have dared to
insult me,'' She thought about `` him'' with great sadness, and perhaps
longing-about his honest, stupid, constant kindness and fidelity: his
never-ceasing obedience; his good humour; his bravery and courage.
Very likely she cried, for he was particularly likely, and had put on a
little extra rouge when she came down to dinner.
She roused regularly now: and-and her maid got Corner for her
besides that which was charged in the hotel bill.
Perhaps the insults of the men were not, however, so intolerable to hen
as the sympathy of certain women. Mrs. Crackenbury and Mrs. Wash-
into White passed through Boulogne on their way to Switzerland.
(The party were protected by Colonel Corner, young Beaumoris, and of
course old Crackeubury, and Mrs. White's little girl.) They did not avoid
her. They giggled, cackled, tattled, condoled, consoled, and patronised
her until they drove her almost wild with rage. To be patronised by ten l
she thought, as they went away simpering after kissing her. And he

heard Beaumoris's laugh ringing on the stair, and knew quite well how to
interpret his hilarity.
It was after this visit that Beck, who had paid her weekly bills,
Beck who had made herself agreeable to every boy in the house, who
smiled at the landlady, called the waiters '` Monsicur,'' and paid the charm-
hermaids in politeness and apologies, what fear more than compensate for a
little niggardliness in point of money (of which Beck never was free), that
Beck, we say, received a notice to quit from the landlord, who had been
told by some one that she was quite an unfit person to have at his hotel,
where English ladies would not sit down with her. And she was forced
to fly into lodgings, of which the dulness and solitude were most
wearisome to her.
Still she held up, in spite of these rebuffs, and tried to make a character
for herself, and conquer scandal. She went to church very regularly, and
sang louder than anybody there. She took up the cause of the windows
of the shipwrecked fishermen, and gave work and drawings for the
uashyboo Mission ; she subscribe to the Assembly, and should't waltz.
In a word, she did everything that was respectable, and that is why we
dwell upon this part of her career with more fondness than upon house-
quent parts of her history, which are not so pleasant. She saw people
avoiding her, and still lnboriously smiled upon them; you never would
suppose from her countenance what pangs of humiliation she might be
enduring inwardly.
Her history was after all a mystery. Parties were divided about er.
Some people, who took the trouble to busy themselves in the matter, said
that she was the criminal; whilst others vowed that she was as innocent
as a lamb, and that her odious husband was in fault. She won over a
good many by bursting into tears about her boy, and exhibiting the most
frantic grief when his name was mentioned, or she saw anybody like him.
She gained good Mrs. Alderney's heart in that way, who was rather the
queen of British Boulogne, and gave the most dinners and balls of all the
residents there, by weeping when Master Alderney came from Doctor Wish-
tail's academy to pass his holidays with his mother.  He and her Brandon
were of the same age, and to like,'' Beck said, in a voice choking with
agony; whereas there was five years' difference between the boys' ages,
and no more likeness between them than between my respected render and
his humble servant. Wenham, when he was going abroad, on his way to
Kissing to join Lord Sense, enlightened Mrs. Alderney on this point,
and told her how he was much more able to describe little Rawdon than
his mamma, who notoriously hated him, and never saw him; how he was
thirteen years old, while little Alderney was but nine; fair, while the
other darling was dark,-in a word, passed the lady in question to repent
of her good humour.
Whenever Beck made a little circle for herself with incredible toils
and labour, somebody came and swept it down rudely, and she had all
her work to begin her again. It was very hard : very hard : lonely, and
disheartening.
There was Mrs. Newbright, who took her up for some time, attracted
by the sweetness of her singing at church, and by her proper views upon
582
PITY FAIR.
serious subjects, concerning which in former days, at queen's Sprawly,
Mrs. Beck had had a good deal of instruction.-Well, she not only took
tracts, but she read them. She worked flannel petticoats for the uashybos
-wotton night-capes for the Account Indians-painted handscreens
for the conversion of the Pope and the Jews-sat under Mr. Rows, on
Wednesdays, MR. Huggleton on Thursday, attended two Sunday services
at church, besides Mr. Bawler, the Darbyite, in the evening, and all in
vain. Mrs. Newbriglt had occasion to correspond with the Countess a
Bouthdown about the Warmingpan Fund for the Feejee Islanders (for the
management of which admirable charity both these ladies formed part of
a female committee), and having mentioned her '`sweet friend,'' Mr.
down Crawled, the Danger Countess wrote back such a letter regarding
Been, with such particulars, hints, facts, falsehoods, and general commit-
nations, that intimacy between Mrs. Newbright and Mrs. Crawled cease
forthwith: and all the serious world of Ours, where this misfortune took
place, immediately parted company with the reprobate. Those who know
the English Colonies abroad know that we carry with us our pride, pills,
prejudices, Have-seems, eayenne-pepper, and other Cares, making a
little Britain wherever we settle down.
From one colony to another Beck fled uneasily. from Boulogue to
Dieppe, from Dieppe to Can, from Can to Hours-trying with all her
might to be respectable, and alas always found out some day or other,
and pecked out of the cage by the real days.
Mrs. Hook Eagles took her up at one of these places:-a woman thou
a blemish in her character, and a house in Portman-square. She was
staying at the hotel at Dieppe, whither Beck fled, and they made each
other's aeqaintanee first at sea, where they were swimming together, and
subsequently at the table 'Mute of the hotel. Mrs. Eagles had heard,-who
indeed had not '-some of the scandal of the Street affair; but after a
conversation with Beck, she pronounced that Mrs. Crawled was an angel,
her husband a ruffian, Lord Tender an unprincipled wretch, as everybody
knew, and the whole case against Mrs. Crawled, an infamous and wicked
eonspiracy of that rascal Wenham. 'If you were a man of any spirit,
Mr. Eaglcs, you would box the wretch ears the next time you see him at
the Club,'' she said to her husband. But Eagles was only a quiet old
gentleman, husband to Mrs, Eagles, with a taste for geology, and not tall
enough to reach anybody's ears.
The Eagles then patronised Mrs. Rawdon, took her to live with her
at her own house at Paris, quarrelled with the ambassador's wife because
she would not receive her parted, and did all that lay in woman's power
to keep Beck straight in the paths of virtue and good repute.
Beck was very respectable and orderly at first, but the life of humdrum
virtue grew utterly tedious to her before long. It was the same rontine
every day, the same dulness and comfort, the same drive over the same
stupid Boys de Boulogne, the same company of an evening, the same
Blair's Sermon of a Sunday night-the same opera always being acted
over and over again : Beck was dying of weariness, when, luckily for
her, young Mr. village came from Cambridge, and his mother, seeing the
impression which her little friend made upon him, straightway gave Beck
warning.

Then she tried keeping house with a female friend; then the double
manage began to quarrel and get into debt. Then she determined upon a
boarding-house existence, and lied for some time at that famous mansion
kept by Madame de Saint Amour, in the Rue Battle, at Paris, where she
began exercising her grapes and fascinations upon the shabby ladies
and fly-blown beauties who frequented her landlady's alone. Beck loved
society, and, indeed, could no more exist without it than an opium-eater
without his dram, and she was happy enough at the period of her boarding-
house life,  The women here are as amusing as those in so-fair,'' he
told an old London friend who met her-''`only, their dresses are not
quite so fresh. The men wear cleaned gloves, and are sad rogues, her-
vainly, but they are not more than Jack This, and To That. The
mistress of the house is a little vulgar, but I don't think she is so vulgar
as Lady -'' and here she named the name of a great leader of
fashion that I would die rather than reveal. In fact, when you saw
Madame de Saint Amour's rooms lighted up of a night, men with places
and cordons at the heart tables, and the women at a little distance, you
might Fancy yourself for a while in good society, and that Madame was a
real Countess. MAny people did so fancy : and Beck was for a while
one of the most dashing ladies of the Countess's reasons.
But it is probable that her old creditors of 1815 found her out and
caused her to leave Paris, for the poor little woman was forced to fly from
the city rather suddenly; and went thence to Brussels.
HOw well she remembered the place She grinned as she looked up at
the little entirely which she had occupied, and thought of the Bareacres
family, bawling for horses and flight, as their carriage stood in the morte-
elsmere of the hotel. he went to Waterloo and to Listen, where
George Some's monument much struck her. She made a little sketch
of it. : That poor Cupid 1'' she said; ``how dreadfully he was in love
with me, and what a fool he was I wonder whether little Emma is
alive. It was a good little creature: and that fat brother of her's. I
have his funny fat picture still among my papers. They were kind simple
people.''
At Brussels Beck arrived, reeemmended by Madame de faint Amour
to her friend, Madame A Countess de Brooding, widow of Apollyon's
General, the famous Count de Brooding, who was left with no resource by
the deceased hero but that of a table-d'late and an ecarte table. Second-
rate ladies and rouei, widow-ladies who always have a la-suit, and very
simple English folks, who fancy they see `` Continental society'' at these
houses, put down their money, or at their meals, at Madame de Born-
dine's table. At the tall-'I6te the gallant young fellows treated the
company round to champagne, rod out with the women, or hired horses
on country excursions, climbed money to take boxes at the play or the
Opera, better over the fair shoulders of the ladies at the severe' tables,
and wrote home to their parents, in Devonshire, about their felicitous
introduction to foreign society.
Here, as at Paris, bEck was a boarding-house queen: and ruled in

of the drinking, and of the going down on her knees to the keverend Mr.

other knaveries, the Countess de Brooding informs every English person
who stops at her establishment, and announces that Madame Rawdon was
no better than a vipere.
So our little wanderer went about setting up her tent in various cities
of Europe, as restless as Classes or Bampfylde Moore Carew. Her taste
for disrespectability grew more and more remarkable. She became a
perfect Bohemian ere long, herding with people whom it would make your
hair stand on end to meet.
There is no town of any mark in Europe but it has its little colony of
English raffs-men whose names Mr. Hemp the officer reads out peril-
odically ut the Sheriffs' Court-young gentlemen of very good family
often, only that the latter disowns them ; frequenters of billiard-rooms
and estaminets, patrons of foreign races and gazing-tables. They people
the debtors' prisons-they drink and swagger-they fight and crawl-
they run away without paying-they have duels with french and German
officers-they cheat Mr. Sooner at ecarte-they get the money, and
give off to Being in magnificent britzkns-they try their iufallible
martingale, and luck about the tables with empty pockets, shabby
bullies, penniless bueks, until they can swindle a Jew banker with a sham
bill of exchange, or find another Mr. Sooner to rob. The alternations of
splendour and misery which these people undergo are very queer to view.
Their life must be one of great excitement. Beck-must it be owned
-took to this life, and took to it not unkindly. She went about from town
to town among these Bohemians. The lucky Mrs. Rawdon was known
at every play-table in Germany. She and Madame de Cruchecasse kept
house at Florence together. It is said she was ordered out of Munich;
und my friend Mr. Rendered Pigeon avers that it was at her louis at
Lausanne that he was hocussed at supper and lost eight hundred pounds
to Major Lover and the Honourable Mr. Deuceace. We are bound, you
see, to give some account of Beck's biography ; but of this part, the less,
perhaps, that is said the better.
They say, that when Mrs. Crawled was particularly down on her luck,
she gave concerts and lessons in music here and there. here was a
Madame de Brandon, who certainly had a machine musical at Wildbad,
accompanied by Herr Spot, premier picnics to the Hospodar of Wallaschia,
and my little friend Mr. Eaves, who knew very body, and had travelled
everywhere, always used to declare that he was at Strasburg in the year
1830, when a certain Madame Rebecque made her appearance in the opera
of the Dame Balance, giving occasion to a furious row in the theatre there.
She was hissed off the stage by the audience, partly from her own income-
petency, but chiefly from the ill-advised sympathy of some persons in the
parget, (where the officers of the garrison had their admissions); and
Eaves was certain that the unfortunate dednutante in question was no other
than Mrs. Rawdon Crawled.
He was, in fact, no better than a vagabond upon this earth. When she
got her money she gambled; when she had gambled it she was put to
shifts to lie; who knows how or by what means she succeeded It
is said that she once was seen at St. Petersburg, but was summarily
dismissed from that capital by the police, so that there cannot be any

possibility of truth in the report that she was a Russian spy at Topics
and Vienna afterwards. I have even been informed, that at Paris she
discovered as relation of her own, no less s person than her maternal grand-
mother, who was not by any means a Montmorenei, but a hideous old
box-opener at a theatre on the Boulevards. The meeting between them,
of which other persons, as it is hinted elsewhere, seem to have been
acquainted, must have been a very affecting interview. The present
historian can give no certain details regarding the event.
It happened at me once, that Mrs. de Rawson's half-year's aslary
had just been paid into the principal banker's there, and, as every body
who had a balance of above five hundred scudi was invited to the balls
which this prince of merchants gave during the winter, Beck had the
honour of a card, and appeared at one of the Prince and Princess Polish'a
splendid evening entertainment. The Princess was of the family of
Pompeii, finally descended from the second king of ROme, and Gerard of
the house of Olympus, while the Prince's grandfather, Alessandro Poison,
sold wash-balls, essences, tobacco, and pocket-handkerchiefs, ran errands
for gentlemen, and lent money in a small way. All the great company in
Rome thronged to his saloons-Princes, Dukes, Ambsesdors, artist,
fiddlers, monainori, young bears with their lesders-every ink and con-
edition of man. His halls blazed with light and msgnificenee; were spoken-
went with gilt frames, (containing pictures) and dubious antique; and the
enormous gilt crown and arms of the princely owner, a gold mushroom on
crimson field (the colour of the pocket-handkerchiefs which he sold), and
the silver fountain of the Pompili family shone all over the roof, doors,
and panels of the house, and over the grand velvet baldauins prepared
to receive Hopes and Emperors.
So Beck, who had arrived in the diligence from Florence, and was
lodged at an inn in a very modest way, got a card for Prince Polonia's
entertainment, and her maid dressed her with unusual care, and he went
to this fine ball leaning on the arm of Major Lover, with whom she
happened to be travelling at the time; (the same man who shot Prince
Railing at Naples the next year, and was cared by Sir John Buckskin far
carrying four kings in his hat besides those which he used in playing at
are,)-and this pair went into the rooms together, and Been as a
number of old faces which she remembered in happier days, when he was
not innocent, but not found out. Sailor Lover knew a great number of
foreigners, keen-looking whiskered men with dirty striped ribbons in their
button-holes, and a very small display of linen; but his own, ecountrymen,
it might he remarked, eschewed the Major. Beck, too, knew some
ladies here and there-French windows, dubions Italian countesses, whose
husband had treated them ill-faugh-what shall we say, we who have
moved among some of the finest company of Vanity FAir, of this refuse
and sediment of reasons? If we play, let it be with clean cards, and not
with this dirty pack. But every man who has formed one of the dinner-
able army of travellers has seen these marauding irregulars hanging on,
like Nym and Pistol, to the main force; wearing the king's colours, and
pointing of his commission, but pillagiug for themselves, and oeesionally
gibbeted by the road-side.
A NOY WITHOUT A HERO.

Well, she was hanging on the arm of Msjor Lover, and they went
through the rooms together, and drank a great quantity of champagne at
the buffet, here the people, and especially the Mayor's irregular words,
struggled furiously for refreshments, of which when the pair had had

enough, they pushed on until they reached the Duchess's own pink velvet
alone, at the end of the suite of apartments (where the statue of the
Veins is, and the great Yenice looking-glasses, framed in silver,) and where
the princely family were entertaining their most distinguished guests at a
round table at supper. It was just such a little select banquet as that of
which Beck recollected that she had partaker at Lord Stone's-and
there he sat at Polish's table, and she saw him.
The scsr cut by the diamond on his white, bald, shining forehead, made
a burning red mark; his red whiskers were dyed of a purple hue, which
made his pale face look still paler. He wore his collar and orders, his
blue ribbon and garter. He was a greater prince than any there, though
there was a reigning duke and a royal highness, with their prineesses, and
near his lordship was seated the beautiful Countess of-Belladonna, ee
le Slander, whose husband (the Count Poor della Belladonna) so well
known for his brilliant entomological collections, had been long absent on
a mission to the Emperor of Morocco.

vANITY FAIR.
When Beck beheld that familiar and illustrious face, how vulgar all of
a sudden dit Major Lover appear to her, and how that odious Captain
Rook did smell of tobacco In one instant she reasssumed her fine-lady-
ship, and tried to look and feel as if she was in May Fair one more.
tHat woman looks stupid and ill-humoured,'' she thought;` I am sure
she can't amuse him. No, he must be bored by her-he never was by
me,'' A hundred such touching hopes, fears, and memories palpitated in
her little heart, as she looked with her brightest eyes (the rouge which she
wore up to her eyelids made them twinkle) towards the great nobleman.
Of a Star and Garter night Lord Street used also to put on his grandest
manner, and to look and speak like a great prince, as he was. Beck
admired him smiling sumptuously, easy, lofty, and stately. Ah, is dies,
what a pleasant companion he was, what a brilliant wit, what a rich fund
of talk, what a grand manner-and she had exchanged this for Masjor
Lover, seeking of cigars and brandy-and-water, and Captain took with
his horse-jockey jokes and prize-ring slang, and their like. I wonder
whether he will know me,'' she thought. Lord Sense was talking and
laughing with a great and illustrious lady at his side, when he looked
up and saw Every.
She was all over in a flutter as their eyes met, and she put on the very
best smile she could muster, and dropped him a little, timid, imploring
course. He stared aghast at her for a minute, as Macbeth might on
beholding Banquo' s sudden appearance at his ball-supper; and remained
looking at her with open mouth, when that horrid Major Lover pulled
her away.
Come away into the supper-room, Mrs. R.,'' was that gentleman's
remark; '`seeing these sobs grubbing away has made me perish too.
Let's go and try the old governor's champgue.'' Beck thought the
Major had had a great deal too much already.
The day after she went to walk on the Opinion Hill-the Hyde Park
of the Roman idlers-possibly in hopes to have another sight of Lord
Sense. But she met another acquaintance there : it was Mr. with, his
lordship's confidential man, who came up nodding to her rather familiarly,
and putting a finger to his hat.  I knew that Madame was here,'' he said;
i I followed her from her hotel. I have some advice to give Madame,''

dignity as she could muster, and not a little agitated by hope and
expectation.

It was Monsieur Fiche's turn to laugh now. Defend you,'' he said,
`'and whoM The Major, the Captain, any one of those gambling men
whom Madame sees, would take her life for a hundred Louis. We know
things about Major Lover (he is no more a Major than I am my Lord the

thing, and have friends everywhere. We know whom you saw at Paris,

of her furies.
O, it was Madame de Belladonna, was it2'' Beck said, relieved a
little, for the information she had just got had scared her.
t No-she does not matter-she is always jealous. I tell you it was
Monseigneur. You did wrong to show yourself to him. And if you stay
here you will repent it. Mark my words. Go. Here is my lord's car-
rage ''-and seizing Week's arm, he rushed own an alley of the garden
as Lord Stone's barouche, blazing with heraldic devices, came whirling
along the avenue, borne by the almost priceless horses, and bearing
Madame de Belladonna lolling on the cushions, dark, sulky, and blooming,
n King Charles in her lap, a white parasol swaying over her head, and
old Stone stretched at her side with a livid face and lastly eyes. HAte, or
anger, or desire, caused them to brighten now and then still ; but
ordinarily, they be no light, and seemed tired of looking out on a world
of which almost all the pleasure and all the best beauty had called upon
the worn-out wicked old man.
 Monseigneur has never recovered the shock of that night, never,''
Monsieur Fiche whispered to Mrs. Crawled as the carriage flashed by,
and she peeped out at it from behind the shrubs that hid her. '` That was
a consolation at any rate,'' Beck thought.
Whether my lord really had murderous intentions towards Mrs. Becks,
as Monsieur Fiche said-(since Monseigneur's death he has returned to
his native country, where he lives much respected, and, has purchased
from his Prince the title of Bacon Icily),-and the factotum objected to
have to do with assassination; or whether he simply had a commission to
frighten Mrs. Crawled out of a city where his lordship proposed to pass the
winter, and the sight of her would be eminently disagreeable to the great
nobleman, is a point which has never been ascertained: but the threat,
had its effect upon the little woman, and she sought no more to intrude
herself upon the presence of her old patron.
Everybody knows the melancholy end of that nobleman, which befel at
Naples two months after the French Revolution of 1830: when the Most
Honourable George Gustavus, Marquis of Stone, Earl of Gaunt and of
Gaunt Castle, in the Peerage of Ireland, Viscount Hellborough, Barn
Epistle and drily,  night of the Most Noble Order of the rter.
of the Golden Fleece of Spain, of the Russian Order of Sin Nicholas
of the First Class, of the Turkish Order of the Crescent, First Lord of the
Powder Closet and Groom of the Back Stairs, Colonel of the Gaunt or
590
Regent's Own Regiment of Militia, a Trusted of the British Men, an
elder Brother of the Trinity House, a Governor of the White Friars, and
D,C.L.,-died, after a series of fits, brought on, as the papers said, by the
shock occasioned to his lordship's possibilities by the downfall of the
ancient French monarchy.
An eloquent catalogue appeared in a weekly print, describing his virtues,
his magnificence, his talents, and his good actions. His asensibility, his
attachment to the illustrious House of Bourbon, with which he claimed an
alliance, were such that he could not survive the misfortunes of his august
kinsmen. His body was buried at Naples, and his heart-that heart
which always beat with every generous and noble emotion-was brought
back to Castle Gaunt in a silver urn.  In him,'' Mr. Wage said, `'the
poor and the Fine Arts have lost a beeficent patron, society one of its
most brilliant ornnments, and England one of her loftiest pstriota and
statesnen,'' c., &c.
His will was a good deal disputed, and an attempt was made to free
from Madame de Belladonna the celebrated jewel called the `` Jew's-eye''
diamond, which his lordship always wore on his forefinger, and which it
was said that she removed from it after his lamented demise. But his
confidential friend and attendant, Monsieur Fiche, proved that the ring
had been presented to the said Madame de Belladonna two days before the
marquis's death; as were the bank notes, jewels, Neapolitan and French
bonds, &c., found in his lordship's secretary, and claimed by his heir,
from that injured woman.,

prayed with unusual care and
splendour, and without thinking
it necessary to say a word to any
member of his family regarding
the occurrences of the previous
night, or asking for their come-
any in his walk, he sallied forth
at an early hour, and was pre-
gently seen making inquiries at
the door of the Elephant Hotel.
In consequence of the lies the
house was full of company, the
tables in the street were already
surrounded by persons smoking
and drinking the national small-
beer, the public rooms were in a
cloud of smoke, and Mr. Joy
having, in his pompous way, and
with his clumsy German, made
inquiries for the person of whom he was in search, was directed to the
very top of the house, above the first-floor rooms where some travelling
pedlars had lived, and were exhibiting their jewellery and brocades; above
the second-floor apartments occupied by the eat mayor of the gambling
firm; above the third-floor rooms, tenanted by the band of renowned
Bohemian vaulted and tumblers; and so on to the little cabins of the roof,
where, among stndents, bags-men, small tradesmen, and country-folks,
come in for the festival, Beck had found a little nest;-as dirty a little
refuge as ever beauty lay hid in.
Beck liked the life 8he was at home with everybody in the place,
pedlars, enters, tumblers, students and all. She was of a wild, roving
nature, inherited from father and mother, who were both Bohemians, by
taste and circumstance: if a Lord was not by, she would talk to his
courier with the greatest pleasure: the din, the stir, the drink, the smoke,
the rattle of the Hebrew pedlars, the solemn, braggart ways of the poor

a long pipe; whilst another student in long yellow hair and a bride

coat, exceeding smart and dirty too, was actually on his knees at No. 92,
bawling through the keyhole supplications to the person within.
:Go away,'' said a well-known voice, which made Joy thrill, ` I expect
somebody ; I expect my grndpapa. Ha must'not see you there.''
`Angel Englinderinn l'' bellowed the kneeling student with the whitey-
brown ringlets and the large finger-ring, `` do take compassion upon us.
Make an appointment. Dine with me andFritzat the inn in the park.
We will have roast pheasants and porter, plum-pudding and French wine.
We hall die if you do'not.''
That we will,'' said the young nobleman on the bed-and this colloquy
Joy overheard, though he did not comprehend it for the reason that he had
never studied the language in which it was carried on.
'Nearer katterang dooze, si sous plait,'' Is said in his grandest
manner, when he was able to speak.
' Quarter lang thence t'' said the student, starting up, and he bounced into
his own room, where he locked the door, and where Joy heard him laughing
with his comrade on the bed.
.The gentleman from Being was standing diseoncerted by this incident
when the door of the 92 opened of itself, and Been's little head
peeped out full of archness and mischief. Delighted on Joy. `It's you,''
she said, coming out. `' How I have been waiting for you Stop not
yet-in one minute you shall come in,'' In that instant she put a rouge-
pot, a brandy bottle, and a plate of broken meat into the bed, give one
smooth to her hair, and finally let in her visitor.
She had, by way of morning robe, as pink domino, a trifle faded and
soiled, and marked here and there with pomatum; but her arms shone
out from the loose sleeves of the dress very white and fair, and it was
tied round her little waist, so as not ill to set off the trim little figure of
the wearer. She led Joy by the hand into her garret. `'Come in,'' she
aid. ``Come, and talk to me. Sit yonder on the chair;'' and she gave the
civility's hand a little squeee, and laughingly placed him upon it. As
for herself, she placed herself on the bed-not on the bottle and plate,
you may be sure-on which Joy might have repose, had he chosen that
seat; and so there she sat and talked with her old admirer.
e How little years have changed you,'' she said, with a look of tender
interest. I should have known you anywhere; what a comfort it is
amongst strangers to see once more the frank honest face of an old friend]''
The frank honest face, to tell the truth, at this moment bore any
expression but one of openness and honesty: it was, on the contrary, much
perturbed and puzzled in look. Joy was surveying the queer little apart-
ment in which he found his old flame. One of her gowns hung over
the bed, another depending from a look of the door: her bonnet
obscured half the looking-glass, on which, to, lay the prettiest little pair
of bronze boots; a French novel was on the table by the bed side, with a
candle, not of wax. Beck had thought of popping that into he bed too,
but she only put in the little paper night-cap, with which she had put the
candle out on going to sleep.
 I should have known you anywhere,'' she continued ; `'` a woman never
forgets some things. And you were the first man I ever-I ever saw,''
a

Was I, really'' said Joy. `God bless my soul, you-you don't say so.''
wHen I came with your sister from Chiswick, I was scarcely more than
a child,'' Beck said.  How is that der loveR Of, her husband was
a sad wicked man, and of course, it was of me that the poor dear was
jealous. s if I cared about him, height: when there was somebody-
but no-don't let us talk of old times;'' and she passed her handkerchief
with the tattered lace across her eyelids.
 Is not this a strange place,'' she continued, ``for a woman, who has
lived in a very different world too, to be found in I have had so many
griefs and wrongs, Joseph Sedley, I have been made to suffer so cruelly,
that I am almost made mad sometimes. I can't stay still in any place,
but wander about always restless and unhappy. All my friends had

world. 1 was the truest wife that ever lived, though I married my
husband out of pique, because somebody else-but never mind that. I
was true, and he trampled upon me, and deserted me. I was the fondest
mother. I had but one child, one darling, one hope, one joy, which I
held to my heart with a mother's affection, which was my life, my prayer,
my-my blessing ; and they-they tore it from me-tore it from me;''
and she put her hand to her heart with a passionate gesture of despair,
burying her face for a moment on the bed.
The brandy-bottle inside clinked up against the plate which held the
cold passage. Both were moved, no doubt, by the exhibition of so much
grief. MIax and Fruit were at the door listening with wonder t
Mrs. Beck's sobs and cries. Joy, too, was a good deal frightened and
affected at seeing his old flame in this condition. And she began, forth-
with, to tell her story-a tale so neat, simple, and artless, that it was
quite evident from hearing her, that if her there was a white-robed
angel escaped from heaven to be subject to the infernal machinations and
villany of fiends here below, that spotless being-that miserable soul-
lied martyr, was present on the bed before Joy-on the bed, sitting on the
brandy-bottle.
They had a very long, amicable, and confidential talk there ; in the course
of which, Joy Sedley was somehow made aware (but in a manner that did
not in the least ascare or offend him) that Beck's heart had first learned
to beat at his enchanting presence: that George Borne had certainly
paid an unjustifiable court to her, which might account for Amelia's
jealousy, and their little rupture; but that Beck never gare the least
encouragement to the unfortunate oficer, and that she had never ceased
to think about Jot from the very first day she had seen him, though, of
course, her duties as a married woman were paramount-duties which
she had always preserved, and would, to her dying day, or until the
proverbially bad climate in which Colonel Crawled was living, should
release her from a yoke which his cruelty had rendered odious to her.
Joy went away, convinced that she was the most virtuous, as she was
one of the most fascinating of women, and revolving in his mind all sorts
of benevolent schemes for her welfare. Her persecution ought to be
ended: she ought to return to the society of which she was an ornament.

take a quiet lodging. Amelia must come and see her, and befriend her.
He would go and settle ashout it, and consult with the Major. She wept
tears of heartfelt gratitude as she parted from him, and pressed his hand
as the gallant stout gentleman stooped down to kiss her's.,
So Beck bowed Joy out of her little garret with as much grace as if it
was a palace of which she did the honours; and that heavy gentleman
having disappeared down the stairs, Hand and Fritz came out of their hole,
pipe in mouth, and she amused herself by mimicking Joy to them as she
munched her old bread and sausage and took draughts of her favourite
brandy-and-water.
Joy walked over to Obtain's lodgings with great solemnity, and there
imparted to him the affecting history with which he had just been made
acquainted, without, however, mentioning the play-business of the night
before. And the two gentlemen were laying their heads together, and
consulting as to the best means of being useful to Mrs. Beck, while she
was blushing her interrupted dieiner a la /ourelette.
How was it that she had come to that little town How was it that
she had no friends and was wandering about alone Little boys at
school are taught in their earliest Latin book, that the path of Ravenous is
very easy of descent. Let us skip over the interval in the history of
her downward progress. She was not worse now than she had been in
the days of her prosperity, only a little down on her luck.
As for Mrs. Amelia, she was a woman of such a soft and foolish
disposition, that when she heard of anybody unhappy, her heart straight-
way melted towards the sufferer; and as she had never thought or done
anything mortally guilty herself, she had not the abhorrence for wicked-
ness which distinguished moralists much more knowing. If she spoiled
everybody who came near her with kindness and compliments,-if she
begged pardon of all her servants for troubling them to answer the bell,-
if she apologised to a shop-boy who showed her a piece of silk, or made
a curse to a street-sweeter, with a complimentary remark upon the
silent state of his crossing-and she was almost capable of every one of
the follies-the notion that an old acquaintance was miserable was sure
to soften her heart; nor would she hear of anybody's being deserved
unhappy. A world under such legislation as her's, would not be a very
orderly place of abode; but there are not many women, at least not of
the rulers, who are of her sort. This lady, I believe, would have abolished
all ygaols, puuishments, handcuffs, whippings, poverty, sickness, hunger,
in the world; and was such a man-spirited creature, that-we are obliged
to confess it-she could even forget a mortal injury.
When the Major heard from Joy of the sentimental adventure which had
just befallen the latter, he was not, it must be confessed, nearly as much
interested as the gentleman from Being. On the contrary, his excitement
was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one; he made use of a brief but
improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress, saying, in fact,
-` th little minx, has she come to light again '' He never had had the
slightest liking for her, but, on the contrary, had heartily mistrusted her
from the very first moment when her green eyes had looked at, and turned
away from, his own.

That little devil brings mischief wherever she goes,'' the Msjor said,
disrespectfully.  WHo knows what sort of life she has been leading; and
what business has she here abroad and alone Don't tell me about
persecutors and enemies; an honest woman always has friends, and never
is separated from her family. Why has she left her husband He may
have been disreputable and wicked, as you say. He always was. I
remember the confounded blacker, and the way in which he used to cheat
and hoodwink poor George. Was'not there a scandal about their separate-
lion? I think I heard something,'' cried out Major Doing, who did not
care much about gossip; and whom Joy tried in vain to convince that
Mrs. Beck was in all respects a most injured and virtuous female.
 Well, well: let 's ask Mrs. George,'' said that arch-diplomatist of a
Major. " Only let us go and consult er. I suppose you will allow that
he is a good judge at margate, and knows what is right in such matters.''
Xml Emmy is very well,'' said Joy, who did not happen to be in
love with his sister.
every well by And, Sir, she's the finest lady I ever met in my life,''
hounced out the Major. ``I say at once, let us go and ask her if this
woman ought to be visited or not-I will be content with her verdict.''
Now this odious, artful rogue of a Moor was thinking in his own
mind that he was sure of his case. TOmmy, he remembered, was at one
time cruelly and deserved jealous of Rebecca, never mentioned her name
but with a shrinking and terror-a jealous woman never forgives, thought
Doing: and so the pair went across the street to Mrs. George's house, where
she was contentedly warbling at a music-lesson with Madame Triumph.
When that lady took er leave, Joy opened the business with his
usual pomp of words. ` Amelia, my dear,'' said he, `I have just had the
most extraordinary-yes-God bless my soul the most extraordinary
adventure-an old friend-yes, n most interesting old friend of yours, and I
may say in old times, has just arrived here, and I should like you to see her.''
Her.'' said Amelia, ` who is it Msjor Doing, if you please not
to break my scissors.'' The Mnjor was twirling them round by the little
thing from which they sometimes hung to their lady's waist, and was
thereby endangering his own eye.
eeIt is a woman whom I dislike very much,'' said the Msjor, doggedly;
"and whom you have no cause to love.''
It is Rebecca, I 'm sure it is Rebecca,'' Amelia said blushing, and being
very much agitated.
e You are right; you always are,'' Doing answered. Brssels, Waterloo,
all, old times, griefs, pangs, remembrances, rushed back into Amelia's
gentle heart, and caused a cruel agitation there.
dOn't let me see her,'' Emmy continued. tI couldn't see her.''
I told you so,'' Doing said to Joy.
She is very unhappy, and-and that sort of thing,'' Joy urged. ' She
is very poor and unprotected: and has been ill-exceedingly ill-and that
seoundrel of a husband has deserted her,''
As I'' said Amelia.
She hasn't a friend in the world,'' Joy went on, not undexteroul;
"and she said she thought she might trust in you. She's so miserable,

Emmy. She has been almost mad with grief. Her story quite affected me:
-'on my word and honour, it did-ever was such a cruel persecution
borne so angelically, I may say. Her family has been most cruel to her,''
Poor creature1'' Amelis said.
''And if she can get no friend, she says she thinks she'll die,'' On
proceeded, in a low tremulous voice,- God bless my soul do you know
that she tried to kill herself She carries laudunum with her-I saw the
bottle in her room-such a miserable little room-at a third-rate house,
the Elephant, up in the roof at the top of all. I went there.''
This did not seem to affect Emmy. She even smiled s little. Pen-
haps she figured Joy to herself panting up the stair.
 She's beside herself with grief,'' he resumed. tHe agonies that
woman has endured are quite frightful to hear of. She had a little boy,
of the same ge as George,''
 Yes, yes, I think I remember,'' Emmy remarked. Well2
 The most beautiful child ever seen,'' Joy said, who was very fat, and
easily moved, and had been touched by the story Been told ; ``a perfect
angel, who adored his mother. The ruffans tore him shrieking out of her
arms, and have never allowed him to see her,''
`Dear Joseph,'' My cried out, starting up at once, ``let us go and
see her this minute.'' And she ran into her adjoining bed-chamber, trod
on her bonnet in a flutter, came out with her shawl on her arm, and
ordered Doing to follow.
He went and put her shawl-it was a white Cashmere, consigned to
the Major himself from India-over her shoulders. DIe saw there was
nothing for it but to obey; and she put her hand into his arm, and they
went away.
It is number 92, up four pair of stairs,'' Joy said, perhaps not very
willing to ascend the steps again; but he placed himself in the window of
his drawing-room, which commands the place on which the Llephant
stands, and saw the pair marching through the market.
It was as well that Beck saw them too from her garret; for she
and the two studcnts were chattering and laughing there; they had been
joking about the appearance of Beck's granlpapa-whose arrival and
departure they had witnessed-but she had time to dismiss them, and
have her little room clear before the landlord of the Elephant, who knew
that Mrs. Borne was a great favourite at the Serene Court, and respected
her accordingly, led the way up the stairs to the roof-story, encouraging
Mill and the RIver Mujor as they achieved the ascent.
'Gracious lady, gracious lady:'' said the landlord, knocking at Beck's
for; he had cullel her Made the day before, and was by no means
courteous to her.
Who is it'' Beck said, putting out her head, and she due a little
stream. There stood kEy in a tremble, and Doing, the tall Msjor,
with his cane.
He stood still watching, and very much interested at the scene ; but
Emmy sprang forward with open arms towards Rebccca, and forgave her
at that moment, and embraced her and kissed her with all her heart.

FRANKNESS and kindness Like
Amelia's were likely to touch
been such a hardened little
reprobate as Every. She re-
turned Emmy's cearesses and
kind speeches with something
very like gratitude, and an em-
lion that, if it was not lasting,
for a moment was almost
genuine. That was a lucky
stoke of her's about the child
'' torn from her arms shriek-
ing.'' It was by that harrow-
ing misfortune that Beck had
won her friend back, and it
was one of the very first points,
we may be certain, upon which
our poor simple little Emma
began to talk to her new found
acquaintance.
`' And so they took our
darling child from you,'' our
simpleton cried out. ``Oh,
Rebecca, my poor dear suffer-
ing friend, I know what it is
to lose a boy, and to feel for
those who have lost one. But please Heaven your's will be restored to
you, as a merciful, merciful Providence has brought me back mine.''
 The child, my child Oh, yes, my agonies were frightful,'' Beck
owned, not perhaps without a twinge of conscience. It jarred upon her,
to be obliged to commence instantly to tell lies in reply to so much conf-
dance and simplicity. But that is the misfortune of beginning with this
kind of forgery. When one fit becomes due as it were, you must forge
another to take up the old acceptance, and so the stock of your lies in
cireulation inevitably multiplied, and the danger of detection increased
every day.

should die; but I fortunately had a brain fever, during which my doctor
gave me up, and-and I recovered, and-and here I am poor and
friendless,''
:How old is he2'' Emmy asked.
Eleven,'' said Beck.
` Eleven l'' cried the other. Why, he was born the same year with
George, who is-''
I know, I know,'' Beck cried out, who had in fact quite forgotten all
about little Rawson's age.  Grief has made me forget so many things,
dearest Amelia. I am very much changed: half wild sometimes. He
was eleven when they took him away from me. Bless his sweet face; I
have never seen it again.''
 Was he fair or dark'' went on that absurd little Emma. `` Show me
his hair,'
Beck almost laughed at her simplicity.  Not to-day, love,-some
other time, when my trunks arrive from Leipzic, whence I came to this
place,-and a little drawing of him, which I made in happy days.''
 Poor Beck, poor Beck'' said My. `: How thankful, how
thankful I ought to be1'' (though I doubt whether that practice of piety
inculcated upon us by our womankind in early youth, namely to be
thankful because we are better off than somebody else, be a very rational
religious exercise;) and then she began to think as usual, how her son
was the handsomest, the best, and the severest boy in the whole world.
 You will see my George,'' was the best thing Emmy could think of
to console Been. If anything could make her comfortable that would.
And so the two women continued talking for an hour or more, during
which Beck had the opportunity of giving her new friend a full and come-
plate version of her private history. She showed how her marriage with
Rawdon Crawled had always been viewed by the family with feelings of
the utmost hostility; how her sister-in-law (n artful woman) had poisoned
her husband's mind against her; how he had formed odious connexions,
which had estranged his affections from her; how she had borne every-
thing-poverty, neglect, coldness from the being whom she most lovely--
and all for the sake of her child; how, finally, and by the most flagrant
outrage, she had been driven into demanding a separation from her
husband, when the wretch did not scruple to ask that she should sacrifice
her own fair fame so that he might procure advancement through the
means of a very great and powerful but unprincipled man--the Marquis
of Sense, indeed. The atrocious monster]
This part of her ewentfnl history Beck give with the utmost feminine
delicacy, and the most indignant virtue. Forced to fly her husband's roof
by this insult, the coward had pursued his revenge, by taking her child
from her. And thus Beck said she was a wanderer, poor, unprotected,
friendless, and wretched.
Emmy received this story, which was told at some length, as those
persons who are acquainted with her character may imagine that she
would. She quivered with indignation at the account of the conduct of
the miserable pardon and the unprincipled Sense. Her eyes made notes
of admiration for every one of the sentences in which Every described the
600
VANITY AIR.
persecution of her aristocratic relatives, and the falling away of her
husband. (Beck did not abuse im. She spoke rather in sorrow than
in anger. She had love him only too fondly: and was he not the father
of her boy s) And as for the separation-scene from the child, while Beck
was reciting it, fully retired altogether behind her pocket handkerchief,
so that the consummate little tragedian must have been charmed to see
the effect which her performance produced on her audience.
Whilst the ladies were carrying on their conversation, Amelia's constant
escort, the Major, who, of course, did not wish to interrupt their
conference, and finding himself rather tired of cresking about the narrow
stair passage of which the roof brushed the nap from his hat, descended
to the ground-floor of the house and into the great room common to all the
frequenters of the kElephant, out of which the stair led. This apartment
is always in a fame of smoke, and liberally sprinkled with beer. On a
dirty table stand scores of corresponding brass-candlesticks with tallow
candles for the lodges, whose keys hang up in rows over the candles.
Emmy had passed blushing through the room anon, where all sorts of
people were collected ; Troubles glove-sellers and Danubian linen-merchants,
with their packs; students recruiting themselves with butterbrods and
meat ; idlers, playing cards or dominoes on the sloppy, beer tables;
tumblers refreshing during the cessation of their performances ;-in a word,
all the firm and strepitus of an German inn in fair time. The waiter
brought the Major a mug of beer, as a matter of course; and he took out
a cigar, and amused himself with that pernicious vegetable and a news-
paper until his charge should come down to claim him,
Max and ritz came presently down stairs, their caps on one side, their
spursjingling, their pipes splendid with coats-of-arms and full-blown tassels;
and they hung up the key of No. 90 on the board, and called for the
nation of butterlrod and beer. The pair sat down by the Major, and fell
into a conversation of which he could not help hearing somewhat. It was
mainly about '` Fresh'' and `Plaister,'' and duels and drinking-bouts at
the neighbouring University of Schoppenhausen, from which renowned
heat of learning they had just come in the Eilwagen, with Becks, as it
appeared, by their side, and in order to be present at the bridal fetes at
lumpernickel.

The Major, who had seen the key of number 90 put up on ts hook,
and had heard the conversation of the two young university blood, was
not at a loss to understand that their talk related to Beck.  Tha
little devil is at her old tricks,'' he thought, and he smiled as he recalled
old days, when he had witnessed the desperate flirtation with Joy,
and the ludicrous end of that adventure. He and George had often
laughed over it subsequeutly, and until a few weeks after George'a
marriage, when he also was caught in the little Circe's toils, and had
an understanding with her which his comrade certainly suspected, but
preferred to ignore. William was too much hurt or ashamed to ask
to fathom that disgraceful mystery, although one, and evidently with
remorse on his mind, George had alluded to it. It was on the morning
of Waterloo as the young men stool together in front of their line,
surveying the black masses of Frenchmen who crowned the opposite

intrigue with a woman,'' George said. 'I am glad we were marched away.
If I drop, I hope Emmy will never know of that business. I wish to
Go it had never been begun'' And William, was pleased to think,
and had more than once soothed poor George's widow with the nor-
native, that Borne, after quitting his wife, and after the action of
uatre Brass, on the first day, spoke gravely und affeetionately to his cow-
made of his father and his wife. On these facts, too, William had insisted
very strongly in his conversations with the elder Scorned: and had thus
been the means of reconciling the old gentleman to his son's memory, just
at the close of the elder man's life.
``And so this devil is still going on with her intrigues,'' thought William.
I wish he were a hundred miles from here. She brings mischief
wherever she goes,'' And he was pursuing these forebodings and this
uncomfortable train of thought, with his hand between his hands, and
the `` Pumpernickel Gazette'' of last week unread under his nose, when
somebody tapped his shoulder with a parasol, and he looked up and saw
Mrs. Amelia.
This woman had a way of tyrannising over Major Doing (for the
nearest of all people will domineer over somebody), and she ordered him
about, and patted him, and made him fetch and carry just as if he was
great Newfoundland dog. He liked, so to speak, to jump into the water
if she said `` High, Sobbing'' and to trot behind her with her reticule in
his mouth. This history has been written to very little purpose if the
reader has not perceived that the MIajor was a spoon.
 WHy did you not wait for me, Sir, to escort me downstairs'' she said,
giving a little toss of her head, and a most sarcastic course.
I couldn't stand up in the passage,'' he answered, with a comical there-
story look; and, delighted to give her his arm, and to take her out of the
horrid smoky place, he would have walked off without even so much as
remembering the waiter, had not the young fellow run after him and
stopped him on the threshold of the Elephant to make him pay for the
beer which he had not consumed. Emmy laughed: she called him a
naughty man, who wanted to run away in debt; and, in fact, made some
jokes suitable to the occasion and the small-beer. She was in high spirits
and good humour, and tripped across the market-place very briskly. She
wanted to see Joy that instant. The Msjor laughed at the impetuous
affection Mrs. Amelia exhibited; for, in truth, it was not very often that
he wanted her brother ``that instant,''
They found the Civility in his saloon on the first for; he had been
pacing the room, and biting his nails, and looking over the market-place
towards the Elephant a hundred times at least during the past hour, whilst
Emmy was closed with her friend in the garret, and the Mnjor was beating
the tattoo on the sloppy tables of the public room below, and he was, on
his side too, very anxious to see Mrs. Borne.
 Well2'' said he.
 The poor dear creature, how she has suffered1'' Emmy said.
 God bless my soul, yes,'' Joy said, wagging his head, so thrusts
cheeks quivered like jellies.

She may have Payne's room ; who can go up stairs,'' Emmy continued.
Payne was a staid English maid and personal attendant upon Mrs. Sedley,
to whom the courier, as in duly bound, paid court, and whom George
see to `lark'' dreadfully with accounts of German robert and ghosts.
He passed her time chiefly in grumbling, in ordering about her mistress,
and in stating her intention to return the next morning to her native
village of Langham.  She may have Payne's room,'' Emmy said.

oF course we are,'' said Amelia in the most innocent way in the
world. ``Don't be angry, and break the furniture, Major Doing. Of
course we are going to have her here,''
Of yours, my dear,'' Joe said.
tHe poor creature, after all her sufferings,'' Emmy continued: `` her
horrid bnnker broken and run away : her husband-wicked wretch-having
deserted her and taken her child away from her (here she doubled her two
little fists and held them in a most menacing attitude before her, so that
the Mayor was charmed to see such a dauntless virago), the poor dear
thing quite alone and absolutely forced to give lessons in singing to get
her bread-and not have her here''
tAke lessons, my dear Mrs. George,'' cried the Msjor, `` but don't
have her in the house. I implore you don't.''
Pooh,'' said Joy.
 You who are always good and kind: always used to be at any rate:
I 'm astonished at you, Major William,'' Amelia cried. Why, what is
the moment to help her but when she is so miserable Now is the time
to be of service to her. The oldest friend i ever had, and not--''
 She was not always your friend, Amelia,'' the Mnjor said, for he was
quite angry. This allusion was too much for my, who looking the
Moor almost fiercely in the face, did  For shame, Moor Doing 1''
and, after having fired this shot, she walked out of the room with a
most majestic air, and shut her own door briskly on herself and her
outraged dignity.
 To allude to that'' she said, when the door was close. Oh it was
cruel of him to remind me of it,'' and she looked up at George's picture, which
hung there as usual, with the portrait of the boy underneath. 'It was
cruel of him. If I had forgiven it, ought he to have spoken: No. And
it is from his own lips that I know how wicked and groundless my jealousy
was; and that you were pure,-Oh yes, you were pure, my saint in
heaven''
She paced the room trembling and indignant. She went and leaned
on the chest of drawers over which the picture hung, and gazed and gazed
at it. Its eyes seemed to look down on her with a reproach that deepened
as she looked. The early dear, dear memories of that brief prime of love
rushed back upon her. The wound which years had scarcely cicatrised
bled afresh, and oh, how bitterly She could not bear the reproaches of
the husband there before her. It wouldn't be. Never, never.

constancy-raised too upon what secret and hidden foundations, wherein
lay buried passions, uneounted struggles, unknown sacrifices-a little word
was spoken, and down fell the fair palace of hope-one word, and away
flew the bird which he had been trying all his life to lure
William, though he was by Amelia's looks that a great crisis had
come, nevertheless continued to implore Sedley, in the most energetic
terms, to beware of Rebecca: and he eagerly, almost frantically, abjured
Joy not to receive her. DIe besought Mr, bSedley to inquire at least
regarding her: told him how he had heard that she was in the company of
brambles and people of ill repute: pointed out what evil she had done in
former days: how she and Crawled had misled poor George into ruin:
how she was now parted from her husband, by her own confession, and,
perhaps, for good reason. What a dangerous companion she would be for
his sister, who knew nothing of the affairs of the world1 William implored
Joy, with all the eloquence which he could bring to bear, and a great deal
more energy than this quiet gentleman was ordinarily in the habit of
showing, to keep Rebecca out of his household.
Had he been less violent, or more dexterously, he might have succeeded in
his supplications to Joy; at the Civility was not a little jealous of the
air of superiority which the Masjor constantly exhibited towards him, as
he fancied (indeed, he had imparted his opinions to Mr. skirts, the
courier, whose bills Mnjor Doing cheeked on this journey, and who sided
with his master), and he began a blustering speech about his competence
to defend his own honour, his desire not to have his affairs meddled with,
his intention, in fine, to rebel against the Mnjor, when the colloquy--
rather along and stormy one-was put an end to in the simplest way post-
sible, namely, by the arrival of Mrs. Beck, with a porter. from the
Elephant Hotel, in charge of her very meagre baggage.
She greeted her host with affectionate respect, and made a shrinking,
but amicnble, salutation to Major Doing, who, as her instinct assured her
at once, was her coney, and had been speaking against her; and the
bustle and clatter consequent upon her arrival brought Amelia out of her
room, who went up and embrace her guest with the greatest warmth, and
took no notice of the Mnjor, except to fling him an angry look-the most
unjust and scornful glance that had perhaps ever appeared in that poor
little woman's face since she was born. But she had private reasons
of her own, and was bent upon being angry with him. And Doing,
indignant at the injustice, not at the defeat, went off, making her a bow
quite as haughty as the killing course with which the little woman chose
to bid him farewell.
He being gone, EArly was particularly lively and affectionate to
Rebecca, and bustle about the npartments and installed her guest in her
room with an eagerness and activity seldom exhibited by our placid little
friend. But when an act of injustice is to be done, especially by weak
people, it is best that it should be done quickly ; and My thought she
was displaying a great deal of fairness and proper feeling and veneration
for the late Captain Borne in her present behaviour.

asked, with his usual simplicity of language. : Major Obtain is dining
out, I suppose,'' his mother said; and, drawing the boy to her, kissed him
a great deal, and put his hair off his forehead, and introduced him to Mrs.
Crawled.  This is my boy, Rebecea,'' Mrs. Borne said-as much as
to say-can the world produce anything like that Beck looked at him
with rapture, and pressed his hand fondly. ` Dear boy!'' she said-
``he is just like my-'' Emotion choked her further utterance; but
Amelia understood, as well as if she had spoken, that Beck was thinking
of her own blessed child. However, the company of her friend consoled
Mrs. Crawled, and she ate a very good dinner.
During the repast, she had occasion to speak several times, when
George eyed her and listened to her. At the dessert Emmy was gone out
to superintend further domestic arrangements: Joy was in his great chair
dozing over Malignant: George and the new arrival sat close to each
other : he had continued to look at her knowingly more than one, and
at last he laid down the nut-craekers.
I say,'' said George.
e What do you say'' they said, laughing.
You 're the lady I saw in the mask at the Rouge et Noir,''
 Hush 1 you little sly creature,'' Beck said, taking up his hand and
kissing it. `" Your uncle was there too, and mamma mustn't know,''
Oh no-not by no means,'' answered the little fellow,
 You see we are quite good friends already,'' Been said to Emmy, who
now re-entered; and it must be owned that Mrs. Borne had introduced
n most judicious and amiable companion into her house.
William, in a state of great indignation, though still unaware of all
the treason that was in store for him, walked about the town wildly until
he fell upon the Secretary of Question, Tapeworm, who invited him to
dinner. As they were discussing that meal, he took occasion to ask the
Secretary whether he knew anything about a certain Mrs, Rawdon Crawled,
who had, he believed, made some noise in London; and then Tapeworm,
who of course knew all the London gossip, and was besides a relative of
LAdy Gaunt, poured out into theastonished Major's ears such history about
Beck and her husband as astonished the request, and supplied all the
points of this narrative, for it was at that very table years ago that the
present writer had the pleasure of hearing the tale. Tufts, Street, the
Trawlers, and their history-everything connected with Beck and her
previous life passed under the record of the bitter diplomatist. He knew
everything and a great deal besides, about all the world;-in a word, he
made the most astounding revelations to the simple-hearted Major. When
Doing said that Mrs. Scorned and Mr. Sedley had taken her into their
house, he burst into a peal of laughter which shocked the Major, and
asked if they ll not better send into the prison, and take in one or two
of the gentlemen in shaved heads and yellow streets, who swept the
streets of Pumpernickel, chained in pairs, to board and lodge, and yet
as tutor to that little scapegrace George.
This information astonished and horrified the MArjory not a little. It had

been agreed in the morning (before meeting with Becomes) that Amelis
hould go to the Court ball that night. There would be the place to tell
her. The Major went home and dressed himself in his uniform, and
repaired to Court, in hopes to see Mrs. Borne. She never came. When
he returned to his lodgings all the lights in the Hedley tenement were put
out. He could not see her till the morning. I don't know what sort of
a night's rest he had with this frightful secret in bed with him.
At the earliest convenient hour in the morning he sent his servant
across the way with a note, saying, that he wished very particularly to
speak with her. A message came back to say, that Mrs. Borne was
exceedingly unwell, and was keeping her room.
She, too, had been awake all that night. She had been thinking of a
thing which had agitated her mind a hundred times before. A hundred
times on the point of yielding, she had shrunk back from a sacrifice
which she felt was too much for her. She couldn't, in spite of his love
and constancy, and her own acknowledged regard, respect, and gratitude.
What are benefits, what is conslanay, or meritP One curl of a girl's
ringlet, one hair of a whisper, will turn the scale against them all in
minute. They did not weigh with Emmy more than with other women.
She had tried them; wanted to make them pass; could not; and the
pitiless little woman had found a pretext, and determined to be free.
When at length, in the afternoon, the Msjor gained admission to Amelia,
instead of the cordial and affectionate greeting to which he had been
accustomed now for many a long day, he received the salutation of
course, and of a little loved hand, retraced the moment after it was
accorded to him.
Rebecca, too, was in the room, and advanced to meet him with a smile
and an extended hand. Doing drew back rather confusedly. `` I-I beg
your pardon, Ma'am,'' he said; `' but I am bound to tell you that it is not
as your friend that i am come here now,''
pOol damn; don't let us have this sort of thing'' Joy cried out,
alarmed, and anxious to get rid of a scene.
`I wonder what Major Doing has to say against Rebeecea?'' Ameli
said in a low, clear voice with a slight quiver in it, and a very determined
look about the eyes.
I will not have this sort of thing in my house,'' Joy again interposed.
:I say I will not have it : and Sobbing, I beg, Sir, you 'll stop it.'' And
he looked round trembling and turning very red, and gave a great puff,
and made for his door.
` Dear friend'' Rcbcecas said with angelic sweetness, `` do hear what
Major Doing has to say against me.''
:I will not hear it, I say,'' squeakd out Joy at the top of his voice,
and, gathering up his dressing-gown, was gone.
`We are only two women,'' Amelia said. ` you can speak now, Sir.''
 This manner towards me is one which scarcely becomes you, Amelia,''
the Major answered hnughtily; '`nor I believe am I guilty of habitual
harshess to women. It is not a pleasure to me to do the duty which I
am come to do,''

Amelia, who was more and more in a pet, The expression of Doing's face,
as she spoke in this imperious manner, was not pleasant.
I came to say-and as you stay, Mrs. Really, I must say it in your
presence-that I think you-you ought not to form a member of the
family of my friends. A lady who is separated from her husband, wha
travels not under her own name, who frequents public gazing-tables--''

-is not a fit companion for Mrs. Scorned and her son,'' Doing went
on : ``and I may and that there are people here who know you, and who
profess to know that regarding your conduct about which I don't even
wish to speak before-before Mrs. Borne.''
mAyor's is a very modest and convenient sort of calumny, Major
Doing,'' Rebecca said. :To leave me under the weight of an accusa-

maligned me. Is it of being poor, forsaken, wretched, that you aceuse
me Yes, i am guilty of those faults, and punished for them every day.
Let me go, Emmy. It is only to suppose that I have not met you, and I
am no worse to-day than IT was yesterday. It is only to suppose that the
night is her and the poor wanderer is on her way. Don't you remember
the song we used to sing in old, dear old days? I have been wandering
her since then-a poor castaway, scorned for being miserable, and insulted
because I am alone. Let me go: my last here interfered with the plans
of this gentleman.''
Indeed it does, Madam,'' said the Major.  If I have any authority
in this house--''
'Authority, none'' broke out Amelia.  Rebeeca, you stay with me.
I won't desert you, because you have been persecuted, or insult you,
because-because Major Doing chooses to do so. Come away, dear.''
And the two women made towards their door.
William opened it. As they were going out, however, he took Amelia's
hand, and sail--e Will you stay a moment and speak to me''
 He wishes to speak to you away from me,'' said Beck, looking like
a martyr. Amelia groped her hand in reply.
"Upon my honour it is not about you that I am going to speak,''
Doing said.  Come back, Amelia,'' and she came. being bowed to
Mrs. Crawled, as to shut the door upon her. Amelia looked at him,
leaning against the glass: her face and her lips were quite white.
I was confused when I spoke just on,'' the Major said, after a
pause; ``and I missed the word authority.''

yOu don't mean that, Amelia2'' william said, sadly. ``You don't
mean that these words, uttered in a hurried moment, are to weigh against
a whole life's devotion. I think that George's memory has not been
injured by the way in which I have dealt with it, and if we are come to
anything reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the mother
of his son. Reflect, afterwards when-when you are at leisure, and your
conscience will withdraw this accusation. It does even now,'' Amelia
held down her head.
It is not that speech of yesterday,'' he continued, ``' which moves you.
That is but the pretext, Amelia, or I have loved you and watched you far
fifteen years in vain. Have i not learned in that time to read all your
feelings, and look into your thoughts I know what your heart is
capable of: it can cling faithfully to a recollection, and cherish a fancy;
but it can't feel such an attachment as mine deserves to mate with, and
such as I would have won from a woman more generous than you.
No, you are not worthy of the love which I had devoted to you. I knew
all along that the prize I had set my life on was not worth the winning;
that I was a fool, with fond fancies, too, bartering away my all of truth
and ardour against your little feeble remnant of love. I will bargain no
more : I withdraw. I find no fault with you. You are very good-
natured, and have done your best; but you couldn't-you couldn't reach
up to the height of the attachment which I bore you, and which as loftier
soul than yours might have been proud to share. Good bye, AmeliaI I
have watched your struggle. Let it end. We are both weary of it.''
Amelia stood scared and silent as William thus suddenly broke the
chain by which she held him, and declared his independence and sure-
riority. He had placed himself at her feet so long that the poor little
woman had been accustomed to trample upon him. She didn't wish to
marry him, but she wished to keep him. She wished to give him nothing,
but that he should give her all. It is a bargain not unfrequently leied
in love.
William's sally had quite broken and cast her down. Her assault as
long since over and beaten back.
"Am I to understand then,-that you are going-away,-William 2''
she said.
He gave a sad laugh. `I went one before,'' he said, `' and came back
after twelve years. We were young then, Amelia. Good-bye. I have
spent enough of my life at this play.''
While they had been talking, the door into Mrs. Borne's room had
opened her so little; indeed, Beck had kept a hold of the handle
and had turned it on the instant when Doing quitted it; and she heard
every word of the conversation that had passed between these two,  What

The parting was over. Once more poor Willing walked to the door
and was gone; and the little widow, the author of all this work, had her
will, and had won her victory, and was left to enjoy it as she best might.

At the romantic hour of dinner Mr. George made his appearance, and
again remarked the absence of  Old bOb.'' 1he meal was eaten in ileucc
by the party; Joy's appetite not being diminished, but Emmy taking
nothing at all.
After the meal, George was lolling in the cushions of the old window,

commanding on one side the Market Place, where the Elcphant is, and in
front the opposite side of ` Goswell Street over the way,'' like the immortal

Emmy gave a little start but said nothing.

The boy stopped ; kicked about the room; jumped up and down from the
window-seat with his knees, and showed every symptom of unceasiness and
curiosity.

rushed down the stairs and flung across the street in a minute-the
yellow postilion was craeking his whip gently.
William had got into the carriage, release from the embraces of hi
landlord. George bounded in afterwards and flung his arms round the
Mayor's neck (s they saw from the window), and began asking him
multiplied questions. Then he felt in his waistcoat-pocket and gave him
a note. William seized at it rather eagerly, he opened it trembling, but
instantly his countenance changed, and he tore the paper in two and
dropped it out of the carriage. He kissed George on the head, and the
boy got out, doubling his fists into his eyes, and with the aid of Francis.

alone in the street, burst out crying in the face of all the crowd.
Emmy's mail heard him howling again during the night, and brought
him some preserved npricots to console him. She mingled her lamenta-
tions with his. All the poor, all the humble, all honest folks, all good men
who knew him, loved that kind-hearted and simple gentleman.
As for Emmy, had she not done her duty She had her picture of
George for a consolation.

dromedary, likes to repose sometimes under the date-trees by the water;
or to come into the cities, walk in the bazaar, fresh himself in the
baths, and say his prayers in the Mosques, before he goes out again

She picketted her steed, hung up her weapons, and warmed herself comfort-

soothing and pleasant to her.
So, pleased herself, she tried with all her might to please everybody,
and we know that she was eminent and successful as a practitioner in the
art of giving pleasure. As for Joy, even in that little interview in the

of his good will. In the course of a week, the civility was her sworn
slave and frantic almirer. He didn't go to sleep after dinner, as his
custom was, in the much less lively society of Amelia. He drove out
with her in his open carriage. He asked little parties and invented festivi-
ties to do her honour. lapeworm, the Secretary of Negation, who had
nbused her so cruelly, came to dine with Joy, and then came every day to
pay his respects to Beck. Poor Emmy, who was never very tualkative,
and more glum and silent than ever after Doing's departure, was quite
forgotten when this superior genius made her appearance. The fRench
Minister was as much charmed with her as his English rival. The
German ladies, never particularly squeamish as regards morals, especially
in english people, were delighted with the cleverness and it of MRs.
Borne's charming friend; and though she did not ask to go to Court,
yet the most august and TRansparent Peraonages there heard of her face-
nations, and were quite curious to know her. When it became known
that she was noble, of an ancient English family, that her husband was
Colonel of the Guard, Excellent and Governor of an island, only separated
from his lady by one of those trifling differences which are of little account
in a country where  Werther'' is still rend, and the  WYhlerwand-
schaftcn'' of Goethe is considered an edifying moral book ; nobody thought
of refusing to receive her in the very highest society of the little they,
and the ladies were even more ready to call her d, and to swear eternal
friendship for her, than they had been to bestow the same inestimable
benefits upon Amelin. Love and Liberty are interpreted by those simple
Gcrmans in a way which honest folks in lorkshire and Somersetshire little
understand, and a lady might, in some philosophic and cisilised towns,
e divorced ever so many times from her respective husbands, and keep
her character in society. Joy's house never was so pleasant, since he
had a house of his own, as Rebecca caused it to be. She sung, she
played, she laughed, she talked in two or three languages, she brought
every body to the house, and she male Joy believe that it was his own
great social talents and with which gathered the great society of the place
round about him.
As for Emmy, who found herself not in the least mistress of cr own
house, except when the bills were to he paid, Beck soon discovered the
way to soothe and please her. She talked to her perpetually about MIajor
Doing sent about his business, and mile no scruple of leclaring her

to the Domain subject a score of times every day.

him from the presence of her mistress, she was reconciled to Mrs, Curled
subsequently, because the latter become William's most ardent admirer
nd champion. And in these mighty concerns in which the two ladies
indulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne was `` brushing their
'airs,'' as she called the yellow looks of the one, and the soft brown dresses
of the other, this girl always put in her word for that dear good gentleman
Mnjor Doing. Her advocacy did not make Amelia angry any mere than
Rebecca's admiration of him. She made George write to him constantly,
and persisted in ending Mamma's kind love in a postscript. And as she
looked at her husband's portrait of nights, it no longer reproached her-
perhaps she repronched it, now William was gone.
Emmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice. She was very
dieteraite, nervous, silent, and ill to please. The family had never known
her so peevish. She grew pale and ill. She used to try and sing her-
thin songs, ( Begins bin ich night valence,'' was one of them; that
tender love-song of Water's, which, in old-fashioned days, young ladies,
and when you were scarcely born, showed that those who lived before you
knew too how to love and to sing);-certain songs, I say, to which the
Mayor was partial; and as she wnrbled them in the twilight in the drawing-
room, she would break off in the midst of the song, and walk into hen
neighbouring apartment, and there, to doubt, take refuge in the signature
of her husband.
Some books still subsisted, after Doing's departure, with his name
written in them; a German bDictionary, for instance, with  William bOb-
bin, -th leg.,'' in the fly-leaf; a guile-book with his initinls, and one or
two other volumes which belonged to the Mnjor. eMpty cleared these
away, and put them on the drawers, where she placed her work-box, her
desk, her Bible, and Prayer-book, under the pictures of the two Georges.
And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind him, it is a
feet that George, rummaging his mother's desk sometime afterwards,
found the gloves neatly filled up, and put away in what they call the
secret drawers of the desk.
Not caring for society, and moping there a great deal, Emmy's chief
pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with George (during
which Rebcccn was left to the society of Mr. Joseph), and then the mother
and son used to talk about the MIajor in a way which en made the boy
smile. She told him that she thought Minor William was the best man
in all the world ; the gentlest and the kindest, the brave, and the humblest.
Over and over again, she told him how they owed everything which they
possessed in the world to that kind friend's benevolent care of them;
how he had befrienled them all through their poverty and misfortunes;
watched her them when nobody cared for them; how all his comrades
admired him though he never spoke of his own gllant actions; how
George's father trusted him beyond all other men, and had been con-
instant befriended by the good Willing.  Why, when your Papa was
little boy,'' she said,  he often told me that it was William who defended
him against a tyrant at the school where they were; and their friendship
never ceases from that lay until the last, when your dear father fell,''

he, Mother When I'm in the army, won't I hate the French:-
that 's all.''
In such colloquies the mother and the child passed a great deal of their
time together. The artless woman had made a confidant of the boy. He
was as much William's friend as everybody else who knew him well.
By the way, Mrs. Body, not to be behind-hand in sentiment, hal got
n miniature too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amusement
of most people, and the delight of the original, who was no other than
one friend Joy. On her first coming to favour the Shelves with a visit,
the little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably all shabby kit, was
perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and band-boxes, and often
spoke with great respect about her baggnge left behind at Leipzig, which
she must have from that city. WHen a traveller talks to you perpetually
about the splendour of his luggage, which he does not happen to have
with him; my son, beware of that traveller He is, ten to one, an
impostor.
Neither Joy nor Emmy knew this important maxim. It seemed to them
of no consequence whether Been had a quantity of very one clothes in
invisible trunks; but as her present supply was exceedingly shall,
Emmy supplied her out of her own stores, or took her to the best illiner
in the town, and there fitted her out. It was no more torn collars not, I
promise you, and faded silks trailing off at the shoulder. Been changed
her habits with her situation in life-the rouge-pot was suspended-
other excitement to which she had accustomed herself was also put aside,
or at least only indulged in in privacy ; as when she was prevailed on by
Joy of a summer evening, EArly and the boy being absent on their walks,
to take a little spirit-and-water. But if she did not indulge-the corner
lid : that rascal Skirts could not be kept from the bottle; nor could he
tell how much he took when he applied to it. He was sometimes surprised
himself at the way in which Mr. Sedley's Contact diminishel. Well, well;
this is a painful subject. Beck did not very likely indulge so much as
she used before he entered a dormouse family.
At last the much-bragged about boxes arrived from Lcipzig ;-three of
them not by any means large or splendid ;-nor did Beck appear to take
out any sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did arrive.
But out of one, which contained a mass of her papers (it was that very
box which none Crawled had ransacked in his furious hunt for Beck's
concealed money), she took a picture with great glce, wsluich she pined p
in her room, and to which she introduced Joy. It was the portrait of s

That evening's conversation was delicious, for Joy. Emmy only
came in to go to be very tired and unwell. Joy and his fair guest
had a charming that-i-time and his sister could hear, as she lay awake
in her adjoining chamber, lcbecca singing over to Joy the old songs
of 1815. He did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, any more than
Amelia.
It was June, and, y consequence, light season in London,; Joy, who
read the incomparable '' Malignant'' (the exile's best friceul) through every
la, used to favour the ladies with extraets from his paper during their
breakfast. Every week in this paper there is a full account of military
movements, in which Joy, as a man who had seen service, was especially
interested. On one occasion he read out-`Arrival of the -th regiment.
-Traversed, June 20.-The llamchunder, Fast Indimuan, came into the
river this morning, having on brown 14 oflicers, and 132 rank and file

having been entered the year after Waterloo, in which glorious conflict
they took an active part, and having subsequently distinguished them-

as they went into Waste's hotel, where a impetuous banquet was provided
for the defender of Old England. During the repast, which we need not
say was served up in Waste's best style, the clearing continued so
enthusiastically, that Lady O'Down and the Colonel came forward to the
balcony, and drank the health of the fellow-countrymen in a number of
Water's best claret.''
On a second occasion Joy rend a brief announcement-MIajor Doing hal
joined the-th regiment at Chatham; and subsequently he prulgated
accounts of the presentations at the Drawing-room, of Colonel Sir
Michael O'Down, K.C.lL., Indy O'Down (by Mrs. Million Million ol
Ballymalony), and Miss Georgina O'Down (by Lady O'DOwn). Almost
directly after this, Doing's name appeared among te Lieutenant-
Colonel : for old Marshal Tiptoff had died during the pussge of the
--th from Madrs, and the Sovereign was pleased to advance Colonel Sir
Michael O'Down to the rank of Major-General on his return to England,
with an intimation that he should be Colonel of the distinguished rcgiment

correspondence between George and his guardian had not ceased by any
venus: William had even written once or twice to her since his departure,
but in a manner so uneonstrainedly cold, that the poor woman felt now in her
turn that she had lost her power over him, and that, as he had said, he was
free. he had left her, and she was wretched. The memory of his almost
countless services, and lofty and affectionate regard, now presented itself
to her, and rebuke her day and night. She brooded over those college-
tions according to her wont; saw the purity and beauty of the affection
with which she had trifled, and reproaehed herself for having flung away
such a treasure.
It was gone indeed. William lad spent it all out. He loved her no
more, he thought, as he had loved her. He never could again. That
sort of regard, which he all proffered to her for so many faithful years, can't
be flung down and shattered, and mended so as to show no stars. The
little heedless tyrant hal so destroyed it. No, William thought again
and again, `` It was myself I deluded, and persisted in cajoling: had she
been worthy of the love I gave her, she would have returned it long ago.
It was a fond mistake. Isn't the whole course of life made up of such
and suppose I had won her, should I not have been disenchanted the day
after my victory Why pine, or be ashamed of my defeat?'' The more
he thought of this long passage of his life, the more clearly he saw his
deception. ``1'll go into hamness again,'' he said, ``and do my duty in that
state of life in which it has pleased Heaven to place me. I will see that the
buttons of the reeruits are properly bright, and that the servants make
no mistakes in their accounts. I will dine at mess, and listen to the
Scotch surgeon telling his stories. When I am old and broke, I will go
on half-pay, and my old sisters shall scold me. I have ` geliebt and

After June all the little Court Society of Pumpernickel used to sea-
rate, according to the German plan, and make for a hundred watering-
places, where they drank at the wells; rode upon donkeys; gnmbled at the
reasons, if they had money and a mind; rushed with hundreds of their
kind, to gormandise at the tales d '6die , and idle away the summer. The
eNglish diplomtists went off to oeplitz and Missing, their French rivals
shut up their clanucellerie and whisked away to their darling Bouleard de

time periods of the Doctor's practice-he united business with pleasure,
and his chief place of resort was Ostend, which is such frequented by
Germans, and where the dOctor treated himself and his spouse to what he
called a `'did'' in the sea.
His interesting patient, Joy, was a regular milch cow to the Doctor, and he
easily persuaded the civility, both for his own hell's sake and that of his
charming sister, which was really very much flattered, to pass the summer
nt that hideous seaport town. eMpty did not care where she went much
George jump at the idea of a move. As for l3eyes, she came as a
matter of course in the fourth place inside of the fine barouche Mr. Joy had
sought: the two domestic being on the box in Front. She might have
sone misgivings about the friends whom she should meet there, and who
might be likely to tell ugly stories-but, ball she was strong enough to hold
her own. She had cast such an anchor in Joy now as would require n strong
storm to she. That incident of the picture hnl finished him. Beck
took down her elephant, and put it into the little box which she had had
from Amelia ever so many years ago. Emmy also came off with her Wares,
-her two pictures,-and the party, finally, were lodged in an exceedingly
dear and uncomfortable house at Osted.
There Amelia began to take baths, ll get what good she could from
them, and though scores of people of Beck's nequaiutance passed er and
cut her, yet Mrs. Borne, who walked about with her, and who knew
nobody, was not aware of the treatment experienced by the friend whom
she had chosen so judiciously as a companion ; indeed, Beck never thought
fit to tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes.
sOme of MRs. Rawdon Crawled's acquaintances, however, acknowledge
her readily chough,-perhaps ore readily than she would have desired.
Among these were Moor Lover (unattachel), and Acting Rook (late of the
Ritles), who might be seen any day on the Duke, smoking and staring
at the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable
board and select circle of Mr. Joseph Sedley. In fact, they would
take no denial; they burst into the house whether Beck was at home or
not, walked into MRs. Colonel's drawing-room, which they perfumed with
their coats nnl mustachios, called Joy : Old back,'' and invaded lis
dinner-table, and laughed and drank for long hours there.
 What can they mean'' asked George, who did not like these gentle-
men. `I heard the Major say to Mrs. Crawled yesterday, ` No,no, lUcky,
you shan't keep the old back to yourself, We must have the bones in,
or, dmmy, 1 'll split.' What could the MOor mean, MIa2''
v Majorl don't call Him Majorl'' may said. I 'm sure I can't
tell what he meant.'' His presence and that of his friend inspired the
little lady with intolerable terror and aversion. They paid her tipsy come-
elements; they peered at her over the dinner-table. and the Captain made
her advances that filled her with sickening dismay, nor would she ever see
him unless she had George by her side.
Rebecca, also, to do her justice, never would let either of these men
remain alone with Mmelia; the Major was disengaged too, and swore he
would be the winter of her. A couple of ruffinns were fighting for this

innocent creature, gambling for her at her own table; and though she
was not aware of the rascals' designs upon her, yet she felt a horror and
uneasincss in their presence, and longed to fly.
She besought, she entreated Joy to come home. Not he. He was
low of movement, tied to his Doctor, and perhaps to some other leading-
things. At least Back was not anxious to go to England.
At last she took a great resolution-made the great plunge. She wrote
of a letter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water; a
letter about which she did not speak a word to anybody, which she carried
herself to the post under her shawl, nor was any remark made about it;
curly that she looked very much flushed and agitated when George met
her ; and she kissed him al hung over him a great deal that night. She
did not come out of her room after her return from her walk. Beck
thought it was MInor Lover and the Captain who frightened her.
`She mustn 't stop here,'' Beck reasoned with herself, `She must go
away, the silly little fool. She is still whimpering after that gay of
husband-dead, (and seed right.) these fifteen years. She shan't marry
either of these men. It's too bad of Lover. No; she shall marry the
blood-one, I 'll settle it this very night.''
So Bocky took a cup of tea to Hamlin in her private apartment, and
found that lady in the company of her miniatures, and in a most melancholy
and nervous condition. She laid down the cup of tea.
Thank you,'' said Amelia.
 LIsten to me, Mmelia,'' said they, marching up and down the room
before the other, and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous kindness.
I want to talk you. You must go away from here and from the period-
nences of these men. I won't have you harassed by them; and they will
insult you if you stay. I tell you they are rascals; men fit to send to the
hands. Never mind how I know them. I know everybody. Joy can't

you a hundred times, and you have rejected him, you silly, heartless,
grateful little creature .''
I tried-I tried my best, indeed I did, Recall,'' said Amelia, there-
catingly, but I could 'not forget -;'' and she finished the sentence by
looking up at the portrait.
Could 'not forget him / '' cried out Beck, ``tlt selfish humbug, that
low-bred mockery-dandy, that added booby, who had neither wit, nor
manners, nor heart, and was no more to be compared to your friend with
the bamboo-anne than you are to been Elizabeth. Why, the man was
care of you, and would have jilted you, but that Doing forced him to
keep his word. He owned it to me. He never cared for you. He used
to sneer about you to me, time after time; and made love to me the week
after he married you.''
 I'a false. It's face. Rebecca,'' cried out Amelia, starting up.

and taking a little paper out of her belt, she opened it and flung it into
Emmy's lap. ` You know his hand-writing. He wrote that toe-wanted
me to run away with him-gave it me under your nose, the day before
he was shot-and served him right.'' Been repeated.
Emmy did not hear her; she was looking at the letter. It was that
which George had put into the bouquet and given to Beck on the night
of the Duke of kiclunond's ball. It was as she said : the foolish young
man hal asked her to fly.
Emmy's head sank down, and for almost the last time in which she shall
be called upon to weep in this history, she commenced that work. Her
head fell to her bosom, and her hands went up to her eyes; and there for
while, she gave way to her emotions, as SIckly stood on and regarded her.
WHo shall analyse those tears, and say whether they were sweet or
bitter Was she most grieved, because the idol of her life was tumbled
down and shivered at her feet, or indignant that lcr love had been so
despised, or glad because the barrier was removed which modcsty had
placed between her and a new, a real affection ` There is nothing to
forbid me now,'' she thought.  lI may love him with all my heart now.
O, I will, I will, if he will but let me, and forgive me.'' I believe it was
this feeling rushed over all the others which agitated that gentle little
bosom.
Indeed, she did not cry so much as Beck expected-the other soothed
and kissed her-a rare mark of sympathy with Mrs. Beck. She treated
Emmy like a child, and patted her head. ``And now let us get pen and
ink, aid write to him to come this minute,'' she said.
'I-I wrote to him this morning,'' Emmy soil, blushing exceedingly.
Body screamed with laughter-` A iglielto,'' she sang out with
Cousin, `' colour up /''-the-whole house echoed with her still singing.
Two mornings after this little scene, although the day was rainy and
gsty, and Amelia had had no exceedingly wakelul night, listening to the
wind ronring, and pitying all travellers by land and by water, yet she got
up early, and insisted upon taking a walk on the Duke with George; and
there she faced as the rain but into her face, and she looked out west-
ward across the dark sea line, and over the swollen billows which came
tumbling and farthing to the shore. Neither spoke much, except now
and then, when the boy said few words to his timid companion, indicated
of sympathy and protection.
iI hope he won't cross in such weather,'' Emmy said.
:I et ten to one he does,'' the boy answered.  Look, mother,
there's the smoke of the steamer,'' It was that signal, sure enough.
But though the steamer was under weigh, he might not be on board;
he might not have got the letter; he might not choose to come.-Hundred
fears poured one over the other into the little heart, as fast as the waves
on to the Duke.
The boat followed the smoke into sight. George had a dandy telescope,
and got the vessel under view in the most skilful manner. And he made

he signal of an English stenmer in sight went fluttering up to the most
on the pier. I dare say MIss. Amelia's heart was in a similar flutter.
eMpty tried to look through the telescope over George's shoulder, but:
she could make nothing of it. he only saw a black eclipse sobbing up
and down before her eyes.
George took the glass again and raked the vessel. e Ho she does
pitch.'' he said.  There goes a wave slap over her bows. There's only
two people on deck besides the steersman. There's a man lying down.

clapped to the telescope and flung his arms round his mother. As for thE
lady : let us say what she did in the words of a favourite poet-Aapes
yaeaea. She was sure it was William. It could be no other. WHY:
she had said about hoping that he would not come was all hypocrisy.
Of course he would come: what could he do else but come She knew
he would come.
The ship came swiftly nearer and nearer. As they went in to make
her at the landing-place at the day, Emmy's knees trembled so that s
scarcely could run. She would have liked to kneel down and say or
prayers of thanks there. Oh, she thought, she would be all her lit
saying them l
It was such n and day that as the vessel came alongside of the way
there were no idlers abroad; scarcely even a commissioner on the look-out
for the few passengers in the steamer. That young scape-grace George
had fled too: and as the gentleman in the old cloak lined with red st
stepped on to the short, there was scarcely any one present to see what
took place, which was briefly this:
A lady in a dripping white bonnet and shawl, with her two little had
not before her, went up to him, and in the next minute she had altogether
disappeared under the folds of the old clock, and was kissing one of his
hands with all her might; whilst the other, I suppose, was engaged in
holding her to his heart (which her had just about reached) and in pre-

tender love and pity. She understood its reproach, and hung don
her head.

tO, never,'' he answered: and pressed the dear little soul once more
to his heart.
As they issued out of the Custom-house precincts, George broke out of
them, with his telescope up to his eye, and a loud laugh of welcome; he
danced round the couple, and performed many facetious antics as he let
them up to the house. Joy wasn't up yet; Beck not visible (though
she looked at them through the blinds). George ran off to see but

Perhaps it was compunction towards the kind and simple creature, who
had been the first in life to defend her, perhaps it was a dislike to all such
sentimental scenes,-but Rebeeca, satisfied with her part in the transaction,
never presented herself before Colonel Doing and the lady whom he
married. ``Particular business,'' she said, took her to Bruges, without
she went; and only George and his uncle were present at the marriage
ceremony. When it was over, and george had rejoined his parents, Mrs.
lUcky returned (just for a few days) to comfort the solitary bchelor
Joseph Sedley. He preferred a continental life, he said, and declined to
join in housekeeping with his sister and her husband.
Man was very glad in her heart to think that she hnl written to her
husband before she read or knew of that letter of George's. I knew it
all along,'' William said; ``but could I use that weapon against the poor
fellow's memory? It was that which made me suffer so when you--''
 Never speak of that day again,'' EMpty cried out, so contrite and
humble, the William turned oil the conversation, by his account of Glorvina
and lear old Perry O'Down, with whom he was sitting when the letter
of recall reached him. `' If you hadn 't sent for me,'' he added with a
laugh, `` who knows what Glorvina's name might e now ''
At present it is Glorvina l'sky (now Mrs. Major Posky), she took him
on the death of his first wife; having resolved never to marry out of
the regiucnt. Lady O'Down is also so attached to it that, she says, if
anything were to happen to Pick, bell she'do come back and marry some

their neighbour, HIoggarty of Cast Haggard) he is the first man of his

MAster of the Close at the Lord ILieulenant's last ball. BOth she and
Glorvina declared that Doing had used the latter sea/lay, but sky
falling in, Glorvina was consoled, and  beautiful turn for paris

When Colonel Dobbiu quitted the science, which he did immediately
after his marriage, he rested a pretty little country place in Iapshire,

VANITY FIT.
n6t far from queen's Crawled, where, after the passing of the Reforn
Bill, Sir Pitt and his family constantly resided now. Falside of a Peerage
was out of the question, the baronet's two seats in Parliament being lost.
He was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that catastrophe, failed in
his health, and prophesied the speedy ruin of the Empire.
Lady Jane and MRs. Doing became great friends-there was a perpetual
crossing of pout-chaises between the Hall and the Evergreens, the Lo-
new's place (rested of his friend Moor Poor, who was brown with his
family.) Her Ladyship was gomother to Mrs. Doing's child, which
bore her name, and one christened by the Red. James Crawled, wha
succeeded his father in the living: and a pretty close friendship subsisted
between the two ends, George and Rawson, who hunted and shot together
in the vacations, were both entered of the same College at Cambridge, and
quarrelled with each other about Lady Jane's daughter, with whom they
were both, of course, in love. A match between George and that young
lady was long a favourite scheme of both the matrons, though I have heard
that MIss Crawled herself inclined towards her cousin.
Mrs. down Crawled's name was never mentioned by either family.
There were reasons why all should be silent regarding her. For wherever
Mr. Josepl Sedley went, she travelled likewise; and that infatuated man
seemed to be entirely her slate. The Colonel's lawyers informed him that
is brother-in-law had effectel n leave insurancee upon his life, whence it
as probable that he had been raising money to discharge debts. DIe
proeured prolonged leave of absence from the East India House, and
indeed his infirmities were daily increasing.
On hearing the news about the insuranee, Amelia, in a good deal of
alarm, entreated her husband to go to Brussels, where Joy then was, and
inquire into the state of his first. The Colonel quitted home with
reluctance (For he was deeply immersed in his ' HIstory of the Punjaub,''
which still occupies him, and much alarmed about his little daughter,
whom he idolizes, and who was just recovering from the chicken-box), and
went to Brussels and found Joy living at one of the enormous hotels in
that city. Mrs, Crawled, who had her carriage, gave entertainment, and
lived in a very genteel manner, occupied another suite of apartments in the
same hotel.
The Colonel, of course, did not desire to see that lady, or even think
proper to notify his arrival at Brussels, except privately to Joy by a
message through his valet. Joy begged the Colonel to come and see him
that night, when Mrs. Crawled would be at a satire, and when they could
meet alone. He found his brother-in-law in a condition of pitiable infir-
pity; and dreadfully afraid of Rebecca, though eager in his praises of her.
She tended him through a series of unheard-of illuesses, with a fidelity
most admnirable. She had been a daughter to him.  But-but-oh for
God's sake, do come and live near me, and-and-see me sometimes,''
whispered out the unfortunate man.
The Colonel's brow darkened at this. We can't, Joy,'' he said.
' Considering the circumstances, Amelia can't visit you.''
I swear to you-I swear to you on the Bible,'' gasped out Joseph,

wanting to kiss the book, `` that she is as innocent as a child, as spotless
as your own wife,''
 It may be so,'' said the Colonel, gloomily; ``but Emmy can't come
to you. Be a man, Joy: break off this disreputable connexion. Come
home to your family. We hear your affairs are involved.''
'Involved1'' cried Is.  Who has told such calumnious? All my
money is placed out most advantageously. is. Crawled-that is-I
mean,-it is laid out to the best interest.''
 You are not in debt then Why did you injure your if9 ''
 I thought-a little present to her-in case anything happened ; and
you know my health is so delicate-common gratitude you know-and I
intend to leave all my come to you-and I can spare it out of my income,
indeed Can,'' cried it William's weak brother-in-law.
The Colonel besought as to fly at once-to go hawk to India, whither
MRs. Railway could not follow him; to do anything to breakoff a con-
action which might have the best fatal consequences to him.
Joy clasped his hands, and said,- He would go back to Iudia.  He
would do anything: only he must have time: they must'nt say anything
to MRs. Crawled :-he'd-she'd kill me if who knew it. you don't know
what a terrible woman she is,'' the poor wretch said.
 Then, why net came away with me'' said Dobin in reply; but Joy
had not the courage.'  He would see Doing again in the morning; he
must on no account say that had been there. he must go now. Beck
ight come in.'' And Daring quitted him full of forebodings.
He never saw los more. Three months afterwards Joseph wIsely died at
Six-la-Chapelle. It was found that all his property lad been muddled away
in speculations, and was represented by valueless shares in different bubble
companion. All his available assets woe the two thousand pounds for
which his life was isured, and which were left equally between his beloved
``sister Amclia, wife of, &c., and his friend and invalusble attendant during
sickness, Rebecca, wife of Lieutennnt-Colonel selldon Called, C.,'' who
was appointed administratrix.
The solicitor of the Ignorance Company swore it was the blackest case
that ever had come before him; talked of sending a commission to Air to
same into the death, nd the Company refused paint of the policy.
But Mrs., or Lady Crawled, s she slylecl herself, time to town at once
(attended with her iolicitors, Masses. Burke, Thurtell, and Always, it
Heavier Inn,) and dared the Company to refuse the payment. They invited
examination. they declared that she was the object of nan infamous conspiracy,
which had been pursuing her all through life, and triumphed finally. The
money was said, and her character established, but Colonel Doing sent
back his share of the legacy to the Insuranee Office, and rigidly declined to
hold any communion with Rebecea.
She never was Lady Crawled, though she continued so to call herself.
His Excellent Colonel Rawdon Course died of yellow fever st Coventry
Island, most deeply beloved and deplored, and six weeks before the demise
of his brother, Sir Pitt. The estate consequently depend upon the
present Sir Rawdon Crawled, Part.

PITY FAIR.
He, too, has declined to see his mother, to whom he makes a liberal allow-
once; and who, besides, appears to be very wealthy. The Baronet lives
entirely at queen's Crawled, with Lady Jane and her daughter; whilst
ltebecca, Lady Crawled, chiefly hangs about Bath and Cheltenham, where a
very strong party of excellent people consider her to be a most injured
woman. She has her enemies. Who has not Her life is her answer to
them. She buries herself in works of piety. She goes to church, and never
without a footman. Her name is in all the Charity Lists. The Destitute
Oruge-girl, the Neglected Washerroman, the Distressed Musing-man, find
in her a fast and generous friend. She is always having calls at Fancy
1Fairs for the benefit of these hapless beings. Emmy, her children, and the
Colonel, coming to London some time back, found themselves suddenly
before her at one of these fairs. She cast down her eyes demurely and
smiled as they started away from her; Emmy skurrying off on the arm of
George, (now grown a dashing young gentleman,) and the Colonel seizing
up his little Jane, of whom he is fonder than of anything in the world-
older even than of his ` History of the Punjaub.''
Fonder than he is of me,'' Emmy thinks, with a sigh. But he never
said a word to Amelia that was not kind and gentle; or thought of a
want of her that he did not try to gratify.
Ah wants Panitatan  Which of us is happy in this world Which
of us has his desire or, having it, is satisfied 2-Come children, let us
shut up the boys and the puppels, for our play is played out.
