, O
as O

that O

Now O
, O
Miss O
Amelia BPERSON
Sedley IPERSON
was O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
this O
singular O


species O
; O
and O
deserved O
not O
only O
all O
that O
Miss O
Pinkerton BPERSON
said O
in O
her O
praise O
, O
 O


but O
had O
many O
charming O
qualities O
which O
that O
pompous O

Minerva BPERSON

not O
sce O
, O
from O
the O
differences O
of O

between O

pupil O

For O
she O
could O
not O
only O
sing O

a O

, O
or O
a O
Mrs. O
Billington BPERSON
, O
and O
dance O


like O
Hillisberg BGPE

Parisot O
; O
and O
embroider O
beautifully O
; O
and O
spell O
as O
well O
as O


the O
Dixonary O
itself O
; O
but O
she O
had O
such O
a O
kindly O
, O
smiling O
, O
tender O
, O
gentle O
, O


generous O
heart O
of O
her O
own O
, O
as O
won O
the O

of O
everybody O
who O
came O

her O
, O
from O
Minerva BPERSON
herself O
down O

the O

Miss BPERSON

Miss O

was O

from O
the O
high O

eminent O


virtues O
of O
that O
lady O
, O
calm O
and O
dignified O
; O
but O
Miss O
Jemima BPERSON
had O
already O


blubbered O
several O
times O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Amelia BPERSON
’s O
departure O
; O
and O
, O
but O
for O
fear O


of O
her O
sister O
, O
would O
have O
gone O
off O
in O
downright O
hysterics O
, O
like O
the O
heiress O


( O
who O
paid O
double O
) O
of O
St. BGPE
Kitt IGPE
’s IGPE
. O
Such O
luxury O
of O
grief O
, O
however O
, O
is O
only O


allowed O
to O
parlour O
 O

Honest O
Jemima BPERSON
had O
all O
the O

, O
and O
the O


washing O

the O
mending O

the O
puddings O
, O
and O
the O
plate O
and O
crockery O
, O


and O
the O
servants O
to O
superintend O
. O
But O
why O
speak O
about O
her O
? O
It O
is O


probable O
that O
we O
shall O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
again O
from O
this O
moment O
to O
the O
end O


of O
time O

and O
that O
when O
the O
great O
filligree O

are O
once O
closed O
on O


her O

she O
and O
her O
awful O

never O

this O
little O


world O

But O
as O
we O
are O
to O
see O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Amelia BPERSON

there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
saying O


at O
the O
outset O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
that O
she O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
and O
dearest O


creatures O
that O
ever O
lived O
; O
and O
a O
great O
mercy O
it O
is O
, O
both O
in O
life O
and O
in O


novels O
, O
which O
( O
and O
the O

abound O
in O
villains O

As O

no O

indeed O

her O

Even O
Miss BPERSON

ceased O

Miss O

young O

countenance O
, O
which O
had O
before O
worn O
an O
almost O
livid O
look O


of O
hatred O
, O
assumed O
a O
smile O
that O
perhaps O
was O
scarcely O


more O
agreeable O

and O
she O
sank O
back O
in O
the O
carriage O

an O

Miss O
Sedley BPERSON
was O
almost O
as O
flurried O
at O
the O
act O
of O
defiance O
as O
Miss O
Jemima BPERSON


had O
been O
; O
for O
, O
consider O
, O
it O
was O
but O
one BTIME
minute ITIME
that O

left O

with O
some O

of O

I O

an O

said O


to O

one BTIME
morning ITIME
at O

with O
a O
very O
agitated O
countenance O

 O
I O


dreamed O
last BTIME
night ITIME
that O
I O
was O
flogged O

Dr. O

 O

carried O

the O

that BTIME

Dr. O
Raine BPERSON
and O


his O

were O
just O
as O
awful O
to O
him O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
then O
, O
at O
sixty BCARDINAL
 ICARDINAL
eight ICARDINAL
, O
as O
they O


had O
been O
at O

If O
the O

with O

had O
appeared O


bodily O
to O
him O
, O
even O
at O
the O
age O
of O
threescore O

had O
said O
in O


awful O

‘ O

? O
 O
Well O

Miss BPERSON

 O
How O
could O
you O
do O
so O
, O
Rebecca BPERSON

 O
at O

she O
said O

after O
a O
pause O

 O
Why O
, O
do O
you O
think O
Miss O

will O
come O
out O

with O

 O
Why O

the O

 O
cried O
Miss O

laughing O

 O
He O
may O
go O

Miss O

that O
talking O

was O

it O

She O
does O

know O
a O
word O
of O

and O
was O


too O
proud O
to O
confess O
it O

I O
believe O
it O
was O
that O
which O
made O

 O
O O
Rebecca BPERSON
, O
Rebecca BPERSON
, O
for O
shame O
! O
 O
cried O
Miss O
Sedley BPERSON
; O
for O
this O
was O


the O
greatest O
blasphemy O
Rebecca BPERSON
had O
as O
yet O
uttered O
; O
and O
in O
those BDATE
days IDATE
, O
in O


England BGPE
, O
to O
say O
‘ O
‘ O
Long O

 O
‘ O
How O

Revenge O
may O

it O

 O
answered O
Miss O

 O
T’m O
no O
angel O

 O
And O
, O
to O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
she O
certainly O
was O
not O
. O



For O
it O
may O
be O
remarked O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
little O
conversation O
( O
which O


took O
place O
as O
the O
coach O
rolled O
along O
lazily O
by O
the O
river O
side O
) O
that O
though O


Miss O
Rebecca BPERSON
Sharp IPERSON
has O
twice O
had O
occasion O
to O
thank O
Heaven O
, O
it O
has O
been O
, O


in O
the O
first BORDINAL
place O
, O
for O
ridding O
her O
of O
some O
person O
whom O
she O
hated O
, O
and O


secondly BORDINAL
, O
for O
enabling O
her O
to O
bring O
her O
enemies O
to O
some O
sort O
of O
perplexity O


or O
confusion O
; O
neither O
of O
which O
are O
very O
amiable O
motives O
for O
religious O


gratitude O
, O
or O
such O
as O
would O
be O
put O
forward O
by O
persons O
of O
a O
kind O
and O


placable O
disposition O
. O
Miss O
Rebecca BPERSON
was O
not O
, O
then O
, O
in O
the O
least O
kind O
or O


placable O
. O
All O
the O
world O
used O
her O
ill O
, O
said O
this O
young O
misanthropist BNORP
( O
or O


tnisogynist O
, O
for O
of O
the O
world O
of O
men O
she O
can O
be O
pronounced O
as O
yet O
to O
have O


had O
but O
little O
experience O
) O
, O
and O
we O
may O
be O
pretty O
certain O
that O
the O
persons O


of O
either O
sex O
whom O
all O
the O
world O
treats O
ill O
, O
deserve O
entirely O
the O
treatment O


they O
get O
. O
The O
world O
is O
a O
looking O
 O
glass O
, O
and O
gives O
back O
to O
every O
man O
the O


reflection O
of O
his O
own O
face O
. O
Frown O
at O
it O
, O
and O
it O
will O
in O
turn O
look O
sourly O


upon O
you O
: O
laugh O
at O
it O
and O
with O
it O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
jolly O
kind O
companion O
; O
and O


so O
let O
all O
young O
persons O
take O
their O
choice O
. O
This O
is O
certain O
, O
that O
if O
the O


world O
neglected O
Miss O
Sharp BPERSON
, O
she O
never O
was O
known O
to O
have O
done O
a O
good O


action O

nor O
can O
it O
be O
expected O
that O
twenty BCARDINAL

as O

as O
the O

it O
could O

that O

be O
of O
the O

of O

Miss O

a O

When O

he O
used O

beat O
his O

and O
the BTIME
next ITIME

, O
with O
a O

, O
he O


used O

The O

of O

Miss O

never O

used O
to O
state O

that O

took O

it O

that O
as O

Rebecca BPERSON

her O

It O
was O
in O
those BDATE

rather O
a O
rare O
accomplishment O

and O
led O
to O
her O
engagement O
with O
the O

For O
her O

finding O
him O


self O
not O
likely O

, O
after O
his O

to O

had O

the O

the O


idea O

even O

of O
such O
an O

a O

of O
Miss BPERSON

who O
would O
have O

away O
Miss O

that O

the O

Dobbin BPERSON

suppose O
that O
this O

he O
chose O

as O
she O
thought O
over O
her O

So O
she O

determined O
to O
render O
her O

comfortable O

As O
my O
Lady O

was O
not O
one O
of O

a O

, O


moreover O
, O
so O
indolent O

not O

quence O
in O

Rebecca BPERSON

found O
that O

to O

her O
good O

— O
indeed O
, O
impossible O
to O

She O
used O
